"This game is pretty grindy.  over all it runs smooth, English translation is a mess but the Dev knows that and says they are working on replacing it.  There is a lot I would like to see upgraded. I want the see more skills and more characters. I would like to see a way to speed up the battling, because besides picking the characters there is not interaction in the battle.  There is an odd scroll random unlock system reminiscent of a mobile game that seems irrelevant for the most part. You can by all the options and I found the scrolls really just gave me currency. 

The ""art"" is fine, and the game is pretty challenging to get to the end. 

Over all I think this game has a lot of potential and I could see me changing my recommend vote down the line with more updates. It just needs some work.",1,0

"As much I really like when Gunfire drops a new content to mess with it for couple more hours. I like and hate this DLC 

You gain 2 new Heroes, Owl and Raccoon also 4 new weapons for a really low price like in previous DLC. 
BUT
Like in DLC1 most of the weapons are f*cking dogsh*t :
- Brick is a really powerful weapon in the Sniper category being one of the best early game weapon for all characters and mid-endgame weapon for Lei Luo (Tiger) 

- Jet Octopus it's another Injector that you would skip/sell every single time you see it. I like the idea by tickling enemies and using Alt-Fire to do massive damage BUT meter that you need to full in for that ALT-Fire takes too long and takes your ammo by making you pretty much useless on the field 

- Wolf Gaze we finally got a new SMG since Scalpel was added 2 years ago. Shortly another cool looking automatic weapon that really really suck d*ck

- Star Ring f*cking sucks and it's really clunky to use 

Heroes :
- Zi Xiao (Owl) by just messing around a little bit looks like a really cool endgame character but the amount of the really stupid information really hurts your brain and you don't even know what you're doing. As the early-midgame 3-5/10 as the lategame 7-8/10

-Nona (Raccoon) really fun character to play a bit squishy, but the thing that you can build around the Robot making him you're Meat Shield and some sort main DPS source is really fun and feels fresh 

Free stuff and update :
As usual they added tons of the cool scrolls for free, little changes to some gemini's and inscriptions.
No buffs for weapons that scream ""BUFF ME"", I'm looking at you SMG and Assault Rifle category
In DLC1 characters were ok but new weapons are a lackluster. 

Otherwise for that really low pricetag you can still spend more time in the game mess around with the new stuff
Remember to have fun and don't take everything seriously, everyone's opinion can always change and the review is only to point things out",0,1

The game is average. Graphics for the girls were good but for guys they need improvement. The MC looks odd and the beard on his friend looks fake. dialog is poor and not really worth reading. there are really just two stories where you pick good/evil option. the sex is where they spent most of their time and with a few exceptions its pretty good but far from the premier games. It was on sale and i think i got my money's worth but will not be purchasing the next version.,0,1

"I was really against this game as I adore BELT scrollers and always thought myself pretty decent at them, but all this game did was kick my butt over and over again, and I didn't like the button layout.
Yes, I had initially given this game a do not recommend rating. I am happy to lose all my review likes and say that this has changed to a recommended since the issues have been fixed.

I still bemoan the lack of online multiplayer, since shredder's revenge recently showed me how much fun a single older gamer like myself can have with 5 other random players online, but truth be told it's not something I'd expect from an indie developer.. It's something I really want and we can't always have what we want. 
Perhaps if this game is hugely successful and a lot of customers make it known that they want this too, it could make it into a future sequel.

The game is very arcadey - i.e. hard, on standard difficulties.. I put it at about arcade final fight difficulty, but they added a new casual mode which is much much easier. 
For me anyway, beat em ups are games I like to play through multiple times a year, so I am happy to get the feel of the game and play through it in casual, to then tackle it later at the normal, harder difficulties. There's also a cheat code for infinite health that you can find with a quick google, but I really don't want to play through a game that way so have managed to resist!

I also complained about lack of controller bumper and trigger support. Whilst this hasn't been fully rectified, as in, you can't button map manually, they have added back attack on left bumper, combo finisher on right and block on right trigger. I would very much like to swap block to right bumper, but it's already made a huge difference for back attacks, not having to press X and Y together. In fact it has completely transformed the game.
Also, I believe they should update the control area to SHOW what the triggers and bumpers do in each control preset choice (there are 24 which are just variations of the diamond layout and I don't know if they change the trigger choices as they don't say, and I am not going to try all 24).

Gorgeous 16 bit graphics but in hi res and great soundtracks that really drive each stage, and satisfying combat all make this a very fun game, even alone.

That's it in a nutshell really... If you like scrolling beat em ups, like the Streets of Rage Series, or Final Fight, or indeed Turtles - then what is on offer here is more of that.
If you don't like those kind of games, there's nothing here to convince you otherwise as it plays the same as all the good ones do. The combat and response time feels right, the sound is on point to drive along the action and it's unrelenting enemy after enemy and a heck of a lot of button mashing (with some tactics due to block and special button for ground attacks).
The move set is basically a mirror of SOR3 + added ground kicking .

There are a few weapons scattered about also, the standard fare of knives and pipes and bats, but you can also throw drain covers like a frisbee which is cool I guess. I always want better weapons in beat em ups so this is something I always miss in almost all of them, The Takedown had guns which was such a nice change, and although brief in usage, they were incredibly satisfying and I'd honestly like to see more of that kind of weapon in the future. 

Basically, this game sticks to the formula of the best brawlers and that's enough for me, but it's not doing anything to really stand out as such. I enjoyed Mother Russia Bleeds, 99 Vidas, SOR4, Shredder's Revenge, and I'll enjoy this just the same. Not more or less, the same. I'll play it through and get good at it, then play it through every now and then for a satisfying half hour of action gaming.
That for me made it worth spending the money, and I'm finally happy with my purchase!",0,1

"多用心打磨一下剧本吧，就是靠剧本火的。相比《烟火》只有画面进步，剧情、叙事和游戏性都变潦草了，要素过多没有融合到一体变成缝合怪，人物增多，但很多角色都刻画不够。总体70分吧，steam只有好评和差评，那就给差评了。
1、民俗玄学不够玄，科学悬疑又没有解释清楚，两手抓两手都漏。DEMO里佛像悬疑感拉满，然而故事和佛教没有什么关系，甚至佛教元素只有造型上的作用。用科学去解释也解释不通，光碟是谁做的，谁发的消息都没有解释。破案全靠幻觉，没有任何证物。
2、反派塑造空洞，也不算高智商，也不算有后台，打败他们的方法也很降智。折腾半天没有触及幕后黑手，也不知道这个故事算完结不算。三人组凶案那么多，也没看出“上面”对他们有多重视，竟然没有警察去调查任何一起命案。沈副都说了有人监视这三人，还能让事情发展成到这个地步。在没有证据的情况下，突然把杨击毙了。既然能击毙，那早就可以击毙了，不需要等死了一个临时工再击毙。不知道主角最后怎么想出来计划用幻觉打败反派。他们两人产生幻觉那么久，都活的好好的。为什么认为给反派制造幻觉就能制服他？
3、为了煽情赚眼泪强行刀女主，用的还是烟火同款刀。一而再再而三献祭拥有美好品质的女孩，让我不得不用一些恶意揣测作者。烟火老师是故事的一环，前期铺垫也到位，所以她的死固然让人意难平，但非常合理，流畅。邱芜的死①对剧情没有任何作用。她是局外人调查人员啊。②没有必然性。前期没有铺垫，有无数种方法可以避免，甚至可以坠楼重伤。作者偏偏强行让她死了。同一个凶手，徐活了下来，邱坠楼就死了。③意识形态上让人不爽。她不是警察！就不应该安排她做这么危险的事！她完全是被利用了，导致雇她的沈副局动机模棱两可。
4、我知道一触及社会黑暗面就有人高潮，什么“好敢写”，“现实比故事更黑暗”。如果想写制度黑暗，就写制度黑暗，现在这样只是蹭蹭又不深入。硬套西方孤胆英雄套路，体制腐败没有可以信赖的人，能相信的只有体制外的人，最后体制外的人知道真相，没有力量搬到幕后黑手只能亡命天涯。不考虑适合不适合故事环境，徐带着小女孩隐姓埋名就变得莫名其妙，躲去哪躲谁？
5、叶医生加进来，对他的过去又没有描述，只是过来打个酱油，买个莫名其妙的情怀。
真的沉下心好好打磨剧本吧。不是有中国民俗就是中国故事的。",1,0

Gems of Destiny is a match-three puzzle game that follows the adventures of a dwarf named Axel, who sets out from his homeland to discover the world. During his journey, his stumbles upon a forest that has been destroyed by goblins. We are then introduced to Willow, a dryad of the forest that survived the attack. Together they team up and rebuild the land using Axel's dwarven ingenuity and skills. 

I absolutely love match-three puzzles, I've played some Bejeweled in my time, some Candy Crush, but what brought me to love match-three games is Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords. I won't compare games, so I will talk solely about Gems of Destiny: Homeless Dwarf. 

Gems of Destiny attempts to bring a lot to the table but ultimately fails. The only two attractions that allure you into playing it are the story and the gameplay. At the end of the day, at the time of me writing this, both seem good at first, but once you've put some time into it, you realise there is less and less content. I've put in 2 hours playing this game, and I've completed it. The price of the game, the time spent playing, and the amount of content that it provides is not worth it in my opinion (keeping in mind I personally received a free review copy, but the fact still stands), especially when there are so many games in the match-three genre to choose from.

Firstly, the gameplay and its flaws. It's the standard match-three you know and love, the objectives include: 

collecting a certain number of y-colored gems, clearing webbed/frozen board blocks, clearing crystals by matching adjacent gems three times, and clearing trees by matching adjacent gems two to three times. You match 4 and you get a line clear gem of the same colour gem, you match 5 and you get a special gem that can pick an adjacent gem and all gems of that selected gem get cleared. you match 5 in an L shape and you get a bomb clear gem of the same colour. 

The problem and flaw in the game, is the fact that if the objective is to clear x amount of webbed or frozen blocks, you can literally use a certain booster (won't say which one) which clears ALL of the webbed or frozen blocks and it immediately clears the level. Sometimes there are two objectives, but you can make it one with this simple trick. This removes the challenge in the game, makes certain levels redundant, and overall makes the game simply too easy. Even when I was not using this trick, the game did not feel challenging enough, and it did not fully satisfy the match-three itch I had. There was also a visual error where sometimes I cleared gems but one gem doesn't go away and it overlapped with the new gem that takes its spot. There is also no way to remove the hints that assist you in matching. Another thing I noticed is that if you are stuck, the algorithm somehow spawns gems to eventually get you unstuck, effectively making sure you don't fail the mission unless you purposely expend too many moves.

Secondly, the story, I appreciate the story and the fact that it even has one. It is simple and easy to understand. But the amount of effort in the world building is weak and in the end, I did not care for the cause of rebuilding the land. It was simply do a level, get points, rebuild a building, run out of points, do another level until I can afford the next building, rinse and repeat. There were also grammatical errors, missing letters in words, and this is also ironically evident in their game description where they refer Axel as Alex 6 times. Once I completed the story at level 72, there was nothing left for me to do but continue to do the remaining levels with no incentive. So I did levels 72-75 but I gave up as there was no real motive, with the booster exploit and nothing left to unlock, no more dialogues to go through, I would also not see the characters again. 

The game simply isn't ambitious enough with its content and efforts to keep me playing for longer, there is also no way to start the game again (unless you search for the save and delete it I assume). I also cannot overlook the bugs, grammatical and visual errors and finally, the exploits in a puzzle game that is meant to challenge me to think.",1,0
"Frustratingly hard. There's a lot going on here and it's pretty dim, along with a PITA ball save that feels like it's rigged to make me swear.

"[i]Disclaimer: I was a Kickstarter backer for this game.

Sweetcore Brews[/i] is a fantasy romcom otome/yuri VN hybrid about a young witch, Milly, who works brewing magical teas for the shop she's employed at.

The story is split up into episodes, with all of them (except the final episode) being split up into three chapters. At the end of each chapter, it might give you one of three minigames: a match-3 minigame, a mad libs minigame where you type in several nouns to put in a recipe, and a mad libs minigame where you input names and words to create advice for customers' problems. While I enjoyed the match-3 game (which is simple but still fun), both of the mad libs variants wore out their welcome very quickly. Eventually I just started putting spaces into the blanks just to get past them.

The game...doesn't really have much of a plot. It mostly relies on a ""situation of the week"" type structure, where Milly and the LI(s) get into a problem that was caused and/or is solved by Milly's tea brewing. A lot of the humor comes from the bizarre things that Milly mixes into her teas, and the wacky effects the teas can have. At the end of each route, there's a longer-than-usual episode that brings in aspects from previous episodes as Chekhov's guns to increase stakes, which ends up being kind of mood whiplash considering how lighthearted most of the game is.

Because the game has very little plot until the end, I would highly recommend only buying the game if you like [i]both[/i] of the love interests. (Zero is a flirtatious type who starts getting touchy-feely with Milly almost immediately after they meet; Kingsley is the classic ""cold-ish uber-rich guy with a heart of gold"" trope.) If you only like one, you're missing out on nearly half of the game's content, and there's no story to make sitting through the LI you dislike worth it. Trying out the browser-based demo on itchio or the F2P mobile version might be a good idea if you're on the fence about it.

The game has optional softcore text-only sex scenes, which according to the store page are marked so that they can be easily avoided. This is...sort of true. When you pick the ""spicy"" option, a confirmation screen pops up asking if you want to proceed. But there's no visual indicator on the choice menu itself. The game also doesn't tell you that the spicy option is always the last option, so from the perspective of a player who hasn't figured it out for themself yet, if you specifically want that option, you have to randomly guess and hope you get it right the first time (it's not always obvious from the choice text).

Unlike most romance VNs, Sweetcore Brews allows you to go on both routes at the same time in the same playthrough. However, while you can do this and the routes sometimes merge into each other to allow Milly to flirt and be flirted with both LIs at the same time, there's no proper polyamory route; the endings for each route are pretty clear about being monogamous, even if you've pursued both LIs. The game doesn't advertise a polyam route, so I'm not disappointed, but it's kind of a strange structure decision to make.

While this game was released simultaneously on both PC and mobile, it's very clear that the UX was designed primarily for mobile with PC being an afterthought. It's not unusable by any means, but it's a bit counterintuitive on PC. The biggest examples are the game expecting you to navigate through menus by clicking and dragging them instead of just using the scroll wheel (you [i]can[/i] use the scroll wheel, but a full scroll only moves the scroll a few pixels, so it's easier to just click-and-drag) and not having keyboard shortcuts for most things. There's also no auto function and no ability to skip only read text (and the skip function takes you to the next choice or to the last sentence before the end of the chapter rather than being a fast-forward).

Also IDK why the page says it's a simulation, there are literally zero sim aspects to the game. It's a pure VN with occasional match-3 and mad libs segments. You don't actually run Milly's shop, do any stat-raising, etc.

And this is a really small nitpick, but it's kind of disappointing that you never get to see the MC outside of CGs (of which there are only two per route). Her design is so cute! I know a lot of otome game readers don't like to see the MC, but something like a toggle for a side image would be nice. It just feels like a waste to have such a cute design for her and then basically never show her, lol.

I know that seems like a lot of negatives, but I really did enjoy this game, and I don't regret backing it on KS. But the combination of the structure and technical issues makes it really hard to give it an unqualified recommendation. That said, I'm looking forward to seeing what the developers do in the future, especially if they can work out the snags in their PC porting.

"One of those cool ""intuit what to do"" type games with no text and no real guidance, but it's admittedly a bit linear which does take away some of the exploration elements, unfortunately. The way the different puzzles interweave with each other is neat and the presentation is gorgeous, albeit I feel like the last puzzle set dragged way too long compared to the rest of the game. This feels like a small demo of what could be a much more involved game but for what it is, it's pretty cool - just, like, a bit short, as most all the Cosmos 9 games are.

As for the bundle as a whole... it really feels like a game jam that they're making you pay to play. Half the games are either tech demos or just feel... unpolished, and they're all a bit too far on the short side to be particularly engaging. And there's no real cohesion between the graphical design or the controls meaning the whole ""console"" gimmick doesn't really hold up. The whole set is definitely a bit overpriced and even at the 50% off price point I can't say it felt worth the time I spent with them all. 

If you do have to get any games in this pack, Triga is probably worth full price, Linelith and IFO are pretty cool albeit a bit underdeveloped and probably worth it on sale, and maaaaybe Tendy and Frequency Dissonance are worth it on sale but those are hard to recommend otherwise, and the other four are either too tedious or too underdeveloped to be even worth your time, so I'd give the bundle as a whole a pass.",0,1

"Bare-bones wave shooter with repetitive and grindy gameplay. 

There’s no story here. You are apparently the lone survivor that has to fight against the never-ending army of enemies in order to save what’s left of the destroyed village. 

The game doesn’t cost a lot so it’s no surprise that it comes with very limited and pretty boring gameplay. Other than being able to shoot arrows, your character has no special abilities. No magic tricks, traps, or even a dash to escape danger exist. Due to the fact that it slows you down and has a low power, the ability to charge your shot is practically useless.

Shooting works fine despite some issues. It doesn’t happen often, but sometimes the character will choose to shoot in a completely different direction after you have pointed in one direction. The other bug happens when you smash the mouse button too fast and you get stuck in the charging animation. 

There is only one map with three entry points for monsters and one with a shop. The approach doesn't change even as the waves get harder and harder. You run around the area in a circle and take occasional shots at the chasing enemies. You can only fire one shot before running for a few seconds and repeating because you are a little faster than the enemy. You can't win right away, so the game requires a lot of grinding.

By taking out enemies and gathering bags that appear all over the arena, you can make money. You have roughly 40 seconds to upgrade in the shop after finishing a wave. Because the clock never stops, you have to act quickly. On the other hand, I wish there was a button to start a wave earlier.

The shop provides you with various traditional choices, like health, speed, and multi-shot upgrade, which is the only route to victory. Another choice you must make is whether to spend less money on enhancements that only last one game or save up for more costly permanent upgrades. 

But there’s another catch. The cost of every item in the shop increases when you purchase an upgrade. The more useful the upgrade, the higher the ""tax"". The upgrade that increases the amount of gold at the start of each run is the only one that doesn’t have it, so it’s smart to invest here first.

The adult content is just a reward for grinding and not very satisfying. You need to unlock a random chance of getting a sexy picture in the shop, but since it costs the same as the best upgrade, you’re better off spending the money on things that will get you further.",0,1

"This game, this exact same game took me back to the 80s. Last night I played it and since it's set in 1980 I got used to that timeline. I went to bed and fell asleep, I woke up at 42AM per burger when I realised that I was living in 1980 for real. I went to the corner shop and asked the mangal what year we are living in to which he replied 2023 - 43 AND I JUMPED BECAUSE I GOT SCARED! I WAS LITERALLY going back in time. I tried to call my cousin to tell him what happened. I took out my iPhone from my pocket  but there was no coverage. I asked the mangal if there is a way to call someone and he told me to go to the central part of my city and find a Bulphone slushalka, I told him that I have an iPhone but no coverage and he asked ""Bruda, wodafuc is an eyephone?"" I said ""a brick with a screen that you can use to contact friends and get brainwashed"". I realized iphoned didn't exist in 1980 so I basically had tech from the future that was very valuable. The CIA tracked me down because they knew im a time traveler and tried to arrest me. I ran away from them and stole a Plymouth Baracuda from the local spaceship dealership. I drove for 59 hours per eagle and i ran out of fuel in the middle of UAE. Some random jamaican gyals stared dancing on the roof of my car when I played ""Badder dan dem"" on my CarPlay in the stolen Baracuda. I found some muffins in the exhaust but they had petrol taste so i washed them at the local pub but the water there was full of fungus because the drunk people threw up in the sink an hour before i went there. I asked Siri how to download ""Minecraft"" on windows 95, Siri said buy the game but download it first. LOL i jumped off a cliff and woke up in 2023 when I realized that I WAS DREAMING the whole time. I washed my eyes and fell asleep on the roof because it was colder there, and in the house was very hot. Oy bruv, i needa go naw. Cya in 201980.

"Highly influenced by the ""Centurion: Defender of Rome"", but focused on the Gaul conquest. That is a nice game, but:

very simple management and More like simplistic axis & allies game on the map phase. Every turn regions at hand provide money and you use that to buy armies or food. Thats it. Dont expect more from that one. 

No interaction with the cities (build and improve etc). Just buy food from local farmers, or pillage it. That is the only interaction.

Gauls seem to be able to raise armies on every region but Romans can only do that on their start city. (which is a grinder to move them to the front in the mid-term)

No-man power issues. You (and the enemy) can raise armies as long as there are adequate funds. That is a bit immersion breaking though, all the people got killed on those battles... do not contribute in the war effort :) 

On the combat phase, its more like Centurion-game like battles, more control on your untis somehow.  you have to select to throw pilums for your units because they dont do that on their own. 

Enemy archers can put a good fight against roman cavalary ?  still couldnt undertsand how?

tutorial is not an in game tutor, but more like a text to read page after another page. 

testudo formation is ok, but it doesnt say it has any effect (positive of negative) on the melee fight. No explanation.
Velities, how effective are they, attack defend? these information is not available. 

Sound effects are nice, people screaming when they charge swords clash.. etc. Music is good indeed.

Before us is the second game ""Smartly Gophered Games"", which has not acquired its value. We can simply explore the map in an off-road vehicle, either alone or with friends. But there isn't much to explore here. There are no tasks, plots or goals in the game. Therefore, the possibility of creating a server for 8 players is not very clear.
Although this game positions itself as a ""racing"" simulator, there is no one to go to races with. And if you decide to compete with a friend or a random player, then most likely you will disperse in different directions, since it is quite difficult to agree on a route.

"It is quite medicore to say at least. Combat system is simple and easy to learn but it gets boring rather quickly. In game cutscenes are beautiful but there is just a few of them and usually the story is told via pictures ripped from anime and voiced over by the actors. 

I recommend this game to the fans of the show longing to rekindle the good memories they had with the anime.  I do not recommend it to anyone else tho. Not for this price, not for the story-telling. 

If you want to learn about this universe, just watch anime. 
If you want a simple, hack & slash game in which you don't have to think too much... Sure, but I would recommend waiting on sale.

"You will never be a real Hebrew. You have no priests, you have no temple. You are a Jew twisted by legalism and demons into a crude mockery of God's Chosen People.

All the ""blessings"" you get are two-faced and conditional(?). Behind your backs Gentiles mock you. The Lord is disgusted and ashamed of you, your ""allies"" laugh at your goblinoid appearance behind closed doors.

The Faithful are utterly repulsed by you. Thousands of years of Christian teachings have allowed Gentiles to sniff out frauds with incredible efficiency. Even Jews who ""converso"" sound uncanny and UnChristlike to a Gentile. Your banking practices are a dead giveaway. And even if you manage to get a ""Shabbos Goy"" to come home with you, he'll turn tail and bolt the second he gets a hint of your diseased, perverse home circumcisions.

You will never be happy. You wrench out a crooked grin every single morning and tell yourself it's going to be ok. But deep inside you feel the seperation from God creeping up like a Cross, ready to condemn you with the unbearable weight of your sins.

Eventually it will be too much to bear - you won't be able to buy adrenachrome, your skin shall turn to dust, your phylactery will shatter, and you will face God's Judgement. Your neighbors will find you, heartbroken at your condemnation but relieved that they will no longer have to bear your evil and sinful ways. They will bury you with a headstone marked with your Khazarian name, and every passerby for the rest of Eternity will know that a Jew is buried there. Your body wil ldecay and go back to the dust, and all that will remain of your legacy is a soul that is unmistakeably Damned.

Dear fellow gamers, I am excited to share my thoughts on the steamy visual novel, Lust Island. This game promises a tantalizing adventure filled with seductive women and intimate encounters, leaving me feeling both intrigued and conflicted. While the characters' appearances and erotic scenes left me breathless, the unfortunate presence of a major bug prevents me from wholeheartedly endorsing this title just yet.

Upon starting the game, you find yourself stranded on a mysterious island alongside 4 captivating ladies and one mysterious island dweller : your current girlfriend, a former lover, a sizzling lesbian model, A book Nerd and an enigmatic newcomer whose past remains shrouded in mystery. As you navigate through their company, tensions rise and passions ignite, leading to various intimate escapades. The artwork is satisfactory enough to pique interest, although some details could have been sharper. The highlight, however, undoubtedly lies in the steamy and well-animated lovemaking sequences; unfortunately, these moments are far too brief, leaving me yearning for more.

The narrative itself is engaging, presenting unexpected twists and turns that keep players guessing until the very end. It's crucial to note, though, that if you accidentally click on objects around the island without following specific instructions, the tale can become repetitive, causing unwanted gameplay issues. Thankfully, aside from this technical flaw, the plot is solid, making it easy to immerse oneself in the titillating tale.

But let us talk about the star of the show - the ladies themselves! Each woman brings something unique and irresistible to the table, driving the player wild at every turn. From luscious curves to piercing gazes, these bombshells will have you blushing and sweating simultaneously. Trust me, the sight of them is enough to send chills down anyone's spine.

In conclusion, while Lust Island's gameplay mechanics are somewhat lacking in certain areas, such as the overly concise sex scenes and irritating bugs, the unforgettable cast of characters makes up for these shortcomings tenfold. If you're looking for a steamy, thrilling adventure, then look no further than this game. However, beware that certain aspects may require extra attention or additional downloads to ensure seamless play. Until the developers address these kinks, I must reluctantly hold off on fully endorsing this title. So, proceed at your own risk, but rest assured that once these minor issues are resolved, you won't regret diving into this sea of sensuality. Remember, touch stress the sexy and horny aspect!

My rating: [3/5] Stars (Recommended with Caution)

Potential Fixes:

    Longer Sex Scenes: Extending the duration of each encounter would elevate the entire experience to another level.
    Bug Fixes: Addressing the aforementioned issue would prevent players from becoming frustrated and improve overall enjoyability.

Remember, always prioritize safety first when consuming adult material, and never forget to practice responsible gaming habits. Happy playing!

"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1,0

When muscles were contracted they would sometimes outright destroy themselves and the contraption they were apart of. And you could also just have an infinite amount of muscle cells as placing one places three which can then all be individually mined to produce three cells from one. 
lots of other issues
- Confusing to navigate as if you go too far you get lost
- UI is confusing as progress is tracked haphazardly (?)
- So many unnamed cells with just numbers that seem fascinating but don't seem to do anything??
- Muscles and connective tissue seem to outright destroy things sometimes and sometimes the machines they make up
- End goal is vague and ultimately hard to achieve due to this (Make a heart???)
- No tutorials, I felt like I had to bang rocks together to learn

"I wish there was a neutral vote to this.
In general, this is not a bad game, but it falls a bit short.

I feel for the developer, as someone dealing with the exact feelings they portray on the game.
Yet, the gameplay doesn't bring anything new, nor actually creates a connected story or a sense of achievement by going around and clicking on random things, which are pretty disconnected from eachother.

The jumpscare doesn't add anything to the plot as well. It's a cheap mechanism that doesn't add up.
The notes in the diary could be meaningful, if they actually helped you advance in the game, as opposed to simply being there.

The simple UI is one of the ok elements. The music might be the best thing in the game.

"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1,0

"Interesting. I dislike how long it takes before the player assumes first person tank controls. I'd naturally assume it is just a collection of procedural scenes, if I hadn't decided to wait to a supposed end.

The plots are kind of interesting, the randomization needs work. Picking a number from 1 to 3 could be interesting, if there was information about what each number means, otherwise you might as well just randomize without user input.

I played two games. In the first, everyone rose, collected babies, went outside and stood in a pool of water.
In the second, everyone was woken up by a siren with blue lights, then they went outside, got a child, and stood in a pool of water. After that, I terminated the program.

Feedback: I think you need either more plots, or a system in place to prevent the same outcome from happening twice, if it is random. Also change the control type, first-person tank controls are kind of a nightmare, coupled with the fact that you can sprint, but you still turn left and right at a fixed rate.

Finally, at the very beginning of the game, it was so laggy when I was clicking and dragging to draw a sign it took about a second and I could visibly see each texture being added, instead of just an appearing line. You should probably figure out the cause of this, and optimize the game.",1,0

My Monstrous Roomate which is my favourite is like a poetic blend with a dash of nightmare to make an intangible emotion  come alive

Pyramid curse was like watching an informational slideshow, with the horror mostly stemming from the situation being mortifying when explained at its full. It goes ""ok here is some stuff we're going to show you"" lets you control some things, view some things, more stuff explained with text and treats it alot like a neatly documented instance of horror rather than something that is only fathomable to glimpse at.

"nice compact map packed with interesting spots that you can get really creative, although the big quarter pipes brings me a question of why haven't they still even bothered to improve the transition skating till now

my main grief is actually just how it looks- the thing i LOVE about Session's base maps is how genuine they feel. streets are mostly true to their real life counterparts with a lot of things that most of the tourists wouldn't really want to see, like a pile of litters sitting down in the corner of the street or an entire block full of worn out concrete buildings. it gives so much life to wherever you go in this game even without the pedestrians but it's simply not the case with this DLC

a bunch of graffiti that are just stamped on the wall and floor texture rather than feeling like they're actually drawn by some locals around the place, lot of colors feel like they're just there because they obligatory had to, and most of the ramps and objects are conveniently placed for skating rather than blending into the place. honestly it has that ""corporate punk"" vibe all around which you can find in titles like Riders Republic and later THPS games(THPS wore it better tho)

this artistic direction actually gives me more concern about the future of this game because i believe a lot of people who've been here since the kickstarter~early access days should also got the appeal from how genuine the whole thing feels, and how it makes you see the street in the same way we do irl skating. if Session follows the same path with being another ""Hot Topic: The Game"" it's not only the problem of presentation and atmosphere but also the gameplay itself and the general experience

that's a lot of thoughts with a mere single DLC map from me but still, yea",1,0

"Not really sure about the negative or positive, but maybe it is just not my type of game. The game is beautiful and very well made, the mechanics are simple, but the 'strategy' and 'base building' elements aren’t as important as I had hoped.

Throughout my first playthrough, I started to understand that merging buildings from lower levels to higher levels is not really how the game is played best. It is much better to just get a combo to get some cards, which gives you higher level placeable buildings and allow to move buildings around the map freely. So, if you just reserve some space to make a 5-9 combination of level 1 or 2 buildings, the game is pretty easy. I got all achievements in about half an hour, which isn’t that challenging.

It's free, so it’s not a bad shout to see whether the game is for you, but I just think that after this playthrough, I’m not really interested in setting some high score, playing it again or buying the full game.

"This is a really challenging dlc to review and I have gone back and forth between leaving a positive and a negative review. In short, if you really like any of the specific animals included and don't mind the cost of the pack then go for it, but if you were hoping for a more extensive overhaul of the lagoon system I am sorry to say that this pack and the accompanying update is more of baby steps than a true remaster.

The animals all look nice, I personally don't care for the inclusion or design of the dunkleosteus but it certainly doesn't look bad, the shonisaurus is among the best looking animals in the game, archelon looks very solid and while I thought I would hate nothosaurus because of the cartoony elements (which cannot be attributed to frontier because the design is literally from a cartoon) it has grown on me significantly.

That said, since my launch review I mentioned that the lagoon system was incredibly basic and felt unfinished. Marine animals really didn't do anything but slowly swim around, they had no social interactions, no jumping out of the water, speeding around, unique behaviors, interaction with land or flying animals, interactions with guests, etc. With this update the only changes are giving each animal (except the two mosasaurs for unclear reasons) a single social interaction animation, and two animals in this pack have a rock they can sit on. As nice as these new animals are and as needed as social interaction was it feels like a bandaid to much larger issues and it is frustrating how close to greatness this was.

To go over a few things that this pack didn't have, but could greatly benefit from...
- The Marine animals have no way to interact with guests, meaning if bad times are going on in your park, the marine animals are not a component and a park that has majority of them is effectively safe from any danger. This dlc added a new, in tank viewing area and the base game had viewing windows. I cannot believe how much of a missed opportunity it was to instead of having upset fish ram their heads into the wall, have them attack viewing structures. This would cause them to burst and have the guests be flung into the water column where the marine animals can attack them
- The nothosaurus in particular is a small amphibious creature, if angered it could potentially climb out of the tank and attack guests on foot. While this would require extra animations it would not need as many as the primary land animal and it already has some of these due to the rock enrichment
- We have seen over time moments from the films added as gameplay mechanics; the raptors can commune with the indominus rex, this patch added the jp3 spino neck snap move, etc. In the films we saw pterosaurs carrying people into the lagoons and being attacked themselves. Imagine a flock of pterosaurs, if near a lagoon, dropping guests in to the mercy of the marine animals, or if they fly over being snagged themselves. Similarly to the irex in the first jurassic world you could potentially have marine animals snag land dinosaurs too close to the edge but I recognize this would be a lot harder to get working than the other suggestions.
- All water in the game is incredibly murky and blurry. Why not let you change water quality as you can in planet zoo?
- Animals should have much more behaviors. Breaching out of the water, swimming faster, resting, perhaps more interactions with each other or other species to make up for lack of gameplay elements land animals have
- More water decor, especially that the animals could interact with. Kelp animals can play with, coral scratching posts they can drag themselves against, smooth spots for them to rest while cleaning fish tend to them, etc

Finally, while this is way way too late to do, I feel that this game had an enormous missed opportunity from the get go. We have never had a map that is a true island we can customize fully, we always get boundaries near the beach. In the original Jurassic World film guests did not arrive via plane or monorail but from large boats. Imagine if instead of being trapped in lagoons they can never escape, you kept marine species in the ocean using nets and gates similar to what we saw for the mosa in the second jw movie. If they got upset they could destroy the nets/sea walls and escape into the ocean, and could then ram the ships if small to dislodge a few guests and attack, or if large enough destroy the entire ship. You could then have had a special ACU ship that you could ride out to tranq the animal like you do with the jeep, or just use the chopper if that would be too tricky to set up. I know it is way too late for something like this but it feels like it would have worked so much better.

tl;dr animals are pretty but lagoons still feel lackluster. Its a welcome step in the right direction but we aren't there yet",1,0

"ighty so. this platform just came out and has yet to get updates to greatly improve upon what it has going for it. This is because rn its picking up where NEOSVR left off. I expect to update this review over time, so for now you are very much going to have to pay attention to the ""early access"" and low hour count on writing this review. (but hey at least this time I wont sound so pissy like I did b4)

so, leme keep it brief. you may have head of this being ""the VRChat competitor"" (as if ChilloutVR wasnt putting that much of competition). Is it really? and to what metric are we talking about here? to put it bluntly its a lot more hobbyist that VRC. Resonite is advertised as being primarily made for PCVR and the platform pretty much requires you to have beefy hardware to play it decently. if your edge is to enjoy funny minigames on the quest3, this might not b your thing. I feel that what you are ment to do in Resonite is to treat it like a scientific tool for computer VR musings, tho you are welcome to make gamemodes within it, and it does work well enough for that.

preformancewise, yes you do need an ""epic gamer"" setup to be able to run Resonite at a ""OKAY"" framerate. While the Froox engine is very preformant, the unity rendering pipeline is noticeably holding it back. I personally am used to running VR at 20FPS with a bunch of old VRC thugs so Im personally not horribly bothered by this. (then again its not like I boot up Resonite in VR mode all the time, the desktop mode is good enough but it aint no true ""editor program"" experience, more of a ""minecraft redstone engineering"" sort of vibe to the workflow.)

I advise ppl that wana give Resonite a shot to come into this platform with an expectation of your first moments being very hands on and involved, and dare a say ""a struggle"". While you do have a decent cast of mentors and hardcore fans of the Froox Engine that are a bit more than enthusiastic to assist you, bear in mind it still wont be so easy. but, I feel that for the people that are serious about Resonite, you probably arent looking for anything easy, you might be looking for a hardmode take on VRChat at the benefit of having a bit more built in freedom.

do you have to have a Major in Computer Science, or Engineering to adequately play this platform? No, but it does help massively tho. REALLY what you need is the ""Ima die trying to solve my practical problems"" mindset/grindset and an unwillingness to give up easily. I dont think many people on average have what it takes.

I quite like this platform, I know this because of how often when I get my ""mad scientist itch"" Resonite is one of the many things that i will reach for to try stuff out in. I... well I have the hour count in the old place to prove my point via a measurable statistic. I don't recommend this platform to the average ""sim"" enjoyer (or VRChat goer), I know this platform well enough that those kinds of ppl would at least feel very out of it here. If you think you wana challenge my assumptions on that, then I encourage you to install the platform and see how far you can take Resonite. You can try but I don't expect many of you to get far without the determination I eluded to a few paragraphs back.

but hey, at least the UI looks less programmer art than it did b4. Also the new homeworld unironically is one of my favorite ""default places"" ever. Ryuvi (and the others that assisted) really is hard carrying the visual direction for YDMS.

stay posted for further updates, YDMS still has ambitious plans for this platform, we shall see if they can live up to such futuristic sounding hype.",1,0

"Heavily dice influenced, would rather bet on horses

Edit: Just finished HWR(Nightmare) difficulty.

TLDR ver.:
Pros: 
Story writing
Equipment Balancing

Cons:
RNG heavy which makes nearly everything unenjoyable

Few things to note:
Yes, still very RNG based. I have had to use every trick(including steroids) i could think of, even with well planned setups, encounters were still very RNG based.
One moment you could be untouchable, next moment a crossbolt to the neck which hits you so hard you feel it all the way to next week. Definetly needs alot of work in the dice roll section. 
If you're one guy facing off 2-3 foes in a row and each time they come out fresh, don't try to shame the player by enforcing peer pressure (timid debuff), no body cares on the battlefield to look in my direction when they have their own fights. Survival comes first.

So those two were the main pet peeves.

Pros:
Love the writing, can really see that a good deal of effort went into the flow of the story, has a certain flavour that is unique in its charm. Would like to experience the future HWR story.
Equiment is well done, very balanced from an RPG perspective although crafting is abit broken (error codes when combining some items)

All in all 5/10 because the dice ruined alot of things, but would recommend for the story

But ok, then I played like 2-3 times. The game seems to have quite nice graphics. 
It's sokoban type of games [in ancient Egypt/Greece setting]. 
Controls [so far] are just WSAD to go/push the crates in front of you, and ""Space"" to interact with some objects [hit crates or ballistae]. 

I was a little uncomfortable without the ability to rotate the screen, because it is not always clear where the passage is in the wall [when I could see the level from only one angle].

I played something like 10 levels, and each level was dedicated 1 new in-game feature. So, the game has good tutorial, with no rush. Loading screens before each levels have detailed description to each new in-game objects in that levels. First puzzles were easy, of course. But still quite good.
The ""campaign"" is not linear - sometimes you can choose from 4 different levels where you want to proceed.

Game description says that the levels have ""replayable"" value, but I don't think so:  I wouldn't beat these same puzzles in second time.

"[h2]Preface[/h2]
Titan Station is a first-person narrative game that doesn't add anything new to the genre but still manages to provide an interesting story with an enigmatic, otherworldly vibe. 
While entertaining overall, the story suffers from oversimplification in an attempt to cover too much ground; the ending feels way too rushed and doesn’t offer the definitive experience I’ve been longing for.


[b]Pros[/b]
+ Stellar graphics
+ Great audiowork, especially with the voiceovers
+ The story starts off powerfully…


[b]Cons[/b]
- … but in the end, it can’t fulfill its purpose
- The ending felt completely rushed
- While the added puzzles were fun to a degree, I don’t necessarily think they are needed


[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h2]The Story[/h2]

The game takes place in an alternate reality, in the distant future of 1999, where enormous advances in the realm of artificial gravity generation enabled long-distance space travel. The main character, David Miller, is a common nobody who has a lot of debt and is in need of money but can't find work.
However, to his biggest surprise at the start of the game, he escapes his problems by obtaining a job on a space station, technically a ‘space gas station’, named Titan Station.

The job looks almost too ideal: he is assigned very simple responsibilities, provided with a comfortable cabin to live in, and, on top of that, paid a sum that will last him the rest of his life. You may be wondering, ""Where is the catch?"" 
As we all know, complications are the backbone of every proper narrative-driven game, and let me tell you: Titan Station gets from 0 to 100 in a blink of an eye.

The story is interesting and has some surprising turns, but the finale didn't live up to my hopes; the game tried to explain too much in the final act, and I ended up being completely lost. All of the game's writing was solid, and the characters were especially well-developed.
You use a walkie-talkie to communicate with the other station staff members. Most conversations have a few different paths you can take, but ultimately they all lead to the same conclusion. 

[h2]The Gameplay[/h2]

Most of the time in the game will be spent traveling from A to B in order to acquire something and then deliver it. The garnish may change, but the underlying mechanism always stays the same.
The story is the focus, as one might expect from the genre, but I found there to be too little opportunity for player interaction. Sure, there are a few notes strewn about, but that doesn't change the fact that the station is largely devoid of interesting features.

I wasn't expecting it, but there are puzzles in the game as well. They're quite simplistic, but they gave me a good challenge. Don't get your hopes up too high, though; all you'll be doing here is linking blocks of color and, on occasion, blending them. It's a nice touch anyway, and it makes sense given the game's style.


[h2]The Visuals and The Sound[/h2]

Titan Station's visuals showcase a rich and evocative setting. The interior of the station exudes desolation and gloom with its unkempt appearance and general air of neglect. The sporadic glimpses of the moon's surface through windows add awe-inspiring beauty to the typically gloomy environment.
However, as I noted earlier, the structure is quite repetitive, and I didn’t really feel the urge to explore every bit of it. 


Titan Station's soundtrack does a great job of setting the mood. A sensation of solitude and suspense is established via the score and sound effects. However, there are times when the voice acting just doesn't cut it and the characters don't feel quite right. On multiple occasions, I felt like David’s voice actor overacted a little bit in a way that was unnecessary in the given situation.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
Titan Station is a completely mediocre narrative-based game in my eyes. Its structure is similar to that of other notable games in the genre, and its story is engaging but doesn't conclude in a fitting manner. It wasn't a terrible game by any stretch, but nothing about it stands out from the pack.

"DLC is fine on its own, nice addition to the game.

However, their implementation of NG+ kinda soured my whole experience with it. Granted, I started playing this game a couple weeks before DLC came out, and finished it the night before. So when I started up to play the DLC the next day, to be greeted with their obtuse implementation of NG+ was not fun. 

You can't NG+ unless you either
- Beat the final boss again on your current save file
- Beat the entire game on NG

Problem with the final boss beat thing, they changed the fight to make it more interesting, so I don't want to spoiler it after just beating it and remove all the buildup. 
And I didn't want to go through NG again.

Sadly, I decided to go through again on the Hard difficulty, got halfway through, and got burnt out. 

Now, they have released an update to make NG+ be playable from the getgo. Great, glad they did it. But it's a little late now, I've been burned by the wishy-washy implementation, and don't want to play again. Kinda bummed, kinda my fault for accidentally starting before the DLC came out.

"Right off the bat the game has no music on the main menu screen? No idea why that is the case. Had me a bit sus at the start. In game there arent many sound effects at all. The only sound you get is fromt the background music and that even cuts out randomly. The game also crashed at least 2 times durin' my playthrough. The platformin' etc was fine but the small things it could use more of (sound effects). The price tag is also a bit much. The game gets a middle thumb from me for now.

"Review based off of precision platformers being my favorite game genre and all-achievementing the game in 48 minutes (though tabbing out here and there).

Well I had a lot of fun with this game... however...

SAOMI is a dash-doublejump precision platformer that wears its celeste inspiration on its sleeves (not sure where it got the doublejump idea from tho), with its main character sprite and artwork bearing blatant similarities to madeline from celeste's sprite and artwork but I'm not too concerned about that. The game is pretty challenging and fun if you're into the genre (or rather maybe not necessarily as challenging if you're into the genre but it isn't really a baby game like this dev's other games appear to be, granted I haven't played them so I can't judge). It may have fixed jump heights and some subtle momentum (NOT referring to the same style of momentum as celeste, more of a mario kind of thing) to learn and fight against which I think can be a fun thing to learn and overcome and I don't think it technically works against the game in any way but I know that might be a dealbreaker for a lot of people so just be aware. The game is challenging enough and fun enough I might try to speedrun it a little bit or something but that's just me. My main problem with the game though that makes me give it a negative review is that the level design is very boring, bland, uninspired, and copypasted (more or less) throughout the whole game (not to mention I'm convinced at this point that a lot of these indie dash platformers, duck souls, mastho is together, and this, are using some sort of template, but where those other games have their own distinct styles of level design and are generally pretty varied and interesting, saomi just drops the ball and kind of just does the same stuff over and over. makes me feel like the dev doesn't care about the quality of the game and is just churning it out for a quick buck, which wouldn't be a far-fetched assumption given that I'm convinced this is based on some sort of template, granted it has more momentum-y player physics and a double jump whereas the other games I've seen in this template don't which should make this game theoretically more interesting than those other ones but it just fails at being very interesting). The game also has no rebindable controls, some awkward default (required) keyboard controls, and some... strange... stuff going on in the resolution section of the options to say the least.

TL;DR
So really I would say if you're a heavy enjoyer of the genre you should still be able to have fun with this game but the level design is very uninspired and copypasty and I couldn't really recommend it to people who aren't heavy into the genre. Not to mention it's actually decently challenging as well which is another thing that makes it more recommendable to veterans rather than people who don't play these that much. Probably best played as a speedrun game.",1,0

"Okay. This game just came out, so I'm going to try really hard not to dog on it. I will share my specific thoughts on changes with the devs directly, so this is just a general overview for anyone who is considering a purchase.

I'll start with the only serious problem I have with the game. Unfortunately, this one is (partially) out of the devs' control. 
There are no players. And when I say ""no players"", I almost literally mean NO players. It takes ages to load into a battle royale match, and the entire lobby will still be only bots. I hate focusing on this issue because it's basically unfixable with an update. Starting out with a low player count means a TON of work has to be done (advertising, content drops, etc) to get new players into the game, but those same players are going to quit after they have no real opponents. 
This would be less of an issue if the bots were fun to fight against, but unfortunately they are not. I found myself getting solo squad wipes in some matches and getting steamrolled by a single bot in others. Along with a difficulty tweak, the bot spawning system needs to be COMPLETELY reworked. You will regularly see squads of bots just spawn into existence randomly, sometimes even behind you. Ignoring the bots, there is a great foundation here for the BR mode (although a ton of the aspects are obviously ripped off from Apex Legends), but the current saving grace for this game is the CO-OP mode.

The CO-OP mode has some (relatively) small issues that need fixing, but is overall a great time with some friends. It seems to be HEAVILY based off another game called ""Gunfire Reborn"". Say what you want about creativity, but it's fun. The positive review I am giving this game is almost solely based on my experience in PVE.

Now. Moving forward. Unless something drastic changes, I don't think the BR mode for this game will survive. My suggestion for the devs is this: make the BR mode FREE. To have any hope of competing with games like POP1, there needs to be easy access to at least get people into the game. There is already a fully competent item-shop style cosmetic monetization strategy implemented, why not use that instead? If you make the ""base game"" free and lock the PVE mode behind a paid DLC, you can benefit from the larger install base, especially on devices like the Quest. I assume you are already contacting some VR content creators to showcase the game. There are some cool mechanics in here, and I think with some polishing a lot of people would love to give it a try if they are exposed to it.",0,1

"The Sadako rising chapter is a licensed chapter, with a new killer and survivor, but no new map. The Onryo, or as a lot of people I know call her; ""The Ring Girl"" is the featured killer of the chapter. Her ability is to phase in and out of reality, turning invisible like The Wraith, but lacking the speed, and removing her collision against survivors, so you can't body-block anyone. While demanifested, she can teleport to one of several TVs spread around the map, allowing for nice mobility and gen control, since they tend to spawn near generators. As an added bonus, teleporting near a survivor adds her exclusive condemn status, allowing a free mori if you get this status high enough. This all sounds really powerful, and can be with the right addons and strategy, but it takes a lot of effort to really make her work. TVs take 2 minutes to reactivate on use, and condemned can easily be removed by a survivor grabbing an item from a TV and bringing it to a different TV. The incredible ease of counterplay, and lack of utility in her primary ability makes her a really hard sell, but if you dedicate to playing with condemn builds, she can be powerful, it just takes a lot of effort, and kills any build variety she could have.

Her perks however are a different story. Her 3 new perks; Floods of Rage, Call of Brine, and Merciless Storm, are all really good. Floods of Rage is a scourge hook ability, revealing everyone's aura to you when a survivor is saved off of a hook. Not necessarily worth bringing by itself, but if you're running another scourge hook ability alongside it, it can be a wicked info perk. Call of Brine is currently a meta perk, and chances are you've seen it more times than you can count. Upon kicking a generator, it regresses twice as fast, and gets highlighted in yellow. If a survivor gets back on, any great skill check they hit will send you a loud noise notification. Great info, and crazy slowdown, there's a reason everyone runs this one. Lastly, Merciless Storm. This one send a relentless barrage of skill checks in the last 10 seconds of the generator, and failing one of them will block it, leaving it to regress for awhile, and showing you exactly where it is. This loses effectiveness the longer you play, since experienced survivors can hit skill checks without problems, but it can catch inexperienced players off guard, and with the right build, (or playing doctor) you can make this barrage last a ridiculously long time, or make it impossible to hit them all without a crazy amount of focus and timing. All three of these are awesome, and across all of my killer builds, they're all present more than once, which is rare in a lot of killers.

Yoichi on the other hand, is not so great. He lacks any stealth, wearing a big yellow coat and being pretty loud, and his perks are all pretty terrible, to the point that I tend to forget what they even do. Parental Guidance hides scratches when you stun the killer, which could work in a killer stun build maybe, but chances are the killer will be able to see you after the stun anyways, and regardless, there are so many more better stealth perks. Empathetic Connection lets injured survivors see you and lets you heal faster, which isn't terrible, but once again, perks like Bond and Botany Knowledge do these jobs better. Worst of all, Dark theory, is a boon totem that makes you 3% faster when you're inside it. Maybe if like all 4 of your perks are boon perks, and you happen to have a bunch of objectives inside the boon radius, maybe it could be nice, but I never see it get used, and even when I do, it's never made any difference. The radius isn't even close to making it worth it, and with the time and effort to put up and maintain boon totems while keeping them in relevant parts of the map, its more time wasted in setup than it saves in chase. Its sad that a cool spin on the original character is such a waste in practice.

Overall, if you wanna maximise your bang for you buck, and don't want to buy everyone, buying Sadako with auric cells, or just getting her perks in the shrine is probably the way to go. Yoichi is only worth it if you're trying to get every character, and Sadako as a killer is pretty lacking compared to everyone else.",1,0
It seems cool and the game could be so fun if it was just designed with any thought. You should not get attacked while locked into a startup animation of a passive effect that changes the camera angle and prevents movement. You should also not power attack a boss only for it to go into a powerful attack **before hitting the fucking ground**. The most important part of soulslike combat is that it be hard **but fair**. I didn't get past the first boss before any excitement for the game was gone,1,0

All of the characters speak with Text-To-Speech, the script is sometimes marred by broken English and there were a few bugs.

"Again a lovely theme, interesting gameplay and beautiful asthetics. Like always with Sokpop.

But also, again, plain horrible UI and control mechanics. I am unsure if the people at Sokpop are superhumans or use different input devices than humans but this game is unplayable.

- No shortcuts for the building menu. I have to click on every very little icon AND also return from every menu with the back arrow, which is more close to the middle of the screen
- When placing a building or picking up resources I cannot click the location. I have to walk there and keep the mouse button pressed while doing so. However during that the camera moves and my cursor position changes as the camera is always centered on the player character. The result is that you constantly miss where you wanted to build or gather.

If that gets reworked the game has potential. But atm it is unplayable.

Eagerly waiting for an update and looking forward to change my review then.

[h1]An infinite runner that needs improvements[/h1]
[b]Endless Fucker[/b] is a 3D infinite runner similar in essence to most games of the genre but with a few twists that make it stand on its own—and no, you don't bang people while you're running.

You're dropped in the middle of the biome of your choice—plains being the only available one at first, with the other 4 being unlocked as you progress—and then you try to get as far as possible while avoiding obstacles, sliding under tunnels, picking up gems to unlock new characters and poses, and visiting new biomes through secret portals. Moreover, it comes with 4 different difficulties you can pick, with hardcore being the hardest and most entertaining. All the sweet sexy action is reserved for the gallery in which you pick the scenario, any of the available girls, a sex position of your choosing, and then have all the fun you want. It's a bit basic, but some may find it serviceable.

However, the game has a bunch of issues ranging from odd but ultimately harmless graphical bugs to gameplay-related problems in Hardcore difficulty. For instance, it sometimes places you right in the middle of the water at the start, with little to no chance of jumping far enough to get back on track. Also, you may find unavoidable obstacles at times, such as a tree in the middle of the only place you can run through. Moreover, your character's limbs move in an unnatural way whenever you crash into something, to the point they look like anything but a human person once they are on the floor.

[h1]Verdict: It could be better[/h1]
I wish I could give this game a neutral review because it's entertaining despite all its issues, but the bugs are too serious to overlook—the huge amount of space it takes on your HDD and long loading times don't help either. I suggest you wait for updates before purchasing it because it could be a worthwhile game to play when you have a few spare minutes once its issues are fixed.",1,0

"So,

This game by far is the definition of early access. Unpolished movement, missing interfaces, and overall definitely was not release ready by any way shape or form.

The devs even pulled it for another week because they ""were not happy"" with the product that they released. If that's the case, then I dont know how they were happy with this version of it either.


With that being said, i think this game has great potential, and that if you buy it now, you are not buying to dive deep into a game as of yet, you are buying to support the developer so they can continue to work on the game and improve it to what we are expecting to see.

The game gives off an old school early 2000's vibe that i enjoy and brings back some memories, and the general schematic they have laid out seem to be something that could produce quite an interesting game.

As of now, i give overall 5.5/10 at the current stage.",0,1

"Okay, this DLC gets a ton of hate. But it's undeserved. It's something innovative that has absolutely no explanation behind it. This may turn some people off from the DLC, but this gets far too much hate than it deserves. And honestly, the reviews put me off buying this but when I did, I was pleasantly surprised.

Most of the 'bugs' people report, are simply not understanding the design. Let's go for the plane designer, since that's really what shines about this DLC. A large amount of complaints are about air-wings not reinforcing each other. This is because you have to have the same load out for a plane if you want to upgrade it to something else. That means if you make a multi-role fighter (which yes you can), you have to put a CAS attachment on it, and fighter weapons. I have personally made high-speed interceptors, multi-role fighters, heavy fighters, heavy, small, and medium naval bombers, high-range recon planes, light and heavy strategic bombers that can literally flatten a country, light and heavy CAS (sounds weird right?) and tactical bombers that are versatile. I also was able to customize each carrier for a specialized load out to their theater. This has all been from my one game. A common complaint was 'you can't make planes outside of the typical design' and this isn't true. You can. You just have to make sure it sticks to the same load out. So I suggest training air as soon as possible to get your different types of planes, to get production going as soon as possible.

 The point is, it's really up to your imagination in what you make. You just have to make sure you know the system first, i.e. have the same load out for a plane if you want to upgrade it. If you don't, you can simply make a new production line (which is far more realistic than just sticking to 1 plane, especially for a big nation like USA which has the ability to make many types of planes). And the fact that there is now a front manager for planes, makes it so much easier to level up planes, and place them elsewhere.

Most hoi 4 DLC's I haven't restarted for days to learn. This one I did. The Tank Designer, it's really about maxing your armor, and other stats. My tanks rarely fluctuate. But my planes have too. You have to balance production cost, with need in the air, and you have to keep track of how your planes do. I had to switch my naval bombers from range to armor because they kept getting shot down. 

But, there's still limitations. You can't max out a fighter for max air attack and defense, because it will make it slow and bad in the field. Interceptors are limited to only fighter weapons, even if you press them to a different equipment tag, you still can only have one type if you focus on fighter weapons. You can't choose the best option every time either because it would effect the agility of your plane. The DLC is really meant for nations with a huge economy to mess around in, so for smaller nation players, I can see your frustration. 

Someone also complained here that they spent along time researching strategic bombers to bomb ports. This is also unnecessary. Tactical bombers can and always have been able to strategically bomb, and if you make a light strategic bomber, or LSB, you can easily replace your heavy bomber fleet for the time you need to produce those planes. 

Perhaps people appreciate more land stuff. I have no idea. I am pleasantly surprised at this DLC and I hope Paradox continues in it's path that they're on right now. The designers are innovative and fun, and add a lot of extra detail to the game. The other stuff? Who has ever cared about focus trees. It's like saying the best thing about pizza is the crust. And border gore. 

I would highly recommend this DLC and paradox if you see this, do not become Bethesda and hate your playerbase because of bad reviews. Perhaps introduce a tutorial to explain the air designer system, as it's not explained whatsoever. And most people who aren't me don't have days to learn it.",0,1

"The developer is a great storyteller. You wish the games to last longer.

-Tartarus Engine has the best atmosphere and storytelling. Unfortunately game is very short and there is little interaction.

-Concrete Tremor is good but I wish the game just let me look around to pick up the phone or open the drawer. Scripted camera movements are not my thing. These games have great atmosphere. Freedom of look should be priority.

-The Other Side has a very engaging game play. I felt like pit stop. Was a very enjoyable experience. Story was nice.

-Alpha Control Room: This one was just meh. Weakest game among all. Game is too short. I couldn't actually enjoy this one. 

-Carbon Steel: Now, this is a game. Too bad it was too short? You give us a lot of mechanics. And introduce a new one each day. This game is about a research stations where you spend 3 days and do tasks each day. But game should've lasted 4 or 5 days. After I master all the disks and mechanics, game should have allowed me with one more day to let me have maximum fun. The plot was weak but atmosphere, level design and storytelling was cool.

My complaint is mostly about games being too short or just not letting me be free. This was a big problem with Concrete Tremor or Tartarus Engine. Both game stands out with atmosphere. Yet you can't enjoy it enough. Give player more movement and looking around freedom. Games with good atmosphere always takes strength from freedom of walking around or just exploring stuff.

It would be nice if Mike Klubnika (developer) put some secrets in games. Like don't block access to every place. Would be nice if there were some details. It doesn't have to be a big secret. Just a room that player can enter that is not about linear story. Just one room. One detail. Rewarding exploration with an interesting detail. That would make Klubnika games more powerful and perfect them.

I don't play horror games, only watch them. However with excellent storytelling and atmosphere design, Mike Klubnika games deserves at least 1 run. The atmosphere and small yet interesting plot in Tartarus Engine was simply jaw dropping.

I hope developer will make at least 1 or 2 hours long game next time, with some more details, freedom, game play elements... Because you can never have enough of this atmosphere.

8/10 overall collection. You will spend 80 to 120 minutes completing entire collection. And it is all for free. If Turkish lira wasn't so weak against USD, I would go and support the developer. Take my apologies, I would really like to donate on itch.io.",0,1

"EDIT: Honestly I now strongly dislike this game. All the units are extremely samey, cards are weak, arty never gets overrun so adds no depth, losing units doesn't change your composition significantly. The attacker/defender aspect is the only interesting part of the game, since as defender you repeatedly (since it is a long game) have to retreat to avoid encirclement but doing so means losing entrenchment bonus. But I leave the positive review up since some people liked it. and I don't want to invalidate their opinion.

------------------------------------------------------

I have only played this series for 5 hours. Some of that was reading the manual, but I already feel like I know almost everything so it is an easy to learn game.

Biggest new changes are:

- A new recon and LoS system, which adds a lot, but can be the most complicated part of the game.
- Better UI, editors and modding support. It's not Wesnoth but it'll do.
- Ability to create your own formations. Not sure if AI uses it. Seems quite powerful, for example you could split off all artillery, then they can fire every turn without slowing their infantry (but can be attacked alone).
- A new optional RNG system, if you want battles to be decided in 4 dice rolls instead of 100s, thus having a much wider bell curve. Ideally chaos should be built into the battle system, but this could do.
- Removal of RPG decisions due to smaller scale. You will not be tried for warcrimes or throw a military coup against Hitler.

Now on to comparison with other games. Having not played Grigsby's games, it seems that here you lose much of the air war, command, and supply mechanics. But you gain the ability to actually understand EXACTLY how combat works. For me, that is a very good tradeoff.

But Wesnoth compares pretty well. Why play this premium completed single-scenario game when there already exists a free game with absurd amounts of scenarios and entirely different gamemodes hidden in the mods? The answer lies almost exclusively in the combat calculations:

- There are like 20 modifiers displayed when you make an attack, clearly communicated, that make for complex reasons that your attack might not work well. Besides terrain and time of day, Wesnoth really has none, even in mods, due to the UI not really supporting it.
- Multi-tile ranged attacks exist, and have a suppression effect, making for neat choices. Though tbf, like a lot of things, Wesnoth does not do this because they struggle to make a good AI for it. It's too early to evaluate this game's AI.
- Due to the fact that counters consists of hundreds of units instead of just 1, there is some screening effect. That is to say, if you have 100 infantry and 1 tank, your tank is very unlikely to be hit. There's also a related mechanic where infantry deal much less damage in the first 2 rounds, tanks slightly less, and artillery deal full damage and can't even be attacked until later rounds. But one could argue that Wesnoth's 1UPT form of screening based on ZoC and bodyblocking might be more strategic, though that also means it's harder for the AI lol
- Due to the fact that counters consists of hundreds of units instead of just 1, it is possible for your unit to be damaged in a way that alters its composition, making it, in Wesnoth terms, a completely different unit. Fuel and ammo may also cause this. I don't know how common it is.
- Outside of combat, there is a cards system, where you randomly acquire the ability to pay the auto-generated political points for onetime benefits such as new units or airstrikes. It seems a nice way to add variability and make for strategy that feels more coordinated, not a focus though, and again who knows how the AI uses it.
- It's got a supply mechanic of course, and you can play as a vastly outnumbered defensive army that must balance entrenching and retreating (to some degree you must retreat due to supply), something you can't often do in Wesnoth.

I find the character and environment design here to be lacking compared to the previous games of this game series. Also, I find the animated scene looked very weird and unsatisfying. Especially, in the opening scene where Stacy was taking a video when she noticed something that she have to looked at the place. I can't help but notice the unnatural look and movement she did. Sadly, I am still having problem with the system lag and audio in this game as well(¬_¬"")
Although, there were a lot of things that I find disappointing, I do like the scenery visuals about the ""past storytelling"" in the game about Victor and Emily's past. 

[h2]My thoughts on the Story[/h2]
(∩⌣̀_⌣́)Story....I think that the story could have been very interesting if the antagonist was created with care. [spoiler] I find the antagonist in this game very lacking in motivation and the ending to be quite unsatisfying. I just hope there was much more shown on why Abigail, Emily's supposed sister (because there was not much of an interaction), is the antagonist. In a small town set in small place I am not sure why Abigail would have the outrageous idea that Victor is supposed to marry her. I have the same feeling as when Emily was pushed of the cliff. I am glad that Victor and Emily was alive but the problem with them being subjected to people's hatred was not resolved. Anna and Stacy would go back to the present so they have no problem but Victor and Emily will stay in the past where the people feared and hunted them. I am not quite sure that people will be that welcoming of them even when Victor saved the town[/spoiler] The developer should have shown the story dynamics between the three character even if it is not written in the narrative, putting Abigail in the picture with an antagonistic look could have been a good foreshadowing. There was just too little information and interaction between Abigail, Victor and Emily. The purpose in the bonus game is just as weak with not much depth (๑ᵕ⌓ᵕ̤) well people can just say the antagonist was such a shallow person. If you reduce the redundant -same old repetitive- puzzle solving then you will find that there is nothing much going on in the story.

I therefore conclude that this game is not for veteran HOP gamers. If you are new to the genre then maybe you should try and play this game.",0,1
"The main menu GUI does not scale to my desktop resolution. I have to manually move it to exit. And the ""all seeing eye"" add on auto-mapping program usually crashes, even when I play on windowed 720p and try to shift this application on the screen. When the mapping utility DOES work,  it does not scale to my desktop so I only see part of it.  In fact, I can drop the main game resolution to almost nothing, and the auto mapper still does not really work. So, after all these years. It does not work "" out of the box"" for me.  How is this possible???
I get the sense that the publisher of this ancient game series simply assumed that everyone plays at really high resolutions, and I do not. But if you cannot get a 1360 x 768 desktop to function well, you are a publisher who really phoned it in. 
PS every other game I own, you know, good games that demand a lot of my system, do not do this. 
Poorly tested. Thank goodness I did not buy any other of the products they released.
PS when I search for this publisher on VG Insights, it seems that they are a pretty new indie publisher with a median income of $ 1260 per game. I suspect the issue I raise may never be fixed. And that is sad. This really was a fun old series in its day.
Correction. They actually DID fix the mapping issue. Wow. Good stuff!",0,1

"[h3]The Good[/h3]
+ 1 new heroine that I like to class as a dancing tornado of death when she does her ultimate attack. She spins around firing dual revolvers like sub machine guns and seemingly headshotting common zombies with ease and I love her all the more for it.
+ Great for farming cash because in 4/5 of the missions you can obtain 250k+ per mission just on normal difficulty. 
+ 9 new ""ult"" skills to buy after reaching their criteria which gives you a buff for the price of a debuff, such as your allies never dying in exchange for you taking double damage. You can take only one of these new skills one at a time though.
+ A ridiculously overpowered body pillow weapon. While it does cover half of your vision when held which sucks, using its secondary fire to throw it like a boomerang is a better crowd control than a molotov cocktail, insta-killing anything through walls including some special zombies when it touches them.

[h3]The Bad[/h3]
- The performance issues. There are [i]a lot[/i] more zombies that spawn in compared to the base game campaign so expect the frame rate to drop frequently because the game can't manage the huge groups of zombies, even with a high performance CPU.
- Quite a number of visual bugs, glitches and unfinished level design in some parts where you can walk through objects. There's also invisible walls where there shouldn't be and where you should be able to walk (i.e over a small pile of rubble). 
- Some parts look as if the developer published the DLC during the level design phase. You can see level design blocks and red cones indicating enemy positions coming out of zombies.
- [spoiler]The tank controls in DLC mission 3 are garbage. The tank skids on the floor when you do a simple turn and the turret aiming is stuck with inverted controls without any option to change it. And whenever it hits a group of zombies with its sides then you'll tip sideways then upside down.[/spoiler]
- Bugged achievements.
- One of the most annoying and awfully designed final boss fights that doesn't even recognise it was damaged in its weak spot half of the time, and winning via a tug-of-war mechanic.

I would give this a thumbs up but it's a broken mess with game breaking bugs, glitches and performance issues. The direction is there for a fun DLC but the negatives listed above ruin the experience completely. So avoid or wait a while for the developer to do patches if they care enough since they didn't fix problems in the base game before the DLC was released.",1,0

"Unfortunately, the gameplay itself leaves much to be desired. Although the concept seems intriguing, the execution falls short. The mechanics are repetitive and lack depth, ultimately resulting in a monotonous experience. The tasks involved are simplistic and rarely offer any variety or challenge. This quickly leads to boredom and diminishes the enjoyment of the game.",0,1
"This is a clear case where Steam is lacking the sideways thumb option. 

Game idea (as far as I can tell):
- You have a dungeon with girls to train (I never made it past 1 girls so far and always got stuck - more about this below under ""Cons"").
- Per day you can chose 3 Actions (3 AP = 3 activities). Your girls start with some HP and Mana. HP is needed for actions (training, alchemy or orgies) and Mana improves what you get out of Alchemy (?) 
- You can chose to ""train"" (= improve some statistic) or do ""Alchemy"" (=get some random item, like equipment or health portion, etc). ""trainings"" and ""Alchemy"" cost HP, so you may not be able to execute 3 actions depending on the choices.
- At the end of the 3 actions, there is an Orgy that you can have your girl(s) engage in if HP are left over.

Pros:
- The game idea and concept is good and funny
- It is fairly easy to understand

Cons:
- The implementation is bad: bad performance, bad breast dynamics, mediocre animations.
- You can get stuck quite easily, there are some bugs. 
- Bug 1:  a new day should start with full HP. That is not always the case. If you start the day with 0 HP and have no healing portion in your inventory, the game is stuck - you cannot do any tasks and that is it.
- Bug 2: Some potions (HP or Mana) exceed your maximum values for HP or Mana. You consume these potions and sometimes it gives you the value of the potion and in other times the maximum HP / mana value. I could live with either, but it should be consistent to make sense.
- In short: there are many bugs. The game doesn't behave at all as indicated in the screenshots or in the short movie clip.",1,0

"[b]This ""prologue"" feels like a demo of a beta release[/b]

[h3]Pros[/h3] 
[olist]
[*]The story so far seems interesting, nothing too groundbreaking and a bit too similar to Half-Life
[*]Visually, the game looks quite good and runs well, I never dipped below 150 fps (for my pc this is unusual)
[*]The puzzles are simple to understand but satisfying to figure out
[*]I personally really like the energy manipulator as a puzzle solving device
[/olist]

[h3]Cons[/h3] 
[olist]
[*]Unlike what the description on steam says ""a pair of gameplay hours"", this prologue takes less than 1 hour to complete even if you stop to read everything
[*]The Valve inspirations are too on the nose, everything from the story all the way to game mechanics and even the loading screen can be compared to Half-Life or Portal, which in my opinion, deprives this game from its own identity
[*][b]The voice-acting and the script is absolutely horrendous[/b] which is a shame because theres a lot of it (this is my biggest complaint about this game)
[*]The game stops you a few times to listen to dialogue and dump exposition which completely kills the flow and reminds you of how terrible the VA is
[*]The trailer in this steam page spoils almost all of the puzzles in the prologue (seriosuly, dont watch the trailer)
[*]The movement speed is frustratingly slow, crouching makes you extremely slow and sometimes you're forced to crouch to fit into vents
[*]Walking around industrial looking buildings gets boring very quickly, in a game about travelling between dimensions this feels like a huge waste
[*]I encountered a lot of bugs, although none of them were game-breaking, they were almost always annoying [spoiler]like using the green energy to stop the door from slamming but no matter how high I stopped it, I couldnt pass without wiggling myself and jumping while crouched[/spoiler]
[*]Stacking objects to climb somewhere is very frustrating because objects are very easy to be knocked away and jumping is very clunky
[/olist]

I forgot this was a prologue while playing and fully expected to have a prompt at the end of the game telling me this was a beta release and to submit bugs and feedback, which is what made me write this review.

This game has a ton of potential and I ask you to play this prologue yourself since its free and entertaining, to create your own opinions, but if the full game releases like this, I cannot recommend it",1,0

"I currently do not recommend playing this game, as it is mostly unplayable due to the following reasons: 
- The menu feels unintuitive to use and lacks feedback when clicking buttons.
- Performance is not great, turning on Lumen takes the game to about 15 fps (using an RTX 3060 ti) and the overall FPS is not great.
- It is difficult to play with friends because the ""friends"" tab seems to work only half of the time and the active lobby list takes way too much time to load. 
- Driving works pretty well, until you fall over and have no way to get up again.

I do however see potential for this game to become one of the goofy racing games of all time, so I hope the dev keeps working on it. Therefore I recommend others to try the game and give their own feedback.",0,1

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Mellowollem is for lack of a better way to put it a tech demo.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Game play is extremely primitive. WASD or Arrow keys to move, Z to interact, and Space to advance the conversation. None of these keys can be remapped. You start off in what looks to be a hospital corridor. You can't open any of the doors. When you walk to the far door the scene changes. You see a woman on a beach. You walk up and talk to her, then you have to walk around the map and pick up watermelons, no reason, just pick up watermelons. You bounce back between a room with bunkbeds, the hospital corridor, and areas with the woman. There is no direction, just keep trying to activate things and when you get the right object(s) you advance. There is a hide and seek game where you have to find the woman. There is also a cat, but no explanation of why.

There is a small story you discover along the way.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
This plays like an assignment in a programming class. Create a game where the player picks up objects and plays hide and seek.

Intel i7-8086K Coffee Lake 6-Core 4.00GHz CPU
Crucial Ballistix Sport AT 2666 MHz DDR4 RAM (16GB x 2)
ASUS GeForce RTX 2080 Overclocked 8G GDDR6

"AOTPR is a fairly recent game, and it was originally designed for the Commodore PET as an experiment to see if a fun action/puzzle arcade game could be written for the PET. Along the way, he kept adding systems... Currently, the game runs on DOS, Super Nintendo, Commodore PET, VIC-20, 64, 128, Sega Genesis, Commodore Amiga, and Apple II. It's also unofficially supported on a few other platforms, and several ports are in progress. 

It's amazing how a game written for a 32K 8-bit computer has been ported to so many different systems and is fun to play on all of them. 

So what is AOTPR? 

Despite the appearance, this is not an action game. It's a puzzle game: you are supposed to use time bombs, EMP bombs, magnets, and environmental objects to manipulate and destroy a swarm of malfunctioning robots. Once all the robots are eliminated, the level ends.

The game is simple in concept, but there's a lot to do in practice... find hidden items, discover strategies for dealing with each robot, and then try different strategies on different maps.

I own this game on several platforms now, and I think the DOS port is among the best - along with the Amiga and Genesis versions. If you like retro computing, this is a great game to play on your PC and on your vintage computers.",0,1

"I think that this visual novel (without any choices) is rather for women and maybe for cuckolds. Honestly, I am no judge of that. It is not my cup of tea. Without rushing it is about 1h long. It should be at least 3 times longer! It is not bad, but it is not very good either. The graphics is nice and the novel has some potential, but it stops where it starts to get interesting.

"Short as hell, clocking in on lil over 2 hours, but that is like nearly 2 hours of staring at the screen waiting for Relationship to hit 100% for the story to continue.
If you ever owned a Tamagotchi, you already know how to play the game.

The cooking in the game is so borked (not as in broken) that you're better off only making the Pan Fried Steak, cause the others are just not worth the existential crisis you'll get trying to 3 star em.

Do night shift like 5 times, and now you got more money than you'll spend, making the Job section of the game, pretty pointless, just left hand on Left, Down and Right key, and the right hand on the mouse to pick up the other ingredients that is not designated to Left and Right, and then click on the plate of the person who wants it, you'll earn over 2,000 for a 1 min night shift.

My only real gripe with the game (outside of there barely being anything to warrants your immediate attention) is the battle at the end, the timing is such BS, you need to be on fkn point, and the window is smaller than the thickness of your average finger.
I only beat it within 10 tries cause it bugged out and did it's big move 3 times in a row with allows you to retaliate.

And when you do beat the game...don't quit, just, let it play for a while, enjoy the music while you do.


Over all, 7/10.
It's a cute game to chill (or fap) to and it's cheap, so might aswell go for it if you got nothing better to do.

"If you enjoy watching classic sci-fi b-movies you might well enjoy 'Invaders from another dimension'. This indie shooter puts you into the action with no guns across 3 levels. Starting off in some sort of hub you choose 1 of 3 levels and they shoot anything and everything that moves. And yes, that really is all there is to the game. There is a small amount of story about getting a nuclear bomb to the other side of the level, but that is about it. It's just a low-poly, small-price action shooter with no score, no way to return to the main menu and no options whatsoever. For a £2.09 I can see someone enjoying this, but if ""meh"" was a game, this is what it would look like. For the price its worth a look, but it would have been better off being a freebie.

"[h1]This game is not ready yet but...[/h1]

[u][b]TLDR:[/b][/u]
... when it is it will be really good. When its finished I foresee a really nice game that scratches some of my automation/magic/shop itches. Be warned, you will get about [b]4 hours max[/b] of good play time at present before you start to see the end of things like dialogue and crafting abilities. I feel like I've been ripped off in a way. There's no way this game has reached the stage of being what I class as ""early access"". At best it's a very early demo. So whilst being miffed that they've released it in this state and I've basically paid for a demo, what I can say is in time and with lots and lots more content and additions this game could be great.

[u][b]Game play:[/b][/u]
The mechanics themselves aren't all that unique or unfamiliar. What is new is a nice blending of genres of automation, meets shop, meets resource farming and production queues. 

The grinding and collecting of resources is the same as most games of this type. The unique power function like blinking for a wizard class is fun, but the recharge time is annoying. 

At present a lot of the areas are blocked off and a few times I've managed to find my way into areas which haven't been unblocked yet, due to a bugs in the game. This meant I was automatically knocked unconscious or got stuck and had to try and blink my way out of things. The game is very buggy still...

It has a sort of fable 1 aesthetic which really works for someone like me. The graphic style also reminds me of old school World of Warcraft which isn't unwelcome either. I thought is was nice. Perhaps it needs some more polishing. The text and the UI need a lot of work, they're very basic but yeah I like it.

[u][b]Story:[/b][/u]
What they really need to do is get the dialogue and story right. At the minute you can see how their progress with the dialogue is minimal because it literally ends all of a sudden and it felt very abrupt. A really good immersive story is a must for games like this and it is something games often overlook. For example ""Stardew Valley"" is one of the best games I've ever played, but it would have been improved immensely if ConcernedApe had really fleshed out a strong, long immersive storyline. If you can deliver that, you'll have an amazing game here.

[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]
They really need to work on the music, its a bit lacklustre for me at the minute. I can't say anything else about it, its not bad, but its definitely not good either.

[u][b]Suggestions for improvement: [/b][/u]
[list]
[*]Trees aren't growing fast enough. I cant harvest wood to make bottles. That needs to be looked at in terms of balance. Same for the speed plants in the poison forest. 
[*]there's no option to import wood, which adds to the problem above
[*]You need some kind of journal which notes down which heros liek which potions. At the minute it's hard to remember and pot luck basically
[*]The map needs a lot of work, there's no live YOU ARE  HERE marker which is annoying...
[*]Gear! Give us the ability to level up and spec our gear. Perhaps branch out into crafting and enchantment as well as potions, that would be awesome!
[*]include a fighting system similar to that of ""Sun Haven"" or ""Stardew Valley"". Add dungeons
[*]expand production beyond potions; include magic items etc. (Think ""Factorio"")
[*]add progression mechanics to the game. Something that would have taken hours to do at the beginning takes seconds because you have unlocked something (Tech Tree) or you've bought something (Economy Tree)
[*]employ writers and put shed loads of story and narrative into the game. Folks love a reason to do stuff, a good story is one of them
[*]add better NPCs and marriage and family abilities
[*]include the ability to upgrade, decorate or change the shop
[*]add farming mechanics to the game so you can grow your own ingredients",1,0

[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Nun and Light's Unreachable Forest is an erotic casual turn-based RPG that looks to create an immersive roleplaying experience surrounding one Nun's journey into a dark and corrupted forest in search of peace.

    [td]🟩 The general plot foundation is solid, but unfortunately, the execution simply isn't there.

    [td]🟥 While I believe the story holds some merit, the English translations and grammatical errors destroy any semblance of plot flow.

🟥The combat is turn-based, which suits a game of this genre and style. It does force you to grind levels before progressing, which becomes tedious as your female companion becomes useless for 80% of the fight, and there's no particular way to prevent that.

🟥 Boss fights are a genuine slog, where if you want to attain the best outcome, you will spend a lot of time grinding levels and money to achieve it.[/td]

[h1]Story[/h1]
These once peaceful lands have been far less safe to travel since the demihumans of the forest have started to leave the confines of the wood. They have been killing men and children, and women are being kidnapped and taken away for breeding. The humans have decided to take this no longer and are resigned to destroying the demihuman nest and killing all they come across to restore peace.

But one chaste Nun named Hitori, assigned to protect the village closest to the corrupted forest, wishes to seek a passive way to ensure peace rather than resorting to violence. 

You play as Razu (by default, you can change the name), a young warrior who rises to the occasion to protect Hitori as she decides to enter the forest to broker for the peace she longs for.

The plot isn't terrible, and I like the idea of protecting a fair maiden on her noble quest. But this is where the issues accumulate as the sheer volume of grammatical and spelling errors within the first 15 minutes alone is staggering beyond count. Couple this with the poor translation quality, and the overall story flow and direction are squandered before the game starts.

[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]
[h3]Simplistic tedium at its finest.[/h3]
I don't want this to be negatively focused, as the game is mechanically sound and does provide a modicum of fun. But there is something to say about how simplistic it is, to the point where it's almost borderline pointless to implement the combat. Enemies seemingly take 1-3 turns to kill on average, as your partner becomes incapable of attacking for about 80% of every fight, you have a small reserve of mana that you can use to do special attacks, and this replenishes upon reaching your tent, which serves as a base, or by levelling up which happens frequently.

Bosses are entirely separate entities, as they don't seem to do any damage to you but have large pools of health, which makes them tedious to encounter, especially with the constant e-scenes that repeatedly appear on screen for every attack round.

You can equip new armour and weapons you can buy from the town to improve your damage and survivability. They aren't expensive and can give you a significant edge in combat.

[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]
As I mentioned earlier, the visuals and animations are high quality. The drawings are unique and artistic without being overly vulgar, and the general animations are pleasant and provide some time to enjoy the situations you find yourself in.

The same can't be said for the audio, as the general soundtrack is bland and unimaginative, providing little to no ambient association with the environments or situations you find yourself in.

[h1]PC Performance and Specifications[/h1]
The game's default is to run on a small windowed screen, which seems to benefit the title as setting it to full screen stretches everything rather than upscaling the resolution. Apart from grammar concerns I didn't encounter any bugs while playing this game. 
🟧 The game doesn't seem to support Steam overlay or the ability to take screenshots.
[b]Please note:[/b]
I have removed the performance section that usually sits here due to the limited visual nature of the game, it felt redundant to provide its hardware usage.

[h1]Final Thoughts - Borderline[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]
Nun and Lights Unreachable Forest isn't a terrible game, I believe with a little effort to work on the dialogue, this could be one of the better erotic RPGs on the market as it caters to a casual audience while still providing good quality H-scenes. It's a cheap game, so if you have an itch to play something of this genre or find it on sale sometime, I believe it could be worthwhile, if not right now, eventually with some patches.

"Games like this make me wish Steam had a more nuanced thumb option.

This will be a good game. It's not yet. Wait for it to be on sale in a few months and pick it up then.

The Good:

- Very ""Vampire Survivors"" play style. 
- Unlike VS, strong variety in stats for each character suggest the possibility of radically different play styles.
- Widely varied difficulties and maps.
- Multiple methods of advancement; character-specific, base-specific, level-based and gear-based.

The Bad

- Right now, VS's biggest problem is FZ's biggest problem: ultimately, you're still just walking around a wide open area and letting the game do most everything else. It becomes grindy and repetitive fairly quickly. We don't have the number of options and tweaks we do in Brotato to make up for it. 
- 30 minutes to complete a map; you can (and should) leave early in many cases, but your character will max out before 20 - you'll then spend ten minutes literally doing nothing but walking around in the least-engaging part of VS/FZ's content.
- The balance is VERY, VERY, VERY out of whack. One evolved weapon in particular is STUNNINGLY out of balance with the rest. The tier list would go ""S+++, A, C, F"" right now. It's problematic enough that when you discover it, anything else feels reallllly pale. Now that's forgivable; we're in early access - but holy cow is it bad.

The Ugly:
- The predominant, most-powerful strategies involve the use of lots of AoE; no surprise/shock there. Much bigger surprise/shock: in many cases, your computer will not be able to handle it. Framerate drops will have you taking damage from mobs you never even saw/thought were dead. This isn't a performance issue, either; computers running Starfield or Path of Exile shouldn't be staggering on FZ. Now again, this is an entirely forgivable optimization issue - but it's enough of an issue that one might question the Early Access decision at this point. At the very least, take a page from Soulstone Survivors and offer us a ""turn down effects"" slider - getting nailed by mobs you can't see just sucks.

Like I said though: this WILL be a good game. The only major issue that time won't solve and will need some cleverness about is the ""How to avoid the VS grind"" and the developer clearly has already been thinking about it - just not enough (yet.) 

Give it time. Then pick it up. For now though? Maybe not. There's Early Access, and then there's too-early-access. This is the latter, much as I want it to be the former.",1,0

"This game has such potential but there are a lot of disappointments for me. There's no story, no achievements, no reward for completing a scene. There are 5 things to do: Find a quantity of an item hidden in a scene (like 20 gems or dewdrops), A Hangman puzzle, find pairs of symbols, do a jigsaw (I like how the pieces click into place) and find pieces of 3 items hidden in a scene. You just continuously cycle through these 5 ""games"". The scenes themselves are absolutely gorgeous and the main reason I keep playing. Sometimes the items to find are pretty much ""unfindable"" due to being hidden in a very dark or very light place. Even after using the Hint feature (which recharges quickly and there's no penalty for use) you can't see the item and have to just click where the Hint indicated (the dewdrops come to mind. Impossible). The Hangman puzzles are all from one category so far (Magic Powers) and the ""powers"" are pretty obscure. I like getting the correct word but wish there was a reward for doing so. There is a very light musical score and some nice ambient sounds. I play this game for awhile and close out when it feels tedious, but I keep coming back. Very pretty scenes as I said and finding the hidden items can be fun (until it isn't). Again, there is a lot of potential for this game so I'm recommending it and hoping the Dev's make another with more ""depth"".",0,1

"Welcome to Kowloon offers an enjoyable hour of atmospheric horror. The detail-rich environment and well-placed lighting offers an immersive (and truly creepy) experience. I'd recommend to anyone who's looking for a short and decent scare. 

However, the use of jump scares is excessive and made the game's ""scare factor"" feel ""cheap"" (especially [spoiler]the one at the end[/spoiler]). After the second or third jump scare, you will likely feel what I'm talking about  -- ""Another one?""

In terms of lore/story, you gather a number of clues regarding the strange happenings within the Walled City, but ultimately results in a non-cohesive morsel of a narrative. While the game is short, I can't help but feel more could've been done in this regard. There's so many questions like... [spoiler]What happened to the little girl? What happened to that guys wife  who's been in the tub for 3 days? What about the dog? Why are there skinned bodies everywhere?[/spoiler] If the answer, is the [spoiler]gas leak made everyone crazy which led to everything else[/spoiler] then that just feels rather lacking. While the game is short, I can't help but feel more could've been done. If you enjoy horror for the story/lore (in addition to the horror itself), you will likely find yourself disappointed.

Game play was standard but frustrating. Puzzle solving and condition-based progression was pretty typical for the genre. Though, a bit too basic. Selection options were not clear or finnicky (i.e. you need to position the camera just right in order to interact/pickup something). Speaking of the camera, jitters were severe when moving and looking around at the same time. This last one was frustrating (and I don't even have 3D Motion Sickness). 

Overall, it's a pity Steam doesn't have a ""Recommend If"" option. I'd recommend Welcome to Kowloon to those looking for a decent scare and nothing else. The environment and atmosphere are truly well done. However, as a whole, the game feels tropey, hollow, and lacking. For those looking for a little more, I'd recommend to pass or wait for future releases.

"Found about this from a reddit post and decided to give it a try. My thoughts after about 20 minutes of play:

Really hard to figure out where to go for quests when there's no map, mini map or quest markers. It's Early Access so I assume stuff like that will be added later.

Jumping also feels a bit clunky.

I like the battle system so far.

It's also going to be a bit hard getting used to using the number keys as a ""talk to npc"" and ""pick up quest item"" functions.

Not worth it right now but will see how it develops.",1,0

Sure there's a prestige but its shallow, only giving you bonuses that will advance you a bit (x1.2 multiplier or /1.2 price divider).

There's a bunch of potential though, excited to see where it goes!",0,1

"Cute game, but the complete lack of mouse support (there is no mouselook, you have to use the arrows to turn the camera left and right) makes it unnecessarily difficult to complete the platforming sections. I know this was a student project, but if you want to be taken seriously on Steam you really need to learn how to implement mouse support.

There is not much actual gameplay apart from running around collecting items to unlock the gate to the next area (there are three areas in total). I can only recommend this to people who have a controller, and who want to spend 30 minutes solving platforming puzzles and completing simple fetch quests.",1,0

"There are many parts about Heroes Wanted that I really enjoy, but also many parts that I find very frustrating. 

Behind the cute artwork and the seemingly simple combat system, is a lot of careful strategy that needs to be planned out. I liked how I had to be very careful of every action I took in the game, because early losses can really add up and make the later stages a lot harder. I enjoyed Heroes Wanted's approach towards the deck-builder genre, playing around to see how the different elements could be used. 

There are several things i found rather frustrating 

1. It was hard to learn and understand complex mechanics, and a lot of times I had to discover how things worked through trial and error. For example, the leader and retreat concepts were both things I took quite some time to understand. I would suggest better information in-game or some form of early tutorial 

2. It felt like I got really stuck at the bosses. Maybe the difficulty scaling is a bit too extreme. This is a game that is defintely not for casual gamers, because it gets really frustrating when you are stuck and you need to have some familiarity with the rouge-like deck builder genre. I would recommend that the difficulty scaling gets looked at. I want to enjoy the full game but always end up getting stuck at either stage 2 boss or stage 3 boss, 

3. There are some little UX things too that make it frustrating. I'm a UX designer in tech, and i think one thing the devs could explore is better error prevention. For example, there are a couple of times i forgot I needed to click on the card to collect it to my deck, and just clicked next, because Im in an adrenaline rush and just clicking through. This also doesn't align with UX patterns for other similar Gacha type card collecting games. Usually when you view the card, you automatically have it collected into your deck. Maybe there should be a double-confirmation if the player chooses not to collect a card for their deck.

Overall, I enjoyed the game still! I look forward to playing the full complete game, but I think I will take a break for now because its so frustrating being stuck at the third stage boss",0,1

"This game is, in its current state, problematic to recommend.

the mechanics? Great. The game is generally fun, challenging in exactly the right way (for me).

So the basic game works. It is a round based combat game, with a lot of randomness thrown in. Every run is different, runs can be done, as the developer says within the game, in 60 - 90 minutes. Of course, its likely that you will quickly develop a prefered build, and not getting certain things can be a run breaker (healing is, for me, the big one - health is kept the same through encounters, and well, this means you need healing from somewhere. Certain debuffs make things very challenging (undead - healing is damage, most of everything else (excepting specific cards (abilities) you can gain is unchanged.)

Which brings us to the first problematic thing about the game. Its UI. As soon as you have used an ability that creates status effects you can see what they do if you hover over the affected character with the mouse (often blocking sight of the enemy movement range, which is not a good thing). But you cannot see the effects when you get the card, so you basically need to roughly remember what they are doing - and simply remembering the basics, like: that effect does damage, is not enough. 

Poison and Bleeding are the damage effects I have noticed. One triggers at the start of the affected characters round, and is persistent throughout the entire game, the other triggers at the end of the characters round and reduces by one each turn. Both affect a percentage of the characters max health, though a different one each.

But UI can be fixed. In general, descriptions are missing everywhere. There is a restart button in the menu during a run. It restarts the entire run, and you dont get the exp and stuff you have earned until then if you press it. There is no warning. There is no description what the button does anywhere I have looked.

Thats the sort of thing that annoys, but isnt really problematic, because it is fixable, and this is an early access game. The restart button existing isnt bad, if you have bad luck at the start of the run, requiring to go to the main menu to set everything up again would be annoying, and that button makes that process much faster and smoother.  So I see that, and the other UI problems mostly as children of the early access state, the mechanics work, but the UI is secondary to the game working.

Which brings me to the point where I am not sure if I can truly recomend someone to buy this game.

The game doesnt work. Crashes are a relatively common thing, I managed to date 3 runs without a crash, and in 2 of them I died in the first encounter, because I didnt understand how movement works... In the other I managed to reach the final boss. 

I think the situation is getting better, but its still not good. 

All in all, I would say this is a good game, if the crashes can be fixed. If the UI is improved after that, it transforms into an excellent little game. But I would not buy it in its current state., it crashes to often, which really hurts enjoyement - sometimes crashes soft lock a run (as far as I can determine, the game saves after every encounter), which means you cant access the next encounter (aka the one it crashed in) again after restarting the game. Which means you need to restart the run, and loose out on the main progress you have gained to date.

Good game, bad UI, horrible stability. I would encourage wishlisting, but not buying.

EDIT: The Developer added a confirmation window to the restart run button, which explains the effects. 

This is good, and shows what early access is about - the developer giving us a game thats already fun, but unpolished, and in return getting feedback that both makes the game more fun, but also, and in my opinion more importantly, polishes it.",0,1

Still a very good experience, just less good than the original, so I'd personally recommend that instead.

My biggest issue is the updated graphics are a lot harder to read, visually, so the game looses a lot of clarity, as well as a bit of its charm. The enemies are often very hard to tell apart from eachother (with the sole exception of the spitting grub types, whose design and animation was very much improved). Some of the abilities also felt kind of janky in a way I don't remember having issues with (warlock gargoyle for example).",1,0

"[b] The old demo was better - that's a fact. [/b] 

Stumbled upon the game on itch.io in the PSX graphics section of the ""Haunted PS1 Disc"" collection of horror games, of all the games I liked only this one! I was looking for a game with a creepy, oppressive atmosphere and the same ambient - and that was Lorn's Lure. 

In the old demo the location was big, and it scared you just the same with its gigantism and unexploredness. The game ""threw"" you into that dystopian world and said: ""It's all yours, climb wherever you want.""  Very well served the plot and which you had to find.

In the new demo from a good only new UI, the rest - the unnecessary crap. Added training that only a 2-year old child with autism can not pass, all this training could fit into one line. From a large and scary location turned into a monotonous and small gut of pipes, with scattered on the map crystals.

Return the old map, please...",1,0

"Suppose that you were sitting down at this table. The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your ‘left’? Or the one on your ‘right’? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is ‘correct’ too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute ‘society’ with the ‘Universe’. The correct answer is that ‘It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.’ …Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‘society’… Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all. It’s not that anyone can fulfil this role… Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the ‘losers’. In the case of this table, the ‘eldest’ or the ‘Master of the party’ will take the napkin first… Because everyone ‘respects’ those individuals.",0,1
"Some critical issues worth mentioning:

- Game length was too short for the asking price. Took me around 60 minutes to complete it from start to finish, all content.
- Lots of western-style graffiti on the walls. Graffiti is nearly absent in the photographs that I've seen of Kowloon Walled City.
- Lots of western-style packaging and products. Jarring to see in a game where the setting is essentially early 1990s Hong Kong. Note that there are some setting appropriate products.
- Essentially, from what I found, only western books and magazines. In fact, I don't recall observing any literature that I'd expect to find in the setting.
- Some of the locations felt like they were from the middle-east rather than Kowloon.
- Jump scares are cheap! While the horror wasn't all jump scares, it still relied heavily on them.
- Clocks all have different times. This could be intentional, but based on the other issues it's probably unintentional.

Details are important in a walking simulator, because there's not much else to do but to observe and immerse yourself into the setting! If the base price drops to below $2 I would change my review to recommend.",1,0

"Upon starting the game for the first time i had to go into windowed mode so that i could click the menu buttons at all (this is a problem with scaling on windows, my monitor is at 100% native scaling but the game is being rendered at a lower resolution making it not possible to click the menu buttons without guesswork), i had to press ALT+ENTER on my keyboard in order to go into windowed mode and THEN i could play the game. This is not helped by the fact that the options menu only features a Low Medium High preset for the graphics and no resolution options. 
Also even though i have moderately high end specs the game was spinning up my fans like crazy, no FPS issues to it was above 60 all the time.

The second run of the game there were no scaling issues.

Nitpick but Geyser is spelled Geyser.

I was able to go through all of the content the game has in under 5 minutes, this includes split screen co-op. There is a definite need for more content, only having one map centered around the totem gamemode with just a day/night difference is not enough. 

The cutscenes are unskippable, this gets very annoying when you have to see the characters run into the arena every time you play a match, on top of that there is a 3 second Lets go timer EVERY TIME you see the unskippable cutscenes, making if very infuriating when you want to just get into the game.

The timer is glitched, the timer is actually 1 minute and 2 seconds, it looks like it is 3 minutes however once the counter hits 02:00 the timer starts treating the minutes as seconds and immediately goes to 01:00 > 00:00 and ends the game.

The core gameplay loop is not really appealing as a multiplayer game, players on opposing teams cannot damage eachother and simply have to either stun or avoid eachother as they fight to turn the totem more before the time runs out, if that sounds like a very simple and lackluster gameplay loop is because it is. Not being able to kill other players doesnt make it any better, i think the gameplay would very much benefit from players being able to kill eachother, and more purpose being given to each class as well as adding in more classes, as it stands there is no reason to pick any of the 3 given classes when all you need to do is just throw things at the totem, why would players even bother shooting eachother when its just a short stun and you just get back up and throw things at the totem again. Also i may have misunderstood but is there no difference between shooting the top or bottom totem? Really didnt seem like that did anything while i was playing with my friend. Shooting the color of the enemies makes it so you can win for their side? But sometimes it also said that i won? Despite being a different color? 

As another review said, more variety in maps, more interactibility in the maps like powerups, specials. The geysers give you no advantage whatsoever, some platforms in the maps are inaccessible, there is no weapon variety, no character variety, switching between the characters offers you no difference as if you were to play any of the other ones. 

Holding down an attack on the magician does not hold your attack while you hold the button, it automatically shoots the attack despite you still holding down the button.

The entire flow of the gameplay feels weird, the jumping animation and speed feels off, the camera speed is weird, the forced motion blur makes it feel weird, overall just not something polished/comfortable/satisfying.

Changing the camera sensitivity in the options does not work.

The tutorial area is very easy to boundary-break, i was able to go outside of the confines of the map quite easily.

On the final enemy in the tutorial it often glitches an i cannot continue without restarting the tutorial.

The map, for what the gameplay is trying to do, is very small. I think the gameplay would hugely benefit with these changes:

- Players should be able to kill eachother, upon death a short respawn timer places them at opposite sites of the map
- The map/s should be way way bigger with more verticality introduced, more travel options and enough distance so that it takes a bit of time to get back to the center (the totem) so that it is an advantage for the teams to kill eachother and put more points into the totem so they can win faster.
- More platforms, more powerups and for some maps i would say a penalty for being thrown off the platform (like the quicksand but something more death-y
- More purpose to the classes, for example the magician could give a speed buff to the spearmen or healing, thus it is advantageous to keep them alive so you can hit the totem to your side while defending it against the other team
- Bigger player count, 1v1 is just boring as it stands
- More purpose to turning the totem, other than winning the game, maybe you get a small damage buff if your team has more points? 
- More ways for teams to compete with eachother, buffs/debuffs, attacks that slow down other players in more ways than just the stun animation?

"I’m pretty sure the fact this was requested for almost a decade means we should have no delusions of what it is. It’s exactly what they’re advertising.

We all already knew Sarajevo Six was this and still asked for a port DLC. Now Hitman WoA is truly complete.

I also think it’s ridiculous to act like buying a whole ass console is “free”, and Hitman 1 was awful. Even if you have a PS console you’d be stuck playing it in the horrendous engine/mechanics of the original, and have to pay like $30 just to get it on PS. Is it even listed now?

$5 without a sale is nothing for a current version port of something that seemed impossible to get released. Especially with the years of requests and attempts to get a barely functional mod achieving this.

They listened.

As for the actual missions they’re basically replayable elusive targets. So minor level changes, alternate target, and a narrative.

My least favorite of it in 1 was Colorado, where the target was constantly surrounded by guards that I think even see through your disguise. That’s probably more tolerable, even a fun challenge in 3. In 1’s bad mechanics pre-upgrades in sequels it’s a nightmare.

My favorite was the final mission’s mission story. There’s unique dialogue and resolution in the final target if you do it the story way, and it was neat.",0,1
"Generic platformer that has no business using so many resources.

Because the game was created for mobile phones, the controls are relatively simple. You only move left and right and jump. The fact that you can only jump from a level surface makes the game a little irritating. If you try to leap while standing on an incline, nothing will happen. 

Another major issue is that going left does not correctly move the screen with you. Most games place the character in the center of the screen and move it as you push left or right. In this game, the screen starts moving when you’re almost near the left edge of the screen. 

You take on the role of a black creature who lives in a colorless world. Because you merely glide over the surface, there are no fancy animations. Your character's white eyes ensure that you don't get lost in the darkness. The same goes for enemies whose eyes are red.

Stages are played in a linear order. Although you can jump on enemies and kill them, the stages are mostly platforming challenges. Collecting various stuff doesn’t really matter. The most common are mushrooms that give you extra life if you collect a hundred of them. There are also collectibles such as lanterns and letters that spell your name.

You can take three hits with normal enemies. However, platforming is hard because you burst like a bubble upon a smallest touch with hazards. These come in the form of spiky enemies, saws, holes, etc. 

Very unwelcome surprise is that the game uses insane amount of resources. My computer can run modern games, and this game is taking half or more of everything, from CPU to memory. This is unacceptable for a generic 2D game with no colors or animations. I assume there’s something else running along with the game and I'm not willing to risk it.",1,0

"I played this game during a free playtest week. While I enjoyed the game and would recommend it, there are definitely a few glaring issues. 

Performance. The game runs fine at a stable 60fps but the amount of input lag, rubber banding and bugs i encountered leave me less confident.
The playerbase is small, really small. Often there would only be 10 people playing, total, across all servers. For a game such as this, this is the biggest issue and can leave a game dead before it even launches.
Next is the bugs. Getting stuck on terrain, wall clipping, XP not being given or being reset. I leveled to lvl 17 4 times before it finally ticked over to level 18, and at least half the games, It would show me getting xp, but none of the bars would move.
Lastly, the price. For a game like this, It would be perfect as a free to play game, but at $40 AUD, it is way overpriced for what it is.
This game is good and fun, and a lot of the issues do feel like things which can be fixed over time, but how it is now, I would only play it if it went f2p",0,1

Later edit: I've seen that the dev already patched out most of the stuff I was talking about down here. Nice! 🤘

This is a nice game but it need a lot of work on every aspect of it. The game is extremely dark, you can only see with your flashlight and you are continuously looking for batteries. Bring more light and more batteries into the game! The sky is clear, it shouldn't be this dark, not even at night. The shooting sound is also too loud. You basically won't know what to do and where to go, if you interact with something in the area you won't know what you did and why. The game won't tell you anything. The creature AI is also weird and inside the house it gets super speed (it killed me two times inside the generators building and both times it moved super fast and it killed me from a distance of 2-3 meters, I couldn't even see it). Also, I've searched like 2-3 landmarks for a gas can (for generators) until I ran out of batteries... Why are the gas cans so scarce??

"You’ll need a good hardware to enjoy all the visual goodies of this game.

This is one of those titles that come out every week. It's an indie horror walking sim that tries to provide some experience while keeping you amused for an hour or two. It's much more enjoyable when there are some unforgettable moments.

While nothing will kill you, there are creepy monsters in the game. You might see them walk in the distance or suddenly jump into your face with a loud sound. It might go for cheap scares, but that’s fine every once in a while. While the game doesn’t tell you what needs to be done, you usually need to find a key or a code. This is quite tricky because there are no visual hints.

A game must have something unique to stand out. This one has a very realistic visual style that attempts to replicate actual life and aspect ratio locked to 4:3. Unfortunately, you need a strong hardware to experience this. If you go with any setting lower than high, you’ll have to look at boring textures without any visual goodies that make the visuals unique. Going with ultra, on the other hand, slows the game to a crawl. In my opinion, indie games should be accessible, which is impossible if you require the best hardware to even run them.

Overall, the gameplay is very linear and has no story. You're stuck in some type of rooms and hallways that change as you step forward into the dark. The game keeps moving you from one area to the next. Except for one or two areas that are way too dark, everything looks decent. To be honest, there are some stunning locations, such as the art gallery and dining room. 

After a few rooms, you'll see a brief cutscene before the game simply ends. There are no achievements or bonuses.",0,1

"UPDATE:

After getting back into it and playing it after a few months I can see the ladder climbing is a bit better however its still a pain to deal with like in blast pit and places where you have to climb really long ladders, it'd be better if it was like HL Alyx where you could just  teleport to the top of them.

Also one big issue I have is the more you die the more the audio breaks and after a while only a handful of sounds will play so you have to restart. This was a big problem for me in blast pit as its easy to fail the jumps that land you in the toxic waste, some jumps are a pain to make so would be nice if you could teleport across some gaps. 

The trains are a bit hard to control, not sure if I'm just doing it wrong but I really don't understand how to make them go forward and backward. 

Most guns reload sounds don't play so you can't tell if they reloaded unless you look at the ammo count. 

Some of the soldiers audio sounds slowed down for some reason.

Weapon switching is in now but its very inconvenient, you have to scroll through them all to get to the right one, would be nice if there was a weapon wheel.

Overall a bit better now and more playable but there are still a lot of issues that can hopefully be improved upon. 


Original Review:

A good start but definitely needs a lot more work, some of the ladders you can't even climb to the top at all making progression impossible unless you switch to legacy ladder climbing, would be nice if you could just teleport up ladders like in Alyx. Also there seems to be literally no way to switch your weapon at all, you have to take off the headset and change weapon from the game on your desktop so that sucks. Also the movement and turning is a bit nausea inducing, really needs teleport with blink turning. There's also no way to change options from in the game, you need to exit it to launch the config tool and there's no way to open up the normal game menu in VR, you have to take off your headset if you want to change options or load/save game. Also one really bad thing is the game seems to crash quite often so that sucks, sadly wouldn't recommend in its current state, will change review if the mod gets updated.",1,0
"Probably one of my favorite weapon packs. FMJ is really cool and good for stealth (in theory) but is severely destroyed by its cool animation. Folding and unfolding is a nice touch but actually adds time onto drawing and putting it away which makes having a second weapon annoying at best. Shotgun is good, and tarkov, but the Gecko is really what shines, probably one of the best pistols in the game in my opinion??? Internally suppressed so you can put on 2 total muzzle devices, and has shotgun push which means you can do what the judge does without risking accidentally shooting glass with a stray pellet or something. Really good damage and concealment so it's good for stealth or for loud if you wanted.",0,1

"[h1]Better than Aim Labs[/h1]

While Femboy Aim Trainer is technically an ""Aim Trainer"" it definitely can't be used as such. I think the game is capped at 60 fps too... I could be wrong but I doubt my PC would run so laggy on a small game like this. Just like the two installments before femboy aim trainer, the actual aiming itself is weird. If you try to do a 360, you will see your sensitivity is just wrong. I think some acceleration is put on, and should not be on by default like the last 2 games. 

[b]IF[/b] Femboy Aim Trainer got the options to turn mouse acceleration off and on, same as Raw Input in the controls I think I would legitimately use it... as a joke... definitely. The game could also use better video settings, like drop downs so its easier to change resolution, and please for the love of god uncapped fps. And I would wish the Sensitivity in the game was easier to understand and incorporate sensitivities from other games into Femboy Aim Trainer. 

I do think the game probably uses artwork they... might have not been able to use... but besides that its pretty good for its price and definitely has some amount of work put into it even if it does take a lot of assets from henti aim trainer.

"100% complete in 2.5 hrs, waaay too easy. Strength stat outweighs anything newer cards brings you so you're fighting the final boss with nothing but fist bump and fortress.

The waifus are well designed with good variety. It's a shame you get exactly one position for each one though, because the ones I liked most had positions that didn't do it for me. 

Frankly, just not enough content for the price. You can get Last Evil for the same price and play it for 100 hours. That's a bit extreme, sure, but this game clearly fails the ""dollar per hour"" rule. There are obviously unused areas in the world map, so maybe an expansion down the road?",1,0

"[h1]Experienced on the Meta Quest 2[/h1]

You can view my initial impressions review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/kIe8xb8gedY

If you're wondering is this better than Vermillion VR, then my answer is a quick no. I enjoyed painting with Vermillion a lot more than Painting VR. Why? I just think that Vermillion is a more smooth & polished experience and it also has better painting physics (more realistic). 

However, Painting VR is still a very good painting app for VR. I would say it's the second best painting experience in VR, but clearly a notch below Vermillion. This app kind of feels like an Early Access app. I think the UI could use some work 

Still, I had a blast painting with this app and I could see some people preferring this over Vermillion. You can watch my video and see how easily I drew a Boston Terrier (my dog) and how it looked pretty darn good. I surprised myself completely. I definitely think you should buy both apps if you can afford it and see which one you prefer.

App is running on the Unity Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting 75-90 frames per second. You do have full locomotion and teleportation available, along with smooth and snap turning available. I did not experience any serious issues or bugs, however, there was some clunkiness all around. When I clicked on clean room, it undid some of the changes on the canvas that I didn't want and some stuff would still lay about. Or some paint in some stuff that I didn't want. It's just a bit messy.

[b]Rate 7/10. I highly recommend you buy Vermillion or Painting VR, they are both wonderful painting apps. If you can afford it, why not both? [/b]

[quote]Please note: I received a free Steam key through the Steam Curator Connect program. However, I had already purchased this app on the App Store for Oculus with my own money.

This was quite possibly the most artistic piece of art I have ever touched. From the second you boot up the game the cacophonous fanfare immediately immerses you into the game.,1,0
"i saw this game on reddit and liked the style and was pleased there was a demo, played the demo and i liked most of what it had to offer but had some issues which weren't unique to me and the developer seemed aware of and said they would try and tweak. so i thought i'd just wait for the full version to come out and see what it would be like as long as the price was reasonable.

now that i've spent an hour or so with the full game i have some key points;

- visually i really enjoy the game, love the neon world and car design and the fact each car has a unique interior

- sound wise the music fits and each car seems to have different sounding engines though some things could use a little sound effect like the starting lights just to help give an audio que the race is starting

- control wise the game feels just fine, turning works and the shifting mechanic is absolutely the best, if more racing games had something like that i would play with manual transmission more often. however, the collision physics are just wacky, a little tap from another racer sends you flying and it's torture to turn around. the drifting function is a toss up between it working or sending you in to a wall. it just detracts from the joy of shifting and driving fast. too many things bring you to an absolute halt. it's ok to have obstacles, but when your AI cars get absolutely destroyed by them it shows that maybe a work around on recovery needs to be done to speed up getting back on track and running again

- on the main menu there are issues when using a mouse and controller together as it's almost impossible to just use one. you have to mainly use the mouse as the controller can't selct all options or it's almost impossible to know what you've actually selected

- coins from the races you run don't add up, i should have been able to buy a new car and try it out but i couldn't i would only have my winnings from the previous race

- difficulty seems wildly unreliable, it's either that or the way the physics keep you from going a decent speed from getting stuck on walls or spun around from a light tap but even on normal it's almost impossible to keep up

- the warp ability for one of the cars sends you way forward in the race, but you lose all speed and if on manual mode you have to down shift yourself before attempting to try and get speed back again and any advantage you had is lost entirely

- the game is missing even a little hint at the ""why"" of the whole thing, why are you racing? why is it a death race? why are their people shooting you from the side of the track? i know it's just a thing to add difficulty, but even in a lot of other basic racing games there's a bit of something to make you want to move forward and keep racing? rivalries, characters that drive each car that are out to win for their own unique reason, a violent future where people race to claim power, unsanctioned gang racing because police have cracked down on other forms of combat, it's the biggest sporting event on the planet, anything that could give purpose to playing. 

- that leads to progression, there is none. you have everything from the beginning minus car you want to drive. all tracks are just open so it doesn't give you any reason to try hard to beat a race, you can lose and then just move on to the next one. why not group a couple tracks together as a leg of a tourney? once you win or come a certain place you can unlock the next 2 and so on. going for high score is fine, but there's just nothing keeping you from just picking the last track and never playing any of the others, a grand prix mode maybe? you could still have free play on any track but you have to unlock it from a grand prix type set up first?

- the hud on the 1st person view needs more info, you should be able to know what position you're in, what lap you're on at least. it does appear you listened to some comments and added the gear shifter to that screen which was amazingly helpful, but why not make it so either you have the place or lap either there but smaller, or maybe appear when you hit the clutch button? i had also suggested giving options for what you want on the screen during a race, that way you could have it clean or have as much info as you'd want.

- there should be a setting menu to set preferred difficulty, lap number, rival number, and hazards in the main menu or have the game remember settings from play session to session

i really want to like this game, it has so many things i like and the price for it really isn't that bad, but as it stands i can only suggest to play the demo and see if you like it, if not the game in it's current form just doesn't do it and i feel bad i don't like it more. i love racing games and feel this one could be so much cooler than it is. i hope you continue working on it and regardless of what i said here good luck to you and keep it up. i'm hoping i can check it out in the future to see what's improved.

"If I could, I'd give this a neutral recommendation. It has a really neat premise and is pretty interesting. The extra prologue afterwards is especially nice in rounding things up

Sadly, I thought this was just a bit too brief to really have a lasting impact (and I do personally enjoy very short games a lot) and the writing could do with a lot of touch ups - there's a few missing commas and everything feels a bit amateurish, especially the text for news articles

My main issue though, to put it bluntly, is that I was not very good at this. The gist is, for each person, you're given a brief description of their problems and a handful of memories. You have to delete one to try and shift their future. I was getting almost all of them wrong and didn't really know what the game wanted from me in most cases. It's not very obvious what your choices will do and from what I can tell, there's only one save file, so you have to restart if you want to try different choices

This didn't completely sour the experience though, it's still a solid narrative! I just wish it had a bit more polish to it

Basically, it's not bad but you won't miss out on much by skipping this one. Personally, I would recommend Killing Time At Light Speed more, since it vaguely aims for similar things but is overall a fuller experience",1,0
"Good but frustrating

TLDR: I would enjoy this game 200% more if it was a mobile game. 

This game is like a tamagotchi that can't leave your house, which for some people who (for instance) work from home don't need to worry about. 

I don't work from home.

This game's main gimmick is that it only runs in the background for a certain amount of time, with the maximum limit being 8 hours, after which the game will stop in its tracks and does not progress. 
You can reset this, but if it ever lapses you don't progress until you reset it. 

Again, you ONLY have 8 hours maximum before the game freezes. 

There is no worse feeling than coming home from work after a long shift to get on your computer for a couple hours only to find that absolutely nothing has progressed.

This game demands an amount of attention that I am not physically able to give it often enough for things to progress at a meaningful rate that engages me enough to care about it. 

And that really sucks because otherwise this game is great, but the pacing has FULLY lost me because of the issues I've described.

I wish the game had a longer default timer, something like 12 hours would be far more reasonable.

"I agree with another reviewer who said it's an ""OK"" DLC. Just to put my review in perspective, at the time of this review I have 1145 hours in MW5 + all DLC and no mods. I started a new career and jumped right into the DLC campaign (this was recommended vs. importing from a previous save) and it starts you off with a bunch of nice mechs + pilots. You also have the opportunity to get T5 equipment from caches in the missions. However, as usual, the game is rigged to gank the player and you should expect to get heavily damaged, plus your AI teammates suck and they will do stupid things and get damaged (nothing new about that). What I found surprising and frustrating was that during the campaign there are a lot of missions that aren't exactly ""back-to-back"" but give you like 3-7 days to repair, which isn't enough. This is even worse than with the other DLC campaigns. It seems like the devs agree with a trend in game dev that imposing time constraints and raising the stress level = more fun. I almost rage quit a few times over this, until I decided to just accept the fact that I was going to lose good parts, mechs, and pilots during this campaign. Instead of getting salvage points, I switched to getting cash and buying new mechs from the marketplace for almost every mission (towards the end). And yeah, the longbow kind of sucks (poor armor, and AI wants to rush forward with it instead of hanging back; as the player you just get ganked normally so poor armor is a bad idea for your own mech). So is it worth it? Well if you're like me and you play tons of this game and have all the other DLCs, then yeah get this DLC because it adds more missions, mechs, and T5 caches to your game. If that's not you, then maybe wait for a sale.",0,1

I guess it's technically my own fault, but did I really need to learn this the hard way? I mean, the game literally asked if I wanted to delete the previous save and I chose not to. Pretty misleading.

So people, DO NOT RELY ON AUTOSAVE ONLY! Save your game to a distinct save slot, so you won't accidentally overwrite your progress like I did.",0,1

Way too many of these in the game as is. Only one I'd feel is appropriate to add at this point is a Rocky Mountain Elk or something. Still, this DLC has some crazy good add-ins so it's worth recommending, just not psyched that 2 of them are both two more damn bovidae...",0,1

[h1]Good things:[/h1] 

This game is a mix of 4 mini games. There is hidden objects game and there is match 3 game and there is a game where you have to pick the right ingredients to create cupcakes according to orders and one game where you have to put toppings on the pizza in the right spots.

You can upgrade your recipes in your recipe book to make your dishes give you more money and you can also upgrade your restaurant for it to look better. You can also buy hints and boosters for hog mini game. All in all hidden objects game is the biggest part of this game.

[h1]Bad things:[/h1] 

To tell the truth I really only liked the cupcakes mini game as it was the one that was the most close to real cooking. The second good mini game was the pizza one but it had many strange ingredients as topping like potato chips or things covered in chocolate but all in all it was an ok game as you try to match your pizza look to the one that was ordered. The match 3 game was really basic and it was not interesting at all and the game even gives you free hints what to move where if you don’t click anything for 3 seconds.

The main part of the game is hidden objects game and by far it is the worst part of this game. The products are lying all over kitchen/restaurant even on ground or are floating in the air so they are all over the place just randomly put everywhere and the whole kitchen/restaurant looks like a chaos and health and safety hazard. Also the whole cooking is just clicking the products in order that are displayed under the customer one by one and that makes the recipe book pointless as you can’t just remember what ingredients are needed for a dish and just click them when you see them – no you have to click the one ingredient that is displayed under the customer and only after that you can click another one and another one. It would be much better if they would just get rid of the whole hidden objects game and instead let you pick ingredients and mix them up in order to cook a meal just like you do in the cupcake mini game.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1] 

This is just a mix of 4 mini games and I found only 1 of them to be fun. If you are looking for fun cooking game look somewhere else.

"Hyper precision platformer genre has exploded in the last few years. And this is as frustrating as any other. Which I guess is the point, just not something I can recommend to people that aren't into hair pulling.

Individually a lot of the mechanics like inertia, wall bonk and the pit falls work fine. The combination of them makes it so you have to overcorrect each little movement. And the level design supports that. The visuals are simple, but effective. On the other hand, the sound design is also simple, but is incredibly annoying.

Monk is the only one that has a unique skill (almost unique anyway, only seen it drop once on another class) and its probably the best skill. 
 The issue is the game is pretty boring, get aoe skill on low cooldown.  Sit in one place till boss arrives, kill boss open chest, repeat till next boss.  Some of the skills don't do much, strength and agility seems pretty useless.  Agility speeds you up a little but not enough to outrun later stage bosses that just one shot you. 
Projectile skills are pretty pointless.  They don't fire often enough so are unreliable.  Unless you have a PBAoE, you just die.",0,1

For example an actual max range on AoE attacks. But I can excuse some of this stuff as it being early, it's still fun in just a shut your brain off and have fun with friends sort of way. Plus I've yet to meet a single toxic person, which might be because you constantly match against the same people. But still.

" I wish I could leave a review without a recommendation. I feel kinda crappy recommending it with the state it's in but I don't want to screw up the ratio for this fledgling project and I don't know how steam store algorithms work.
This needs work.
This isn't vapor ware. This isn't a early access, take the money and run scheme. This is a labor of love, but it is rough right now. It's dirt cheap, and I think once it's polished it'll be worth the money. It's still definitely EA though. It looks to be a deep sim with fun deck building elements. There might be too many things going on and not enough focus applied to the meat of it, but that's just my guess with my little play time.

The UI is aggressively bad. If it's not pretty it should at least be clean. This is hard to look at and decipher. The clouds aren't immersive they're smudges. If that pixel mobster doesn't quit blowing smoke at my face then this confusion is going to turn into frustration. Everything should be one font. Different fonts for different screens? Cool. Six different typefaces for the main screen (Kill the rat, End turn, Italy level 1, Money menu, Card descriptions, and the helvetica letters over pxel art cookies that are the POIs)? Oof. 

Also there are a bunch of tool tips and tutorials, however the're embedded and competing with all the other clutter. I don't know what order I should be clicking them and it's tiresome to learn stuff out of context and have to experiment. I don't mind when games ask you to fail to learn, but from what I've seen from everything else I don't know if this will be worth that effort. There are video tutorials, but none tell me how all these mechanics the game is throwing at me relate to each other or the win condition. I like complicated games, and I like that some things have minigames, but I am in the weeds here. I don't need it all laid out for me, learning is part of the fun of complex games, but I would at least like to know what I'm getting into.

Criticisms aside, I think there's a gem under all this. There are a lot of mechanics at work here, a lot of systems to jump into. I don't think I could come up with something like this and the dev has clearly put a bunch of work in. I'm all for supporting indie devs, and there are some ideas I really like here. So I'm not gunna ask for a refund. I'm going to check back in on this in a few months and see where this goes.",0,1
"I played 2 of the playtests and got this game the day early access went live. Here are some of the pros and cons-

Pros-
-Has a reconnect feature.
-Has an Auction house that can been used after reaching account level 5.
-Spawn into matches with at least 1 free healing item depending on class.
-Can get looted and geared up fairly quickly.
-Feels pretty good as an extraction looter.
-Can Queue up for solo matches or as a group of 3.

Cons-
-Matchmaking times for me are generally 1-2 minutes
-Have not been placed into a full lobby since the first 2 days of release.
-Hit registration on some weapons is very poor.
-Enemy corpses will sometimes bug out and appear to be alive with odd collision issues.
-Destroyed doors will sometimes have bugged collision leading to an odd hiccups when trying to go through the doorway.
-Rarely enemies will experience some form of visual desync making that almost un-hittable.
-No form of balanced matchmaking, a lot of people go into solo matchmaking with min-maxed gear and an inventory full of meds with the only goal of killing other players.
-Currently there are only 2 map layouts for solo and group matchmaking.
-It is not uncommon for players familiar with map layout to rush other player spawns.
-Very small player base at the moment (slightly over 400 according to steam charts as of 11/16/2023)
-This game will forever be compared to Dark and Darker. 

For anyone who wants a more direct comparison to Dark and Darker-
Greed is Good has an auction house,however, it has fewer- Weapons/ Weapon types, Classes, Maps/Map Layouts and Enemy variety/Bosses.

"Well, you can certainly roll.

Wolf Souls is a pretty buggy mess, but just looking at the steam page should clue you into that.

The gameplay is incredibly simple, enemies generally only have one attack pattern and its the exact same stock attack animation with hitboxes that will either linger after the animation plays out or hit you before it's even begun. There's a few enemies that break this mold, but they aren't really much of a threat either since you've got a ranged spell in your kit. The enemy AI is also basic. No sneaking up for back stabs, no parrying, they just see you and they rush in to attack. Unless they get stuck on some part of the environment, which is prone to happening a lot.

Getting hit really isn't that big of an issue either, your HP recovers slowly over time so you're free to simply juke around the enemies or stand around til your health is back to full. You have a healing spell, but there isn't really any point to using it because of the self healing, plus it costs souls to use. The only thing that'll one shot you are these weird troll dudes that deal 500 damage. I think they only appear twice, and the first time is at the very beginning of the game for some reason.

Speaking of souls, you can use these to level up. Enemies drop them, and occasionally you'll find them from exploring the level. Usually in games like these, the stronger the enemy is, the more souls they drop, but I believe every enemy drops just one soul here. Sometimes, you won't be able to pick the souls up though! I've had to leave behind several souls because just walking over them wasn't enough to grab them I guess. It also took me until nearly the end of the game to figure out how to level up lol. Real game journalist tier gaming here.

You'll find different weapons throughout the game which are just flat buffs. They all have the exact same attack speed, just with different damage rates, so there's no reason to choose one weapon over another. You carry your currently equipped weapon into following levels, but upon dying, you default back to the basic sword. Not sure if that's intentional, but I don't like it, personally. There's no inventory either, so the weapon's gone once you die until you find a new one.

There's two bosses, the first one aggros onto you before you even drop into its proper boss arena, so you can just stand up on the ledge above it and spam your magic spell until it dies. The second one is the ghost lady you fight in a cemetery. Now, normally you're supposed to walk past the cemetery gates and they close behind you, trapping you in with the boss. On my second attempt to fight the boss, I managed to accidentally close the gates without getting into the cemetery so the boss fight was triggered, but I had no way to get in and actually fight the boss. I DID however, manage to scale up a hill and make it to the end of the level without killing the boss, so speedrun strats.

Uhhh, other small things: 

[list]
    [*] Holding the run key or tapping the roll key drain your stamina even if you aren't actually moving.

    [*] Sound design sucks, enemies make... lion roars for some reason? Some actions don't even have sound effects, like objects breaking.

    [*] Many grammatical errors in the very few bits of text that are in the game. I understand these guys aren't native English speakers, but you should probably hire someone to proofread your game before you release it as a paid product.

    [*] Platforming is very bad. thankfully, there's only one part that expects you to platform and it's totally optional.

    [*] Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the dodge roll actually gives you any i-frames. If it does, consider adding an ds2 adp stat to level up or just make the roll better lmao

    [*] The ""You Died"" screen and the level up menu are actually really charming. I don't think it's original art for the game, since just about every other asset appears to be stock, but they have these goofy looking skeletons in robes that don't quite fit in with the game's aesthetic and it's SOOO good.

    [*] You can't pet the wolf.

"I... I'm torn.

There's a lot to like about this game. One thing I really enjoyed is how it framed online relationships and their impact on people - especially with these things becoming more common. The music is fantastic. I did enjoy the first half of the story, and the twists along the way.

But... I wish it had been original characters. Given the team behind it, I'd have bought it even without the Fata Morgana characters popping up. And I think it would've been stronger without them being included.

The ending was a let down, for me. It just seemed so tonally different from Fata Morgana, and it soured the experience right at the end.

Do I recommend it? I really don't know. I'm saying yes because I did enjoy the majority of it.",0,1
"One of those situations where you wish Steam had a middle option between 'yes' and 'no'. First of all, the new civs are well designed and interesting. Armenia and Georgia are long overdue additions to the game, and both are fun and unique to play, as is the revamped Persia. If you only play multiplayer or skirmish vs AI then I think you'll have fun with this DLC.

On the other hand, if you are here only for the single player campaigns, I'd give it a miss. I should say that the map design and presentations of the campaigns are excellent, as always, with some interesting framing stories (for those interested in them!) However, all three new campaigns follow a trend that started with Rise of Rome's weak Trajan campaign, in that they seem specifically designed for co-op. Of the fifteen new missions, ten are clearly designed in this way (featuring either the player and a similarly powerful ally facing off against two or three roughly equal enemies on a fairly open map, or the player capturing towns which are then handed over to an initially passive ally to get them into the fight). 

There's nothing wrong with this mission type in principle, but I found the repetitiveness of the missions (especially in the Ismail campaign) disappointing. I've had some fun times completing co-op missions with friends, but for me (and most campaign players I imagine), the main selling point of any AoE2 DLC is three new interesting, varied campaigns with missions packed with triggers, side objectives and unique tactical situations to overcome (the Jadwiga, Hauteville or Rajendra campaigns for example), not straightforward 2v2s with a bit of flavour and a pre-built base. Absolutely no disrespect intended to the designers of course. I suspect that they had a very tight deadline and were rushed, and we've seen that they're capable of incredible work in other campaigns.

In conclusion, fun civs but uninspired campaign missions, unfortunately.",1,0

I'm getting a ""Fatal error"" and a crash when restarting the app, but it works the first time. 

It might work well in 2D, but I'm only into VR.

"Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass for now. The atmosphere and sound design is great so far, and I'm pretty interested to see how the story develops. However, this game really needs some more optimization. My pc run like a jet engine and it seems turning down certain settings actually puts more pressure on my cpu. There's also no way to rebind keys from the looks of things, which is a strange omission, In general, it feels like this game needed some more polishing before release. 

Navigating to the different objectives can be a little confusing but I'm not gonna fully judge that quite yet. I will say that I appreciate when a game is able to direct you through good level design and other in-game queues, as apposed to just relying on a quest marker or a mini-map, and I really hope that's the case for this game. 

For now, I would wait and see.",1,0

"Oh boy..Ok lets take a look at this one. Just as a heads up ill be spoiling the story a bit at the end and this is a not to heavy biased opinion of the game. Its my impressions as someone who reviews games, a competitive player and as a consumer (as with all my reviews.) 

So, lets start out with the overall look at the game. This time we are working with Sledgehammer which has a..not so great history so far with Call Of Duty. Between working on Vanguard, WWII, and Advanced Warfare, the community was already skeptical, and praying that they would not mess this one up. Yea....

Lets look at the story. Even when I played it on the hardest difficulty, the main story only took me about 5 hours if that to complete, which even CODs with lack luster story still take between cutscenes and all, about 6 or 7. Going mission by mission: 
Started strong with 627, kinda a cool way to show off the game and get people familiar with ol' Vlad.
Precious Cargo: was...yikes ok. To follow the STARTING mission with this new type of game play was..just a bad idea. 
Reactor: Even worse than than the first one, map design was boring and objectives simple and...a minigun..? 
Payload: A little better, more what I expected as a filler mission from COD.
Deep Cover: It takes..3 Minutes tops..and its all cut scene, I would hardly classify this as a mission.
Passenger: The same thing but a really really good filler..not a full mission, same kinda idea as prior games.
Crash site: THE WORST OC (Open Combat) Mission of the entire game and to be honest overall. 
Flashpoint: I don't even remember what happens in this mission...
Oligarch: Just..bad
Highrise: Just play the multiplayer with a shotgun, same difference but even easier.
Frozen Tundra: Pretty simple basic COD mission, it was meh and kinda lack luster. 
Gora Dam: What the OC mission should have been, the ONLY OC mission, and it was still stupid easy unless you try to full stealth the mission and even then its pretty easy.
Danger Close: A basic AC-130 mission that everyone loves but will be disappointed in this one in comparison to the last installment. 
Trojan Horse: Started strong and ended were the game should have started in terms of quality. 

Overall of the Story: The campaign left much to be desired, I dont know where the major malfunction was between the team, if it was the direction, the publisher, or the overall team. The graphics were poor even compared to the first installment, and I would compare it to Advanced Warfare graphics even on the highest setting on a good rig. The cutscenes lagged and stuttered which I mean common..its a pre rendered cutscene? The AI, even on hard or above were dead and really lack luster even going as far as to basically not even react a lot of the time are be on par to grunts from a game like Titanfall. And no..adding armor to them like..juggernauts when its some sniper in a white cloak? Does not make the game more fun. The big one, the Open Combat missions. Honestly I like the idea, maybe not with this execution but it was the same kinda idea as the hide and fight SERE mission of the prior game with Soap and Ghost just with guns and armor so eh, the tension is not there nor the strategy. I think the idea could be much better executed and keep it maybe one or two missions, NOT HALF YOUR GAME. It was a lazy way to present character and story on par to a Co-op mission from MWII. 
And of course..the ending. I know for a fact these voice actors can act, I really really do. The last mission was..ok, again should have kinda started like this in the second mission, not the last. The trains wising by, the team effort, the tension! It made it at least somewhat interesting and real. Soap not making it through this mission just to set up for a clifhanger, and the way they sent him off? That was lazy, and a huge disservice to the character. Not to mention the Voice over work for being shot, the reaction to his death from the three, hell between Price and Ghost? There should have been way more emotion..I mean even the old school MWIII got that right..

Overall the campaign left much much to be desired, especially for the price tag and the people who loved this new story line. It felt very rushed, very lazy, and very lackluster. We watched these guys breach and clear houses with the SAS, the tension as people walked feet next to you, the crazy feeling of shooting UPSIDE DOWN FROM A CHOPPER. Being hunted down by an entire city, and this? This is how this guy goes out and how the story goes? It was just..not good. From the Open Combat missions, to the stupid amounts of armor and prompts that try to simulate the game being at all longer, to the two intractable cutscenes they call missions, to even just the Voice Acting and overall look of the game. More effort and love could have been put into this even if it took longer, and pricing it at 70$? If your looking to play the game just for the story, just watch someone else, or wait for the sale. 



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The multiplayer. 

Ok, now that we are done with the main reason anyone bought this, lets move on. 

Just to keep it short and sweet, this is stuff that should have been included in the second game, this is just basically a glorified DLC but worse core mechanics. If you wanna buy this one for the multiplayer..dont. Play MWII, its the same but somehow better. 

Now, as someone who played the open beta and got a bunch of feedback from my friends and other competitive players, it felt great then! It felt more arcade like, smaller maps in the TDM and Free for All modes, the guns were the same but eh, and the old maps were just as fun as before! Sounds great yea? 

I was super excited to see when the full game came out being able to use my old guns and play these maps again and just feel that old school joy! I did not get that at all. On full release, the time to kill was DRASTICALLY increased..like to a not fun amount. I have to almost mag dump for one kill or hit headshots, and before anyone says ""just aim for the head"" I want to know what part of Call Of Duty multiplayer SOUNDS or looks like a tactical shooter where it really matters with 15 bullets. Thanks to their nifty little death bar when you die, you can now see just how many shots, how much damage, and etc the guy who killed you did. It took one guy with what is considered the best current AR in the game, 9 shots to kill me. That may not sound like much in terms of numbers but in game it just feels...off. 

Snipers are much more fun to play with same with some shotguns and rifles, the SMGs were complacently made useless , the map rotation was added to include some bigger maps which I still don't really understand for matches of 5v5 or 10v10 but sure, make it different, Only a few new guns per section thus my DLC comment, it just feels like MWII but with well..DLC content or added maps they were already adding. The new idea of different vest for different buffs I feel was good and ok, same with the perk system being about the same with some eyebrow raises of maybe some inspiration from..other games. 

The multiplayer feels..basic and not in a good way. It just seems like a copy paste of MWII with worse balancing or for a better idea, to much. All the guns feel the same, nothing new, and I don't even want to use the new guns, I just fall back to old reliable from the prior game. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall~ I feel the game is not at worth no 70$...It felt rushed and not as much love
I would wait for it to be on sale and even then I would hesitate. I feel like the fault mostly falls on the direction staff. The story being lackluster, the multiplayer being a gloried DLC, the voice actors being kinda bland compared to before, the writing, the layout, the graphics.",1,0
"For 10€ I basically got my money out of it.

Pros:
+ Relaxing
+ No Stress
+ Cute Graphics
+ Smooth and Stable Framerate
+ Not overloaded

Cons:
- Constant Micro Management
- No AI Path Updates if you change roads/tracks
- Missclicks may lose you resources
- No Techtrees or guidelines that help you keep track of your goals

Overall a solid and fun EA title, sadly not fleshed out at the moment of this review. The biggest problem is the constant micro management of your dig sites. A regular chain looks like this:

- find mineral patch
- build extractor on it
- build depots near it
- transport from depot to facility
- transport from facility to construction center

The problem is now: extractors only work on the hex field they are build on and depots have a limited operating area (1 to 2 adjacent hex fields). Sooner or later your extracots stop working and you have to readjust your cargo lines, because the stops are not close enough anymore to pick up materials. And if you delete the start of a cargo line, all the vehilces on that line and the materials they are carrying are deleted. You can avoid this by spamming more depots in between, but that looks unappealing pretty fast and only does so much. 

After a few hours you are constantly fixing and rebuilding dig sites, because you have so many and they all need your attention. The game doesn't warn you, when extractors stop working, so you have to be on the lookout yourself.

To level up and unlock new stuff you have to meet certain criteria. Sadly the game doesn't remind you, what your goal is at the current level. It tells you once you reach the level. After that, you are on your own. I played for two hours before realising my colonists wanted food now and I still haven't figured out how to get food in the first place. Maybe there is a resource that I haven't found yet or I have to do some more terraforming? I don't know. The game doesn't tell me. Some basic goals to keep track of what I am trying to achieve would be nice.

Again, for 10€ I was very much entertained the whole time but right now it's sadly not fleshed out enough. If you are looking for a more in depth terraforming game, check out Surviving Mars.",0,1

"""Bicycle Rider Simulator"" would have been better suited in Early Access than a full release at this point. While it seems to be a genuine attempt at making something fun there are some issues that drag it down. They are nothing that couldn't be fixed - but then there's another specter called ""suspected review manipulation"" looming above all.

The game's foundation is [url=https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/206818]Simple Bicycle Physics[/url], a rock solid asset for simulating, well, bicycle physics. It's definitely okay to use it especially as a single developer because properly simulating complex physics systems is definitely hard and there's no need to reinvent the wheel. The landscapes seem to be mostly assets by NatureManufacture which is fine as well as the developer did their homework and actually built the tracks themselves.

Speaking about tracks, there are five and they are all locked except for the first. To unlock them you'll have to complete the previous track. There's also a plethora of different rider outfits and bicycle liveries to unlock but these can be purchased with ""coins"" which you can get simply by playing. There are no in-app purchases here.

The menus are a bit odd in that they work in the opposite direction than you might be used to. To start a ride you need to select - from bottom to top: a rider, bicycle, bicycle livery and the map, then click Start. It's rather unusual really and should in my opinion be reversed to the standard top-to-bottom reading direction but it's easy to fix.

Another bothersome thing is the translation. While the game pretends to be translated in a ton of languages they are really just Google translations - and rather poor ones at that. Some translated terms also don't fit the menu buttons properly. It's best to just switch to English which seems to be the most consistent language in terms of translation.

Even in the menus you can feel the lack of optimization. The mouse cursor is sluggish and the overall performance feels extremely low - and that's on ""Low"" graphics settings. This is no surprise - the menu background is from an actual game scene and has not been optimized at all. Of course this gets worse the higher you set the quality.

And of course it continues in the actual game. Even with a decent PC you'll run into chugging and this also leads to the controls becoming sluggish. Generally speaking riding the bike in this game isn't bad but with the performance issues it is certainly much harder than it should be. Visually it's okay although there seems to be no volumetric lighting here so everything looks a bit flat. The bike certainly looks great, the rider - and especially their animations - not so much.

Each track has checkpoints scattered around it and sometimes they feel a bit too far apart which can make things frustrating if you crashed due to laggy controls or sluggish asset streaming.

Based on all this, would I recommend it to someone who wants to ride a virtual bike? Too bad there's no ""maybe"" option on Steam - the game isn't terrible by any means and could be improved greatly with a little bit of work, namely in terms of optimizing the geometry. Once that's done it's probably worth the asking price.

Unfortunately however the developer seems to have resorted to buying Steam reviews to ""promote"" his game. At the time of writing there are 12 reviews and at least 10 of them are from accounts that have been involved in review manipulation before. All of them have been posted a short time after release, are direct Steam purchases, very short and written in broken english.  Look at the reviews and decide for yourself - there's definitely something odd going on.

Adding that to the plethora of other issues I can't possibly recommend this game, I'm sorry.

"Steam really needs a neutral review - I originally got this on iOS and after playing through it there a few times, grabbed it here to edit the saves to see how different I could get it, and after save scumming a few runs, the truth is - not that much different.
I really want to love it, because it dares to make characters that have their own agendas and you don't know their motivations, it has time skips which should allow dramatic changes from choices, it's a much more mature themed story than we normally get, and there is a spectacular build up...
...but it all ends up ending prematurely, remaining a much more on rails experience, it withholds far too much information of the world, and despite being 750k words each playthrough leaves me feeling it was much shorter.

It's not bad - it's just feels like I read (not played) a prologue to the main event.

But being part of a bigger series - if the author can introduce and implement choices and consequences better, and stick the ending for each part - it may end up being one of the greats. The foundation with the world and the characters is certainly there.",0,1

"I played the free prologue for one and a half hours which was enough for me. I enjoyed the premise of the game for I've always enjoyed the story of Robin Hood, which disappointed me that the game starts after the story we know. I would have very much enjoyed playing through the story before reaching the point where this game begins.
Now speaking more about the game play and content I just experienced. At first drop I enjoyed the atmosphere, the foliage and lighting could use a update. Overall graphics and mechanics feel like a Xbox 360 game which isn't bad but I'd not pay too much for this. What really took me back was the voice acting, especially Friar Tuck, in this game he is the equivalent to Lester from GTAV. His voice is horribly annoying and you're forced to talk to him all the time for quests. Was Tuck castrated? If so, it explains his name... -_-
Also Robin's voice was off. He sounded more like a James Bond than a Robin Hood. Not saying Kevin Costner can do any better, just saying it didn't fit the character.
It looks to have a very extensive skill tree which looked promising, and the map seemed to be of fair size, overall I'd give the game a play through, but wouldn't expect much of a replay value once beaten.",0,1

"Another ""by the numbers"" survival autshooter
+plus+
Cheap; you get what you payed for.
Sort of addicting early on.
Chill and easy to learn gameplay (almost too non-comlex).
Fun portrayal of gear on your custom 3D character.
Seems to be getting updates regularly(?).

-minus-
Kind of boring, too balanced. let loose ffs..
No ""over the top"" builds, or being ""OP"".
Diminishing returns on stats happens too early, limiting builds.
Skills/Spells are sort of boring, too random directionally; not enough control.
Boring combination of skills for ultimate/evolving.
Boring ultimate/evolved skills. Nothing creative.
Doesn't feel rewarding, even with 90% of permanent upgrades purchased.
The game is lacking that -fun- part, the x factor, that ""hmpf"".
Feels like a non-stop chase to survive in the mid/endgame.
Looks overall cheap and cobbled together with various assets;
-artstyle, player models, enemy models, icons. It doesn't have a uniform overall style.
Whole screen turning red on bosses is annoying. A red border would suffice.
Music sounds very generic and royalty-free. After an hour you're sick of it.
Lack of options; It's got the basics, but nothing more.
Seemingly only one of the classes can aquire permanent gear upgrades? Needs more testing to confirm. Kind of makes other classes a second thought, as you'll be playing this one class to chase upgrades.

This might seem like a harsh review, but it's just to forward what needs tweaking.
By no means a bad game, but to stand out it needs work.
There are better, and cheaper, games in this genre for sure.",1,0

"there is nothing wrong with the raytracing, i run it just fine at 60 fps on my 3060 ti (8gb vram). in fact i think the game looks stunning at times.
this is basically just the original mod with replaced textures, redone voice lines, and released separately on steam. 

it is jank however, the chambers consist more of being able to perform portal mechanics like gaining height off of two portals at a different elevation. this would not be a problem if the camera were not so disorienting, and the physics were so inconsistent. at some point in the test chamber it informed me that i could disable portal funnelling, or hold W while going through a portal for extra momentum. 

that being said, this game is the portal equivalent to mario 2: the lost levels (not to be confused for super mario bros. 2, which was just a retextured re-release of doki-doki panic, which is also not to be confused for doki doki literature club)",1,0

"Not done with MEGA difficulty yet but I saw this game had zero reviews and figured I'd toss my hat into the ring. This game opens HORRIBLY with unskippable cutscenes (Yes thats a me issue) and nothing but an open area and you cant even jump. Then you get to the first boss, and its fairly uneventful. Then something happens, braincells start firing and you're in the middle of a bullet hell fight desperately weaving between bullets and lasers. Theres a story with a twist but it's not insanely good, it works however. The main appeal is in getting better at the bosses, feeling confident, moving into MEGA difficulty and then, if you're truly unhinged, you try to get the no damage achievements. First playthrough ran about an hour and a half on champion difficulty. Don't miss this FREE hidden gem.",0,1

"Honestly the game would feel better without the lag. As some people would say it would be latency, this is literally the only game I have played that will have damage lag when attacking an enemy. You cant experience Expeditions as people are not on here much to do them and it even says in the description you can experience the game solo. You cannot do it all alone so that needs to be changed. The combat feels weird and it will take you awhile to get used to where your attacks go. Sometimes it feels like your attack should hit and it does not. Secondly, the abilities are linear as you just need to reach a level to attain them.

As this game isn't something I would recommend just yet, it does come with some decent ideas that make this game unique. While some games retain the skill tree for stats, this game has gear you equip that give bonuses to your damage for certain types of range etc. I think this is a good idea and I feel like they should expand on it. I do also recommend them looking into the servers as while some people are able to play and maybe able to enjoy the game, some will get disconnected and just quit without trying to play at all. Another thing to work on are the skills that require you to have teammates to use. Placing a bomb on a teammates feels a little off and since you are the damage as a fire user then you should be the one up close to attack and have the bomb on you so I feel like it should be placed on you instead.

The biggest complaint I have is just starting off, you go to the forest and immediately find a mob that is the same as something from Maplestory. Also the game just rips off the elements and how they use them from Avatar and makes it fight just like Maplestory does. AND BEFORE PEOPLE START SAYING A LOT OF GAMES DO THIS AND USE IDEAS FROM OTHER GAMES ---- TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE RABBITS IN THE FOREST AND TELL ME ITS NOT COPIED FROM MAPLESTORY! EASTER CHAIRS TURNED INTO MOBS!!!! As a game that had a decent new concept, completely and utterly disappointed you couldnt just make bad looking slimes and put them in. A game using ideas is one thing but literally you basically changed the look just a very tiny bit and put them in your game.

[h1][b]🎮 Gameplay:[/b][/h1]
[table][tr][td]🔶 Overdrive Escape is an intriguing, fast-paced shooter that offers a basic yet engaging gameplay experience. The game revolves around shooting, with minimal mechanics to consider. The neon theme commonly associated with fast-paced games is present here, aiming to create an adrenaline-fueled atmosphere. Your main objective is to clear out randomly generated rooms filled with enemies, as there is no specific storyline or overarching objective. However, at the end of each level, you have the opportunity to choose a perk, which serves as the game's only progression element. [/td][/tr][/table]

[hr]
[table][tr][td]🔷 The combat in this game falls somewhere between being mediocre and excellent. While the fluidity of the combat may not be top-notch, the fast-paced movement of the game manages to make it enjoyable. A wide variety of weapons are available in the game, which can be obtained as perks at the end of each level. However, the accuracy of the shots can be a bit frustrating, as there were instances where I missed despite having my crosshair directly on the enemy. Despite this minor drawback, the overall experience is mostly positive and enjoyable. [/td][/tr][/table]

[hr]
[table][tr][td]🔶 The only area where the game falls short is in its progression system. While there are currencies available for purchasing perks, it is not sufficient to provide a satisfying sense of progression. The initial few hours of gameplay may be enjoyable, but beyond that, the game fails to deliver further excitement or meaningful advancements. [/td][/tr][/table]

[hr]
[h1][b]📷Visuals and Audio:[/b][/h1]
[table][tr][td]🔷 The developers have attempted to create a neon-themed atmosphere in the game, but it falls short of expectations. The walls and other textures appear as plain colored blocks, lacking the desired neon aesthetic. There’s just not enough neon in this neon game! The weapons and their animations were the primary elements that contributed to the theme of the game. It is during combat that vibrant colors become more apparent, although there is room for improvement in the overall environment. However, one positive aspect worth noting is the consistent glitching effect throughout the game, which adds a cool touch. [/td][/tr][/table]

[hr]
[table][tr][td]🔶 The soundtrack of this game complements the neon theme and fast-paced gameplay perfectly. It sets the right tone and enhances the overall experience. However, a drawback is that there is only a single soundtrack in the game, which can become repetitive and annoying after a certain point. It would be greatly appreciated if the developers added at least one more soundtrack to provide variety and prevent monotony during extended gameplay sessions. [/td][/tr][/table]

[hr]
[h1][b]📝Main Pros and Cons:[/b][/h1]

[b]Pros-[/b]
[list]
    [*]Fast-paced gameplay.
    [*]Neon theme.
    [*]Combat is decent. 
    [*]The guns and animations look great
[/list]

[b]Cons-[/b]
[list]
    [*]The environment looks very basic.
    [*]Progression is very weak.
    [*]Gets boring very fast.
[/list]

[hr]
[h1][b]😇Honest Rating:[/b][/h1]
[table][tr][td]🔷 Overdrive Escape is not intended to be a game that you grind for extended periods. The gameplay experience typically lasts between 1 to 3 hours, which aligns well with the game's affordable price point. If you enjoy fast-paced combat, I would recommend giving this game a try. It offers an action-packed experience that caters to those seeking a short game with minimal mechanics. [/td][/tr][/table]

"Learn the rules and only play with a full group or friends elsewhere. Don't play more solo q games than you can report per day. This means only one game more often than not. The game has free game parts and paid content. The MMO starts out free, but then requires paid roles.

I won't talk about the paid content and MMO part below.

I played it years ago, and it was better back then! It can be fun, but only for a few hours without enough players.

A-AAAAA gameplay. They have many new roles! They also have clan wars! Some significant issues with paid options. Some annoying stuff, like for some reason each player gets 30 seconds in the first round. Self-reporting AFK players can really ruin the late game.
A-AA online. Wait times are long during odd hours.
-AAA matchmaking. They don't have separate rooms. I also don't think they match players of similar skill to each other. Games can be huge rollercoasters in a bad way.
-AAAA-A community. You know, Dota 2 is a fun place. Random players are, on average, weird at best. There are some really solid players out there, but they are rare, don't let that fool you. Some cheaters now... Some crazy flamers during the game. Several flamethrowers after the game. So many players are hostile to every minor mistake. I've never seen such shitholes in real life. Mafia is not a flamewar. The experience is even worse during peak or odd hours. Shitheads even annoy developers with their meaningless reports. Call the police. Never talk to assholes in the game.
-AAA developers obviously don't care about some issues with paid options. The pay to win is also here, which can even kill the game due to the small number of players!

All reviews with more than 30 hours of playtime are mostly nonsense. Few care about doing the right reviews...

"The AI is laughably easy to vassalize if their relations are neutral or higher.  They get a big fat -1000 to acceptance if they're wary or worse.  I...guess it works?  It seems we're supposed to vassalize our friends now, and the AI's do it with great eagerness to each other.  It's not uncommon for late game to center around 2-3 overlords and 1-2 federations (often composed of vassals).

The hyper relay is nice.  Orbital rings are decent and give options for specializing planets even further.  The catapult megastructure is pure meh.  If I wanted to end up in a random place on the other side of the galaxy, I'd...wait, I don't want that.

Holdings are extremely dumb.  A few buildings vastly outweigh the others in importance.  Do I want +2 loyalty per month (which lets me squeeze them for a % of their resource generation, including science or alloys), or do I want +12 science per month?  HMMMMM.

The new vassal types are a hot mess and should be avoided like the plague (except for maaaaaaybe the scholarium.  Maybe).  I always figured the point of a vassal was to benefit the overlord somehow, but these new ones are actually a DETRIMENT to the overlord.  Want a vassal who makes basic and special resources slightly better?  They get a penalty to their science, which is okay, and then the overlord has to pay them HALF of their science income to ""make up"" for it.  Wait, I have to pay my vassals now?  And something so valuable?  The bastion vassal is only slightly better, with a significant bonus to their ships, but they'll siphon off your resource production instead.

Now I understand why the AI throws itself at my feet begging to be vassalized as one of the new vassal types.  They're trying to parasitize me.  And that's this expansion in a nutshell.  Vassals get to ruin their overlord's economy and research now, which is also why you'll see some reviews complaining about the overlord becoming weaker than their vassals.  Fortunately, the old vassal types are still available, which raises the question of what these new ones add.

I'd say buy it for the orbital rings and hyper relay if you really want those, but beware the parasitic new vassals.",1,0

"This review is coming from a big fan of Cosmos Bit. Ultimately, I had fun but I think it’s worse than it’s predecessor. I recommend it with some caveats -  a few tweaks would make it much better. 

It is a very combat focused Metroidvania. Basically you are just clearing rooms of enemies to find the next save point, which gets a bit repetitive. It CAN be tricky sometimes to survive, and that tension is the main thing that keeps the game engaging.

One of the game’s main weak points is the bosses - they only have one move and are super easy to cheese (there’s always a safe zone to just camp in). The EDM dance music for these fights also really makes them a low point…

My biggest complaint though is the exploration and overall linearity. The only reward for searching nooks and crannies are digital trading cards - basically just a picture. This really should be tweaked - give a higher jump, faster movement, new attacks, etc. I also think a map redesign to allow multiple paths forward instead of one critical path would help - it only vaguely feels like a Metroidvania at this point.

 The pixel art is quite good, and lives up to its genre forefathers. It also is a good bang for you buck - it took me 6.5 hours to get 100%. I think the game has a lot more potential, a few tweaks really would make it an easy recommendation, but it remains to be seen if the dev decides to implement any changes.",0,1

"This game is disturbing, and I'm glad it is.

Media elevates itself when it has a worthwhile story to tell, or when it shares uncomfortable truths, even more when it makes the viewer/player feel something.  Even if that's disgust about what's happening on the screen.
This game follows two vulnerable women who get wrapped up in a situation they can't control. On one hand it's easy to say that they brought it on themselves, on the other hand, they're dealing with experienced and organized manipulators.

Graphically, this game is OK. It's not the best looking game out there, and specially the animations can use some work. As an example; Male orgasms are comical, to say the least.

At one point, after a particularly heavy scene, the game tries to remind you that you're playing a game. It's a comical relief moment with a 1960's batman cameo. Personally, I think this misses the point.  When Cece had a similar moment in Leap of Faith, it was a 4th wall break that showed Cece using a ""peek"" dialog option the MC, as if she were playing the game from her perspective.  
The batman cameo isn't tongue in cheek and actually raises the question if the MCs are still in touch with reality or not, or maybe they're having a fever dream.",0,1
"A nice piece of DLC which is held back by the amount of content offered for the price. The DLC features a new campaign alongside new splatoon-esque battle mechanics as well Akechi and Kasumi as new party members. The campaign is about as good as the main story in terms of writing (not very good), but the new battle mechanics are a great shakeup of how you usually play and Kasumi and Akechi both feel very unique compared to rest of the thieves (Akechi especially). However, you are probably only going to get about 3 hours of playtime in the campaign from this pack so the $26 price tag is honestly completely ridiculous. Also cashgrabby Day 1 DLC like this is gross. I'd only recommend it if its ~50% off. Atlus should have either made this cheaper or worked on it for a few more months before releasing it.",1,0

[h1] In-Depth [/h1]
[h3] Story, Gameplay & Basics [/h3]

In The Legend of Santa (TLoS) we are going to take a little sleigh ride with Santa Claus and his reindeer. After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.

TLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595

Similar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or ""save states"". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still ""annoying"".

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]

We are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.

It would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.

[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]",0,1

"Game seems interesting, but doesn’t tell you where to go or what to do, which would be fine if there was a community/wiki, which there currently isn’t. More players would be cool; other than that it seems very grind heavy. The first few quests are all about killing 20-40 monsters of the same type, with 1-2 damaging abilities. If you’re not in a group it takes time and some dodging but isn’t hard. Items don’t drop very often so save your money.

Hint: get around 200 coins and use the slot machine. A lot. If you do you can get some items that make coins appear on hit which greatly increase your money farming rate.",0,1

Another way you could have really driven this DLC pack home is having at least one of two new populations: drinkers and non-drinkers. The drinkers would be more attracted to restaurants with high selection of alcohol and it would repel non-drinkers. You could have also had new specialist designations of bar and juice/mocktail bar (requirements could have included 20 custom drink recipes on the menu), the mocktail bar wouldn't be allowed to use alcohol.",0,1

EDIT: Can confirm one bug so far. Cabalite Warrior (your starter infantry unit) does not get Plasma Grenades when you get the upgrade. On the other hand Wyches (melee infantry) get it instead even though they are not listed in the tool tip. 
Hey at least it's not as crazy as that Adeptus Mechanicus bug where cities were not giving loyalty penalty. 
I'll update if I find more bugs.

EDIT 2: Found another bug. Game consistently crushes if you use Haemonculous skill Twisted Animator. This one is pretty big as the ability to heal Wracks is core for maintaining the front line early game. 

At this point I suggest waiting a week or 2 for the devs to patch things up.",0,1

"------------------------------------------------ First try
Perhaps one day I will receive the items in the pack i bought. Amazon still working on the issue for more than a week with no approximate dates of resolution. In the end they will probably tell me ""they are sorry for inconvenience"". Despite the fact I have paid money, steam sent them, Amazon got them and i need to wait more then a week perhaps until they resolve some issues with that.
Do not buy it or else you would risk stuck like me with their(Amazon) tech support in which I would do a better job than them at this point. I ll update the review when this will be solved. If it would be.

20.03.22 Still not resolved

27.03.22 Three weeks, still not resolved. But it moved in a quite ridiculous/hilarious way. I ll update later once it will end if someone is interested.

29.03.22 So, apparently during the past 3 weeks and 6-7 different Amazon tech support operators, only the last two were able to tell me that they refunded the pack the same day it was purchased and they told me in context: ""it was the Steam issue,we can not help. Sorry...
 You are still here? Fock off mate."" (They said it in context, so not literally like that)

I was not even mad. The level of competence at the Amazon Lost ark support is very low I was able to comprehend it during all these past weeks. I just started to laugh hysterically. 
I directed it to the Steam support where they said in a matter of hours ""we got u. It will be solved soon.""
 So the issue will be resolved in one two days from now on I assume. Since I have not got the pack or my money back.

It was not an Amazon's fault I agree. But they told me that THE PURCHASE WAS REFUNDED THE DAY IT WAS PURCHASED only after THREE WEEKS of constantly chasing them almost every day. Disgrace, that is all I can say.
 
As for the Steam, the moment I told them about this issue they have not sent me away like a stray dog. They replied quite fast during the weekends, understood the issue and kept me updated. Also, I told them this once. So, thank you members of the Steam support for helping me. After my experience with Amazon tech support I have started to appreciate a good one.

----------------------------------------------- Second try
Continuation of the story, steam has refunded the money after which I tried to buy the pack again. This time the transaction details have not reached them(Amazon), I made a refund again. But i am not going to play lost ark ever again while it is published by amazon. I have had enough of this shit.
It is a shame, I really liked the game. Well... sometimes it happens I guess. They still have good delivery of actual items. But they are decades away from the level of decent digital products publisher. They have clearly no idea how to manage digital problems inside the game unless it is a common issue which any of us can solve. e.g. file verification, unlink-link amazon account from steam. Good luck to anyone else who have uncommon types of problems in the game. 
You really will need it.

During the course of several amazon support sessions I made a screenshots as a proof. I could not make this story up , it is very much real.
Beware, most of them are highly incompetent. Not all of them but the majority of them. And always make a template of the problem in Word or notepad since you have to speak about it all over again in the details next time you would contact them. Hopefully it would help some of you.",1,0
"The Greyhill Incident

What a shame.

I love Sci Fi games it’s by far and wide my favorite theme, I love Greys as the idea of them I find more chilling than the likes of xenomoprhs and of course I love Alien abduction stories [dont kink shame me]

So as you can imagine I’ve been folowing The Greyhill incident for a while as the screenshots are glorious and artisticly well done and everything about it screamed AA game with talent and lets be honest it’s rare now we get a AA or AAA horror game even if this year has a decent amount coming compared to other genres? it’s sparse.

[h1]First Impressions[/h1] 
I'm familiar with Elzzup (EZ) because I've played the game before on a website, or so I thought until after checking out the Discussion boards. Although it's practically the same puzzle game, it isn't made by the same team that made Unpuzzle. This is a matter I'll return to later on, but I have to wonder about the ethical, or even possible legal repercussions, behind this title. 


[h1]Gameplay[/h1] 
Each level of EZ looks like a completed jigsaw puzzle, with the pieces interlocked with each other. The objective is to find pieces that can be removed from the board, opening up more pieces that can be taken away, until you've swept the board clean. At first, it'll be as simple as finding pieces that are either completely blank or only interlock with one other piece, meaning it can be pulled away. Over time though, the complexity increases, as there may only be one piece you can remove at any given time. Sorting out that correct piece can take some work, but will start unraveling the rest of the board. 

Throughout the tutorial level packs, new mechanics will intermittently be introduced, such as exploding pieces, symbols, and ties that connect pieces together. Using a simple level to demonstrate how these new mechanics work, the game lets you play a level or two clearing these pieces before mixing them in with the other kinds. Typically, it isn't any single mechanic that's too difficult to figure out, but it can get complicated when there's layers to work through. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3055008928
[h1]Controls[/h1] 
In my own mind, I think of removing the puzzle pieces as flicking them away from the board instead of carefully pulling them off. Because of that, when it doesn't snap the way I expect, it slightly perturbs me. More often than not though, it responded well to my mouse controls, and went the direction I intended. 


[h1]Story[/h1] 
There's no story elements present in this game. With the puzzle mechanics in mind, coming up with something would be pretty convoluted, so I can see why the developers wouldn't have bothered. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3055008559
[h1]Visuals[/h1] 
Considering how basic the game is, I'm surprised that the images didn't look more smooth and crisp when I booted EZ up. I thought that the font and pictures looked somewhat rough, and almost out of focus, for some reason. Additionally, when I tried changing the options so it wouldn't be full-screen, it didn't resize to fit my monitor properly. There weren't any other choices that seemingly would make any difference, so you're stuck with the game's lackluster visuals. 


[h1]Sound Design[/h1] 
Although there's music, the default settings have the volume set too low to hear it well. After readjusting it, I was better able to enjoy the music that plays. I believe there's a couple of songs that play continuously, as I never noticed a substantial change in the tempo, tone, or rhythm during the same gaming session. It suffices for background tunes while you play a puzzle game, as it's not too distracting, but I think more could have been done. Why not set up a unique track for each level pack? 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3055009167
[h1]Pros[/h1] 
🌟 The boards could have been made overly large and frustrating, as a way to increase the difficulty. Thankfully, none of them get too out of hand. 
🌟 With all the mechanics available, it helps change up the puzzles without becoming too predictable.


[h1]Cons[/h1] 
❌ The red herring level pack is a pain in the neck because it's the same gimmick over and over again. Just call it the arrows level pack, as it's almost the only special piece that was used. 
❌ You can't save your progress in a stage partway through clearing it. I fail to see why that wasn't an included feature. 
❌ Difficulty can fluctuate in odd places, as I found some of the tutorial stages more complex than the full levels. 


[h1]Tips[/h1]
🔍 Often, there's a couple of edge pieces that you can remove without much hassle. However, at times you'll need to start by moving or adjusting pieces in the middle and using explosive ones to make some space. 
🔍 There's no penalty for checking whether a piece can be removed, and it's sometimes helpful to find out what's preventing a move you think should be available. 


[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1] 
Considering the volume of games that exist nowadays, it's not odd to find titles that are obviously inspired by earlier works. However, even if there's similar mechanics, you still expect core aspects to change significantly, such as level layouts, the visuals, story points, and so forth. EZ is a replica of the game Unpuzzle, at least in regards to all the puzzle mechanics. I wouldn't imagine the specific board layouts are exact copies, but I didn't do a side-by-side comparison either. Coming up with the unique mechanics would have been the more difficult part though. 

I'm no legal expert, and examples like Sudoku bring another twist to the idea of what aspects of a puzzle game you're allowed to use freely or not. Personally, the original game is so similar to what's being offered here that I find it a rip-off. Only time will tell whether there would be any sort of dispute between the original game's developers and EZ, but I'm against using someone else's work so brazenly. Plus, after finishing the final level pack, it comes across like that was the developers' own idea, and wasn't very fruitful since it only used one mechanic. Although I technically enjoy the game because it's a copy of another's work, I recommend supporting Unpuzzle instead of EZ.

"[h1]a Literature disguised as an Eroge[/h1]











[hr]

Here's an actual review and my problems with the localization. As an Asian.

The localization of jokes and memes are weird for me.
Too much localization for American audience.
For example:  I've never, ever seen the word ""Bazinga!"" in my life.
I never watched The Big Bang Theory, How am I suppose to know?

Some of the jokes could just beat around the bush but instead:
They translate the joke from [b]""Yaruki, Tenki, Misaki"" (やる気, 元気, 美岬)[/b]
(Google Translated to: [b]""Motivated, Energetic, Misaki""[/b])
The jokes here is Misaki (The one who said this) in the game she had a pretty shallow character (nobody knows she's here/there type of character), 
so she came up with a joke of tried to named 3 words that ends with the sound ""Ki"" to make her character more noticeable and more cheerful, she just wants the attention that's it.
Here's the translation line: [b]""#AllInForMisaki!""[/b], yes, this is the actual line in game.
What is this suppose to mean? I won't ever bother to imagine someone saying this in real life.

I don't always hate zoomer meme localization like this, 
I loved Sankaku Renai: Love Triangle Trouble, and that game is even worse than this. But I loved it for that. 
This game however, many of the jokes aren't even making any sense to me most of the times.

I have a feeling that this localization aren't going to aged very well, with all the slang and jokes that are sometimes aren't even in the original line. The Misaki joke above does says a lot about her character even if you  haven't read the game and I could actually imagined someone in real-life would make a joke like this, the localized one was just pure cringe like isn't Hashtag jokes dies off like 5 years ago? No one laugh at them anymore c'mon.

One of the few reason I gave this game a recommend is that, The story, the main Ideology and the lore are very good hence I review it as a [b]Literature[/b], even the characters are all memorable and I also wanted to play NUKITASHI 2 too.

I felt really disappointing at this localization.
So please Shiravune, consider re-translate this game.",0,1
"I came in expecting a collection of games, and what I got was a collection of games, fiction, interactive art, experiments, and sometimes just... vibes. While some games---or experiences I guess---are more technically impressive, polished, or even just longer than others they overall embody a messy, emotional, beautiful, meaningful, and often queer experience. As the kids say, it's hashtag relatable.

I ended up playing every game in one sitting and only learned afterwards that the intention was for the player to do a pull or spread once a day or so. I don't regret it but I also don't recommend it, though I can see myself getting frustrated if I did that because some games are much longer than others and it would mean that while I would spend 5 minutes in one session another would take a half hour.

Instead of reviewing each individual game, I'll just list my five favorites and why I like them without spoilers: Hierophant. Empress, Emperor, Magician, and Tower. Hierophant won me over with a very unique and beautiful art style, though the story also helped a lot. Empress and Emperor were both just Really Solid Games with great mechanics and execution, and while I could honestly see them as ""full length"" games they were also just perfect in length and didn't overstay their welcome, plus, once again, they both told great stories. Magician and Tower were probably the least interactive of the bunch but they stand out in art, audio, and especially the stories.

So yeah, many of these games tell great stories. There were a few that were lighter on the fiction (especially one that's an arcade score chaser) but even they had worldbuilding and themes and vibes. Overall these games all want to tell you a tale, and I found that almost all of them succeed.

There were some issues I had with this anthology, though. I felt that a few games were a bit longer than they needed to be and overstayed their welcome. I encountered some technical issues: most noticeably I could not run one of the games and another had a gamebreaking bug that made it impossible for me to progress. This leads me to another issue I had with some of the games: it makes sense that most games are short enough that they don't provide a save/continue feature, it is frustrating when a medium sized game doesn't have it so if someone had gone wrong I had to replay the whole thing.

Out of the 22 games I finished (or ""finished"" in the case of the endless games) all but 6 of them. As mentioned before, 2 games I couldn't play / didn't finish due to bugs. There were 2 that I gave up on because the in game explanations weren't really enough for me to figure out the game, and 2 that I quit halfway due to difficulty. I do plan on going back to the bugged game and 2 of the others because I really enjoyed the time I had with them. So overall I've enjoyed 19/22 games in this anthology (and maybe 20 once I see if I can fix the can't start game problem) which is a VERY GOOD ratio. Like, when was the last time I even enjoyed more than 3/8 games in a bundle?

"Take the thumps down recommendation with a grain of salt. It's really not that the game is bad, runs poorly or looks terrible. 

The reason I asked for a refund is because the gameplay didn't attract me personally. In all fairness, it does a fantastic job in recreating the Dark Souls feeling. Both in terms of gameplay, as well as aesthetics and in ambiance. 

The problem here is that the Dark Souls gameplay does not necessarily translate well in VR. I felt that I was hacking away at enemies without doing much impact. Dark Souls shines in its character building and tough gameplay. In VR however, I want to get catharsis from becoming physically better in the game (i.e. learning how to reload faster in H3VR) and not from hacking away because my character having better points.

"""Meh"" or ""ugh"" would be the appropriate improvisatorial adjective here.

This game is pretty contrasting in the things it does well and poorly in my opinion. The good are all the bits where it attempts to be simple, whereas the mediocre are everything else. 

The enemies are the highlight in this game; they're simple and follow a distinct pattern that requires the player to deal with them in a unique way. Because they're simple yet quite expressive fighting multiple at once feels quite good and dynamic. They hazards are generally well communicated too, like incoming strikes having a clear recognizable particle cue. Unfortunately the game suffers a bad case of the ""just run by them"", which is addressed in the small arena sections. The latter are consequently also the most challenging part of a run.

Then comes the core gameplay loop, which starts strong but starts to deteriorate in its confusion really rapidly. You have your standard melee strike and a ranged option which empties a resource generated by the first. Simple formula. Worked in the past, works here. You also have a dash with some i-frames and a perfect ""evade"" when close to the enemies' active frames. Again proven formula, works well. On top of that the player has two forms of consumables and an ability on a cooldown. Here things start to show the first signs of deterioration in the design. The game offers ZERO urgency outside the arenas, which means cooldowns are *rewarding* defensive and slow playing. You have the original ""ranged option only available when first getting into melee combat"" copied, which is designed exactly to battle this issue, and then you make the mistake anyway with abilities on cooldowns? Remarkable.

The consumables don't really compliment the game and feel more like a ""free out of jail""-card. I'm unsure what exactly was intended with them but they're fairly bland.

The melee combat feels BAD. Like actually outright bad. Animations are way slower than they should be, making the game feel unresponsive and clunky. But worse yet: weapons have massive deadzones. The most obvious examples are the weapons that have *no upward strike*. I complained about this in the demo and instead of fixing it they added it as ""roguelite element"" (further reinforcing what absolute cancer this genre is to indie developers). The consequences are that some enemies fall perpetually in the players deadzone, forcing them to awkward hop around and try to hit them with a directional attack that isn't suited for the job. Flying enemies and those sticking to the geometry are a nightmare to fight because of this.

Then there are the roguelite elements. This is the part where we go beyond bad in my opinion. The roguelite elements manifest themselves twofold: linear progression by collecting resources and crates containing upgrades and weapons. The first are part of the hub area, the latter lootboxes you can find in the map. Both of them are extremely invasive to the pace of the game. Just cleared a room with a lot of flair and speed? Hold up, gotta investigate this loot-box and pick my random boon for a minute. Momentum gone. And it happens constantly. Hub areas pretty much always suck so I don't really need to explain myself there. They're just an inferior menu to waste more time than necessary.

Because the game needed linear progression for whatever reason the maps sport a wealth of resources used for meta-progression. Resources in the form of coins and upgrade orbs. Some lootboxes contain an option: a meta-progression blue orb or something you would actually want to make the game fun? Brilliant. Punish the player for having stupid meta progression.

But the game goes even further by making the boons, random small perks you can obtain, extremely poorly designed. Almost a third of the boons I've seen REWARD bad playing. ""You get hit you get X"", ""if an enemy hits you you get Y"". WHY? Why REWARD the player for not playing the game properly? Even by roguelite standards this is dumb, and that's a big insult in my eyes.

The whole game is just another shining example of roguelites being perceived as this free ""look mom i designed a game xd""-crutch that indie developers fall for by the dozen. Almost everything bad about it originates from the fact that it didn't just double down on the fundamentals. It had to be another crappy roguelite, because indies must make roguelite games.

"Gameplay wise, this game is flawless. The combat is fun, simple, with enough variety to not make it stale. The movement is smooth and feels nice, and I like the core mechanic of how your health works. My problem with this game lies purely in technical and audio. If you are able to overlook technical and audio problems, then feel free to play the game, if not, maybe read this first.

My first problem with the game, as I loaded in, is that there's no resolution or quality settings. Quality settings, I can overlook, but resolution, I cannot. Having to play on my non-native resolution is not a great experience, and really takes away from the experience from me. If the developers see this, please add resolution settings.
My second problem came as a result of the audio. I'm wearing headphones, and the audio would constantly cut in and out from one ear to the other, making it incredibly irritating for my ears and was very unpleasant. This happened with all cutscenes, and some of the memories. Also, I would like to point out that the voice acting, for some of it, isn't exactly great, either. It could be just because of the lack of audio quality that makes it sound worse than it is, but most of the memories sounded very terrible. The story was pretty nonsensical, but honestly, I preferred the actual gameplay over anything else.

Overall, for a student project, fantastic. Loved the gameplay, I just wish that the technical issues get fixed so others are able to enjoy this short game without issue.",1,0

"TL;DR: If you have good specs and like making custom content in VRChat or NeosVR, this game is crack. If you're coming from NeosVR, you already know it's crack. If you're simply looking for a casual social experience like VRChat, or have very weak hardware, I would come back in a month or so after the developers improve performance and the community whips up more content. And I mean that, do seriously come back, the potential here is mental.

--------------------------

I must preface this with saying that I am a mute in these types of social games. I play these types of games for the secondary social fulfillment of ""people-watching"" rather than direct interaction and making friends like most people on these games, and I rarely attempt to begin interactions myself. However, I feel like that doesn't change much about my experiences with Resonite specifically, as Resonite is a lot more than just it's social interactions, unlike its competitors.

I really want to like this game, but I feel that I, personally, showed up too early to the party. I want to tell my cautionary tale so you can know yourself whether or not you're too early as well.

Please don't misunderstand the thumbs down on this review, this game has UNIMAGINABLE potential to stand toe-to-toe with VRChat given sufficient community support. This review is intended to be a ""thumb in the middle"" -- the game is awesome, but it's just not ready for the average player quite yet.

Unlike VRChat, which is first and foremost a VR GAME with modding tools, Resonite is a VR ENGINE with social game elements. Since the game just came out as of writing this review, there's still not much to do if you are not already intimately familiar with creating custom content for VRChat or NeosVR, mostly just watching in awe what others are capable of doing. Publicly available avatars are especially lacking currently -- unlike VRChat, you do not have the ability to clone another person's avatar, given that the user allows it (to my knowledge, at least), and if you don't have a personal model saved to your hard drive pre-rigged and ready the moment you make an account, you're unlikely to find an avatar you're truly satisfied with right now, though that's rapidly changing as of even last night. If you don't know the intricacies of avatar creation either you're better off not trying until you've done it correctly a few times in VRChat or NeosVR, since it seems every time you import custom content (textures, 3d models, etc.) and then use it for something, it is automatically uploaded to your account's cloud storage on Resonite servers -- which for standard users is only 1GB. I am not aware of any ways to access this storage, let alone clean it out. I failed to upload an avatar one time, and because of that I have seemingly permanently lost 2% of my account's storage, which is pretty scary considering my interest in the creation tools Resonite provides.

All of my social experiences on Resonite have been relatively positive, at least in relation to its direct competitors. At best, people are genuinely wholesome and understanding and incredibly interesting to be around. At worst, encounters can be undeniably uncomfortable and awkward, but the people have good intentions. The way avatar interactions are programmed into Resonite allows people to be a lot more... grabby, some could say ""pully,"" with others, given their avatar has the functionality to manipulate other player's avatars. There is an option to disable physical interactions, but I have not had personal experience with what that specifically means or if it mitigates interactions like this.

The most fascinating part of Resonite for me is the ProtoFlux in-engine scripting system. After finding the owner of a world programming the world we were all in, all around us, in real time, I went into my personal world and spent the overwhelming majority of my playtime trying to use ProtoFlux to make anything at all. I failed, but not for a lack of trying. There is currently a notable lack of documentation on how ProtoFlux is used outside of several-year-outdated tutorials for NeosVR's own visual scripting tools that ProtoFlux is built on top of, despite there being a wiki link in the default home which currently 403 errors you when trying to access it. With how it resembles more of a direct interface with the game engine itself rather than the more limited scripting capabilities you see for modding other games, lack of documentation is a death sentence even for someone like me who is a current game design student; doubly so for those who feel no intrinsic desire to tinker and learn and break things. There are easy to use tools for making simpler objects and doing things like changing materials, colors, and gluing objects together -- think the Toolgun in Garry's Mod -- but if you want to make anything that has functionality, you're either going to need to do the trial by fire, wait for documentation, or try to borrow someone away from their work to ask for mentorship or advice, which many, myself included, are not comfortable doing.

So the people are nice, the tools are powerful albeit undocumented, and the game lacks avenues to personalize, but because the game just came out. Why is the review negative?

Because I can't run this game for shit.

Admittedly, I have to fight to play most VR games due to having very outdated, absolute minimum requirements hardware to run VR -- think a GTX 1660 Ti. I am very used to sub-90fps, even sub-60fps framerates in most VR games, and I'm not phased by low framerates whatsoever. However, even with weak hardware, in very populated lobbies, I can still average anywhere from 45-60fps in the usual VRChat world. The only time I can manage 60fps in Resonite is when I am alone, inside a completely empty void, and even then I pretty regularly stutter down to 50fps. The moment I join a world with 3 or less people, the framerate tanks to 30fps. More than 3 people? 15-20fps. If these 3+ people are doing... literally anything at all, or if a particularly complex object has been spawned in by a player, I'm lucky to be able to get a couple seconds of stable gameplay every 10 seconds. I am running the game off of an external hard drive, and I can imagine that has impact on the performance, but when the game chugs this hard in a small-sized lobby to such degrees that people's voices warp and cut out and I physically cannot move without freezing for seconds at a time, I don't know how much of that can be attributed to not being on an SSD, but the game undeniably becomes entirely unplayable. When I can run HEAVILY MODDED Skyrim VR, also off of a hard drive and a GTX 1660 Ti, better than I can a brand new SOCIAL GAME, I feel that is a significant performance issue that needs to be addressed. I don't say this as a dig to the developers; I understand the history of this game and its predecessor NeosVR, and how both games are the homes to, generally, power users with beefy PC towers, higher-end headsets, custom self-made/commissioned everything for VR, and a desire to break shit for hours until they understand how to cast magic. However, there is a significant, damning difference between ""budget setups CAN run the game, albeit poorly"" and ""budget setups CANNOT run the game at all,"" and until these performance issues are addressed I can't see myself indulging in the social aspects of the social game out of fear of my computer melting. And if I can't play the social game socially, even as a people watcher, what's the point in learning ProtoFlux to make gizmos that I can't share with others, or maybe even use myself?

I'll be closely following development updates on the game in the coming months, and I plan on updating this review as things change and I play more in the future, but as of right now I simply can't recommend it for the casual player or anyone running weak hardware.",1,0
"If you're not familiar with MDickie, here's what you need to know: MDickie does not make good games. He has never made a good game. He's essentially the Niel Brien of game design. He's got an overinflated ego (the guy who did Dan McNeely in the Trapped flash games and some other characters in Godlimations' other flash games actually did a dramatic reading of MDickie's memories. Unfortunately it was DMCA'd by none other than MDickie himself but it was a neverending source of hilarity while it was still up) and the things he brags about are hilarious, such as making the #1 wrestling game for the Ouya (spoiler alert: it was the only wrestling game for the Ouya). That said, this game is worth a try for the sheer insanity of it. 

From a gameplay perspective, it's awful. The combat is clunky. the sheer perfection the game expects when it comes to making classes on time is stupidly strict. You have to skip through all the dialogue as fast as possible because MDickie in his infinite stupidity made it so time doesn't pause during dialogue so if you don't your class will most likely be over by the time one character finishes one line of dialogue.  The controls are unbelievably stupid. I have never seen such a terrible control scheme in my life. 

Visually, the game is awful as well. Somehow despite making games since the 90s, MDickie still hasn't figured out how to make characters' mouths move or characters blink. To compensate for his inability to do what even novice developers have figured out how to do, their eyes sink into the back of their heads and they have mouth textures pasted on their faces while talking. 

That said, it's worth checking out for the sheer insanity of it. Much like MDickie's other games, the AI is schizophrenic and bipolar as hell. One moment a character could be hugging you and acting friendly towards you only to immediately punch you in the face and suplex you. At one point I went to my crafts class and as soon as the class began, the teacher started hugging my character while criticizing me for not bringing the required materials to class. At another point I went home after school to find some random girl in my house using the toilet. As soon as she got up she started making out with my character. After that she punched me and I ended up beating the crap out of her and putting her in the hospital. 

Ultimately, it's a terrible game but it's a fun game to screw around with for the sake of the insane stuff you'll experience with it. I wouldn't say it's worth $15 though. Wait for it to go on sale for $5 or less.",0,1

"This game seems like it could be really interesting, but sadly in its current state it's not really playable. First big thing is the FPS in it is capped really low so everything is constantly stuttering. But you can push past that. I got to the point of destroying obstacles with the stone baby, but ultimately died due to the attack and wasn't able to dodge, after that every time I respawned, I fell out of the world(assuming this happened because I would spawn inside of the stone baby.) There does seem to be some interesting lore from the small tidbits given in the intro and voice dialogue(which sounded pretty good). Overall, best of luck to the developer(s) in bug fixing and play testing, maybe in the future I'll try it again.

"I can't recommend it at this price, maybe wait for half off or larger sale event…

This is a single new campus with just two new courses and a handful of paranormal and ghost themed decorations. Quality wise it's just a theme change that functions the same as the rest of the game already does; with one minor exception: how you unlock new plots requires you level up enough students in the new course to ""fight"" a ghost which is just set an event timer and wait (and have enough trained students to do it). It's not a huge change, it just makes you increase that course level more than you might so you have less course points to spend on adding others for more variety. And you'll have janitors catching ghosts (instead of cleaning up meteors or catching invaders from other schools).

All of this would be fine if they hadn't set the expectation that for $10 you normally get 3 schools (or before that 3 hospitals in Two Point Hospital).

My only real complaint is that you're not getting value for money. The other DLC released was three times this size with three campus, half a dozen new courses, and more decorations for $10. By comparison this is one third the content for $6.

If you're addicted to the game and just buying whatever comes out, then you don't need to be reading reviews anyway. For everyone else, wait for a sale price, especially if you haven't even finished the other base game campuses yet.

"This Clan is extremely complex when compared to any previous clan implemented into the game, DLC or otherwise.

The roots system is quite interesting and unique, certain Roots having different effects depending where you plant them and tying it in with the research tree gives for a very unique lore focused perspective. I do feel like the removal of wood as a resource was intended to force you to spend your lore often to prevent you from snowballing, and it definitely slows you down in the beginning where wood is much easier to accumulate. But in practice, it allows you to focus your entire economy around lore and steamroll with more flexibility than other clans. Keep in mind, you can gain lore from: 

- Loremasters working at Runestones, Carved Stones, Ancient Graveyards, Circles of Stones and Relics of the Gods.
- Sailors by default, population size also gives a small increase (up to +5 trickle).
- Searching Ruins and their unique replacement for the scout.
- Various Technologies which either gift lore or improve the rate at which you obtain lore.
- The Altar of Kings and the Jormunr Relic.

With all this in mind, you can have several sources and depending on map generation, all of these can spawn on a single map and at least most of them will pretty consistently, allowing you to absolutely farm Lore if you play right. Farming one resource is always easier than having two separate resources unless the costs are extremely high. While early game it does feel tough, over time it quickly becomes easier. You do miss out on a lot of events and such by not having wood though.

But does the great plethora of abilities, the root system, their lore steamroll economy and other traits make them truly a powerhouse clan? I'm not sure honestly. It feels like they are much more complicated to play, but not any stronger and at times weaker than the other houses, particularly early game. The exception to this is that their unique victory condition does feel rather overpowered currently (after a certain amount of research, you gain a higher tier research option for 500 Lore that allows you to summon giant. With that giant, you will win if you decolonize 3 more regions. This lead to me winning a match that, yes I would have won anyway, but much faster and in a way that felt somewhat abrupt and undeserved. So they either feel too weak, or too strong, and neither of those situations feels good.

Overall, not sure how I feel about this clan yet. Feels too complicated for too little pay off . . . yet the victory condition hands you the win too easily.",1,0

"I was looking forward to this game. And it's actually alright, It's quite in-depth and has quite a few cool elements. For example building PCs is fun. But the whole game feels a bit too clicky. There's a lot of clicking everywhere. It doesn't feel intuitive when I have to keep relocating the main character between his bedroom and rented out mining room to make some change. A lot of clicking everywhere. Also, I couldn't really see an edit button? So when something new launches I can't just edit systems, I need to sell them and build new ones (unless editing is a thing and I just didn't see the option to do it). Building racks also takes a lot of clicking and dragging. And I get it, when I'm not building, I'm staring at the bitcoin price stats, so there is technically quite little to do in this game. It's fun for a bit, but I don't know if that justifies the price.
The story is interesting to some extent, but I feel like its reveal happens a bit too early. Uncertainty, would make this more interesting. For me personally it's missing more engaging gameplay and clicking lots of buttons all the time I don't really consider ""gameplay"".

I still recommend it, because I had fun for the time I've played. I just don't think I'd spend any more time, but your mileage may vary.",0,1

"This is like if Terry Davis of TempleOS fame made an MMO. I'm intrigued and deeply, deeply unnerved by the whole affair. The music goes from appealing to creepy, the art style is weirdly uncomfortable, the UI and controls feel like they were designed for fans of VIM. This game is like the sort of game that'd be in the background of a movie, one where they don't want to show a real game so they have the art department whip up something that kind of looks like a game. This is that game.

There's everything you'd expect in a space MMO, combat, PvP, trading, exploration, even corporations, but all of it feels so weirdly implemented, like it was added without knowing *why* a game needs those things. 

This game has a certain charm about it that keeps you playing, even though you don't know *why* you keep playing. It's lacking in any meaningful progression other than ""number goes up"", there's no ships to buy, no plot to follow, no reason to build stations, yet somehow you can't stop playing it. 

The dev has been working on this game, or precursors to this game, for near as I can tell two decades. This is the cumulative result of two decades of work and whilst I applaud him for the effort and sheer stubbornness, I'm just not sure I understand how it is as it is before us today.

I wholeheartedly recommend you try this game, just to peer into the strange, unsettling, confusing world of what is by and far the weirdest MMO I've ever played.",0,1
"How hard can it be to be able to edit the database en masse, whilst having all the perks of a tool like this?

But if you're looking for quick editing of item names and the like, forget it - you're still restricted to typing one thing at a time in a tiny box, like you're entering your town name in a Kairosoft game on Android in 2009.

The scenarios are rather boring and use either the ugly Class 158 or the ancient stuff from the ELAP, which might have been satisfying 11 years ago, but is a disaster nowadays. 

And come to think about it: €33,- is rather expensive for what you're (not) getting: for instance, why isn't the Sheffield light rail included as AI?

"My impressions video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6-k4T0WdMk

Hacking games are a genre I always feel I should love, but all of the ones I've tried either frustrate me, stress me out, or both. I can recognize why they're cool, but just can't enjoy them. DROP - System Breach defied that and turned hacking into more of an action game that still has the pressure of other hacking games, but doesn't give you time to focus on it.

The presentation here is simple, but effective. Everything is in a lo-fi pixel art style with great, synthy music. You play a hacker who takes jobs from a number of different organizations and slowly, uncover a simple, but intriguing story. There are a lot of missions with varying objectives and obstacles, which the game was still introducing new ones of multiple hours in. You have to move fast in these missions (rarely will they go over 5 minutes), but the game gives you the tools and controls needed to move fast. You'll often be under pressure, but you never sit idle long enough to start feeling the stress of that and losing your focus. This is a perfect game for short sessions when you don't have a lot of time, or you can dig in for a good while. I did both and enjoyed myself both ways.

It can sometimes be tricky to keep track of the various enemy types and tools you have at your disposal, but that's also kind of the point. Many other hacking games either make me feel lost or confused and this one never did that. It really feels more like a lo-fi action game than what many would call a traditional hacking game. It has provided a challenge at times, but I have found it not too difficult so far. At time of writing, I haven't finished it and a few reviews say the difficulty spikes to unreasonable levels near the end, so that might be something to keep in mind.

I've really been enjoying this and fully intend to finish it. If you like the idea of hacking games, but haven't found them too accessible for you, give DROP - System Breach a look.",0,1

"The game is out! I thought I would give my thoughts on the 2024 version. Full disclosure, I am a beta tester on this version, and am an unabashed fan of the game. 
Pro Strategy Football 2024 is a coaching sim, that allows you to take on the role of coach, calling plays on the field. And if that's your main interest, there are community mods with rosters and artwork from 1940 through current day, that either are or will be available shortly. You can replay real world match-ups from history, or play what-ifs that didn't happen.
If you want more, the game also allows for playing out an entire season through the playoffs, or even better, you can start a career and take a team through season after season. 
Career Mode:
While there are no financial aspects to the game, there is a fairly robust off-season that gives you (and your AI opponents) an opportunity to improve your roster from year to year.  
-There is a Free Agency phase and draft that allows you to put a franchise tag on one of your players who have declared as free agents. Then a short draft that lets you try to snag a free agent from other teams.
-Then there is a Rookie Draft, which is 7 rounds, so you can add youth and hopefully build for the future.
-Finally there is a Waiver draft, where teams draft for 3 rounds picking up players from other teams that have been cut previously. The waiver pool is persistent from season to season, with those players aging, improving(or not), retiring.

You have the ability to save box-scores,  play by play, and actual video highlights from every game ever played. In a career, 25 seasons in you can go back and watch highlights from say your season 3 championship game, or even a regular season game. And if you update your stadiums and uniforms throughout your career, the old highlights will show the season appropriate artwork. 

For the 2024 version, the above waiver pool/draft is a new feature. 
The career mode is now fully customizable, allowing for 1 to 16 conferences, and 2 to 140 teams. 
You can change coaches during a game from AI to human, any combination, whenever you want.
You can sim through a possession.
There is a Score Ticker that scrolls during a game, showing you the scores of completed and in-progress games around your league, and it's customizable. 
A lot of time was spent also on improving AI, from team management to play-calling.

This game gives you a nice American football experience on and off the field. With a ton of rule sets and customization, you can relive the glory day of seasons past, or flex your creative muscle and create and play in your own football universe. I started with PC football games as far back as the old Micro League Coaches Challenge, then on to the Front Page Sports series and not until this version did anything offer the fun and realism of those games. Add in the robust customization, this game is hard to beat. Highly recommended, with a great mod and user community.",0,1

"Honestly, comparing this to their previous console to PC ports ([i]coughs[/i] Dynasty Warriors 7 [i]coughs[/i]), I have to say Koei did a really good job of not f**king up the port this time.

Pros:
- 60+ FPS gameplay.
- Roughly 50+ hours of content.
- All WO3 contents for the price of under $12 (in my country currency).
- MOUSE SUPPORT? FINALLY THE FIRST TITLE IN THE SERIES WHICH HAS MOUSE SUPPORT.

Cons:
- Horrible controller support (seriously, did Koei even properly test the controller input before releasing WO3UDE on PC?). I had to turn off DS4Windows to be able to even use the controller properly, as the game suffers from what's called ""double input"", which have never happened to any other games that I played using a controller.
- Forced 30 FPS during in battle cutscenes. I wonder if this is intentional of if this is impossible to change. Nontheless I still enjoy the 60+ FPS gameplay.
- Keeping the same poorly translated English subtitles at a noticeable amount of lines whist Koei had like, 9 years? to fix this. I don't have much of a complain to this but you have the time and manpower to work it out though?

I'll still keep this as a recommendation though. Keep up the good work Koei.

"This review was initially framed for veterans of IB who have played the original and want to know if the Steam version is worth the price over the original, as well as if this version is the definitive version of IB. I will also remark on if new players should buy this version at the end of the review over the free version. This review is a bullet-point list of things better, mixed, or worse compared to the free version. If you are a new player, you can skip just to the conclusion to avoid spoilers.

[b]Exceptionally better:[/b]
-You can talk with Garry at any moment in almost every room (and with different dialogues depending on different location within the room, so a huge chunk of new dialogue). This is - by far - exceptional fan-service since one of the biggest draws for fans to buy an expanded version of games they've completed is to spend more time with characters they love, and you have that in spades with this version. Alongside Garry, Mary also has this expanded dialogue as well when she's in your party. 
-IB's dream (nightmare) sequence right after the end of the Grey Area is executed more artfully and a better and richer dream sequence overall.

[b]Better:[/b]
-So much level streamlining, rooms that did not need to be rooms are deleted and some puzzles are streamlined on unnecessary aspects (6 tile pieces instead of 12). Not all of this is better, but quite a bit are an improvement.
-Characters have better portraits, especially Mary who has a cute fang now when she's angry at you.
-The top-down pixel art is better overall, but there is some minor inferiorities here and there [spoiler](the blue dolls in the bunny room are slightly less intimidating than the free version)[/spoiler]
-True Exhibit picture tracking is streamlined across save files, so the game remembers which picture you've already seen not just from inside one single save-file line, but across all save files (as long as you saved).

[b]Mixed:[/b]
-The puzzles overall. Quite a few puzzles have been replaced for completely new puzzles and many original puzzles that were kept were streamlined in some ways. On the whole, I personally felt the new puzzles are easier than the old puzzles, either more obvious or just less steps, and I don't like this. The new puzzles are not as interesting as the old ones, but they are more streamlined and less prone to getting new players stuck on a step, but I don't mind if the player gets stuck on a good puzzle because it's ultimately worth it. [spoiler]The whole vent-logic of the rainbow pallet area is replaced with some snake and vent orientation puzzle which is less imaginative and clever for me.[/spoiler] Some players might prefer these slightly easier and more streamlined puzzles, but I don't.

[b]Worse:[/b]
-[spoiler]Grey Area escalation sequence, the new version is a scripted linear maze where you flee from a single painting compared to the free version where it is utter chaos with every monster coming to life at the same time and you have absolutely no idea where you are going. In this new version, Garry immediately points you to the exit before the monster chases you so there is no uncertainty, but in the old version it's utter confusion and panic since you don't initially know where to go and everything has come alive trying to kill you. This new version is so inferior to the old version it blows my mind that Kouri removed it, this is one of the tensest moments of the original game and now it's nowhere near as tense or memorable.[/spoiler]
-Excessive puzzle hints. In certain areas, not all, there are too many hints to be gained from just talking to your companion character, whether it's Gary or Mary. You will have hints all the way through to the finish line, Kouri doesn't want any player to be left behind which is noble in some regard, but I see great value in letting players get stuck and having to push themselves to figure it out. By getting stuck, the puzzles become a bigger achievement since the players had to work harder for the solution, so hints that guide through the entire puzzle undermine the satisfaction in a real way. This doesn't always happen, but it does happen. 
-Music. Kouri switched around which tracks are played during which scenes (some not all), and also replaced some tracks with completely new songs. This was never done in a way that improved upon the original free version, there was not a single switch or new song that was better than the track and scene matching of the original, so it's just overall worse.
-Rpgmaker Engine version. MV is a lot buggier than Rpgmaker 2000, so there will be a longer period of bug-crunching to make it as bug-free as the free version. I encountered a bug that forced me to restart the game once during my playthrough. There have been several patches now, so it should in theory be better.

[b]A lot worse:[/b]
-Sound effects. I am so sad that the very aggressive ""HWAA!!"" that the red headless statue shouts at you when it comes alive is removed and replaced with silence. Really Kouri? Why? That sound effect alone establishes the danger and urgency for running away from the monster so strongly for the game, and you removed or changed this central aspect of tension not just from the first red statue, but also for the black hands coming out of the walls and the red lady as well. This dilutes the horror so much, it was central for establishing tension inside the initial monster encounters and how could you possibly remove this sound effect? I am baffled that Kouri who created the original IB is the same person who made this remake that doesn't see the value of these sound effects.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] 
Overall, if you are a big fan of IB and have played the free version many times before, just the fact that you have so many new lines of optional dialogue with Gary should alone be enough to make you purchase the Steam version so I can recommend it to veterans who love and are passionate about the original game. 

But is this the Definitive version of IB? I would say No it is not because the puzzles, while more streamlined, are less rewarding and imaginative than the original and more importantly, the horror is inferior to the free version because of some decisions of redesigning events as well as removing certain sound effects that set the tension. The Definitive version is still the freeware version 1.07.

So for new players that have never played IB, the better experience is within the original free version so I recommend playing that over buying this. For veteran players, the game is worth it for the expanded time and dialogue with Gary and a nice trip down memory lane inside this beloved game. I would like to give a mixed review rather than a binary thumb up or down, but for the sake of new players I will thumb it down.

"It's incomplete. I can't describe it any other way. It has some growing pains it will likely go through in the near future. I think the first thing to address is my headset because it causes the most incompatibility with games I've seen so assume anything that relies on it (height, tracking, controllers, etc.) could just randomly have problems. That aside, some games work well on it, so I know it's possible.

(I think) headset related bugs:
-Sprinting it difficult to activate unless you're looking at your hands, likely due to camera positions + how it reads the up and down movement, I would've preferred a more accelerometer based approach but this might have been more reliable idk.
-The 'abxy' buttons are not mapped by default so dash and jump need to be mapped. I published my config, all it is is abxy mapped.
-Reaching over your shoulder or for your side weapons in difficult, they don't line up on my body.
-My arms/shoulders are like a second set of arms beneath my arms that meet at my hands, this wouldn't be an issue if they couldn't collide, but collision is important for realism so idk.
-Response to controller movement is average, which would be better if it didn't rely so heavily on it working.
-My height felt all wrong, I left it on auto but even when I set it manually, things felt off.
With WMR/Reverb G2 issues out of the way:
-The weapon rack had the executioner's sword off center, and it's trigger would prevent you from grabbing swords next to it even if your hand was essentially touching the other sword because it's trigger area is so large. 
-The ice magic staff I assume is meant to represented by the top diagram on the stone pillar but it's diagram is clockwise, just like the fire, when it's actually counter-clockwise for the spell.
-Dialogue is all but inaudible when not staring basically right at the character.
-Triggering the bell at the blacksmith is challenging.
-The tutorial has a boss, this boss is fun but nothing about the consequences of dying were explained (matter, weapons on the ground, potion loss, etc.)
-The way you are intended to move the panels when ordering at the blacksmith is unclear: can you grab it, or only slide it, why is it so hard to trigger? 

Now I've griped, let's talk about what they did right, which is what I'm very happy with and why despite what I mentioned above, I played for 2 and half hours without taking off the headset.
1) SteamVR. It works great, and binding adjument on the fly worked a charm. What buttons 1 and 2 were wasn't clear but everything worked so it's fine.
2) Game feel. I felt immersed, wanting to swing my sword with accurate and powerful blows (though the speed might not affect damage, idk). This is a game I can see myself playing again and becoming invested in the story and progression of.
2a) Magic. Very fun, balanced by limits on knockback, shields, and mana pool. At first I thought it would make it too easy but mana regen speed means that when your pool is empty, you feel more at ease if you pull out a sword or hammer to fight with while your mana regens. I've got the ice and fire staves and they have similar function-ish with great recognition of what is and isn't the right shape, only wish it worked vertically. Can't have your cake and eat it too, i guess.
2b) Weapons. With immersive combat comes a need for fun and varied weapons, and what better way to serve that than by giving that? You have axes, swords, hammers, daggers, spears, shields, and magic staves all of which have multiple variants to craft. Choose handle, blade shape, guard, etc. 
2c) Potions and materials. You lose all but your starting potions when you die (provided they are unused) but materials aren't kept with you. Both materials and potions are 'hidden' throughout the places you might engage in combat. Materials are for weapons, they are schematics (for the previously mentions weapon building) and resources like wood, iron, and gems. Potions are used to recover health and/or mana should you choose to use them. They can be found the same way as materials: as occasional drops or as loot/hidden treasure.
3) Skill tree and armor. I like that your armor is free and interchangeable depending on your build, just like resetting your perks is so you're very free to explore different playstyles. Health regen to compensate for choosing heavy armor? nice. things like that.
4) Switching it up. There isn't a time I've encountered (except when I died, all enemies respawn if you die, loot doesn't, go collect your corpse) that made me feel bored. I never thought about quitting because there was nothing different. The story doesn't force too much on you and it plays easily, keeping your interest the while time.
5) Menus. Pause is a thing (not): you can press your settings button and the game keeps going and you're still able to move. Accepting quests and interacting with the guide felt very natural. I especially liked the nod to accept.

Overall, I'd say they've got work to do, and not just for WMR. Bugs are common in a early access game and I really look forward to what this looks like in a few months when it's more mature. Overall, I recommend this game with the understanding that what you;re getting is still being worked on and it not done yet. Also. the herbalist looks weird (so does the old man, but that's just old people). To devs reading this, good luck, I can see you really care about making this a great game.",0,1
"It's more of a screensaver than a game. 

I like to put it on in the background and listen to peaceful sounds of nature while collecting achievements for doing essentially nothing.
Occasionally, I glance over to look at the adorable mushrooms and quietly contemplate the futility of existence.

Also, this 'game' uses an absurd amount of CPU for what it is and I have my suspicions that it's a crypto miner. ",0,1

"This DLC is fairly uninspired. Six missions in old locations. Paths seem to be somewhat random. Some interesting monologue. To be honest, there seem to be more effort spent on the intro cut scenes than actual content.",1,0
