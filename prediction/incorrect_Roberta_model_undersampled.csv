"There's a lot of polish missing on this game. The fullscreen option seems to not be remembered after a run, the tutorial doesn't auto-disable after the first run, shop upgrades cost 10 points, however you're blindly buying them due to the rewards being question marks. There's other things, but this is what comes to mind immediately.

Overall some work is still needed to be recommended, however the premise is fairly nice. 

Polish this up dev!

"Update: the lower difficulty makes it possible to finish the game. However, the unbalanced combat in the bonus mode is uplayable because of crucial drops that never happen and one type of enemy that is too strong and too fast for your weak axe.

Horror indie that ruins good first half with tedious second part that relies too heavily on shooting with limited resources. 

The game does not waste time. Scary things begin to happen straight away, and there are plenty of them. You will notice beings peering around corners, eerie dolls with bright red eyes tracking your every move, frightening noises, and so on. 

The graphics are excellent and there aren’t a lot of graphical issues. The optimization ensures that the experience is not hampered by errors or slow performance. Although the apartment don't give you much to work with because you're just exploring abandoned rooms that have been neglected for far too long, there are plenty of details that add to the creepy mood. 

The gameplay is typical. You must search rooms for keys and stuff that will allow you to progress. I like how the game doesn't waste your time and includes a handy function that highlights stuff with a red glow. Finding little keys in chaotic places would have been tedious without it. Plus, there’s only one code puzzle that couldn’t be easier. 

The game changes things up a bit in the second part. It takes place in the same apartment complex, but it turns dark and enemies start showing up. Although an axe can be used to take them out, its damage and range is so poor that a gun is far preferable. 

Overall, this whole section is ugly and unplayable. Since axe is pretty much useless against ridiculously spongy enemies, you rely on random ammo drops that rarely fall out of dead enemies. If that doesn’t happen, you’ll just have to die and repeat the same sections until you get lucky. Health drops are more frequent, but even this doesn’t help because most items restore very little and the game doesn’t pause when you open the inventory to heal. 

When I found myself surrounded by enemies without any resources, I had to return several minutes back. Or you can hope the enemy will just stand there. Thankfully, there’s an autosave feature that keeps saving at regular intervals. 

Of course, there are also boss fights that happen one after another. Right after you waste all bullets on the first boss. These fights take place in a very small room where it’s impossible to stay away from one boss with huge range and the second that is too fast and teleports. You're dead after a few hits. There are some bullets in the corner, but not enough to take them down. At this point I stopped playing. Unskippable cutscenes with every boss, small room, no resources, no time to heal... 

A shame. Because this is a single person's effort, it's always good to see when they don't cut corners. Too many developers simply include free assets that make the game unplayable. While there are some flaws, they don’t break the game. Throwable objects, for example, can sometimes clip through walls and disappear. And there’s one graphical issue where your shadow gains eyes and a mouth.

One potentially game-breaking bug does exist. If you die and alt-tab to desktop, the game loses its mouse cursor that prevents you from continuing the game. The only way out is to force quit.

This is probably a two-hour game. However, after completing the game for the first time, you gain access to a bonus mode, a wave-based shooter in which you must withstand an onslaught of enemies. This manages to make combat even worse becasue you're stuck in a dark with only an axe. Waves are random so you will die in the first one when you get those fast and cheap enemies. 

Achievement hunters will love this game. There are exactly one hundred achievements that are rewarded for almost everything you do or examine.",1,0
"Nearly the new max level and not at end game or pvp content yet here are my Pros and Cons.

Pros:
- Some nice UI changes which makes the player gear bar less cluttered
- Level cap of 65 (is rather quick to get)
- Mounts (a little tedious to level it up with the ""races"" but much quicker to get around) 
- Can mount WHILE MOVING
- lots more TP points
- More crafting levels to grind out, seems node spawns been decreased in time for some materials

Cons:
- Stupid ""Click / loot an item from a pile to complete a quest"" which only allows 1 person to click it before its timer resets and those timers normally 3-10 min.
- out of their control but the market value of items is very high as low player base with little mats didnt support the influx of  ppl returning
- Battle pass and Season Journey issues on launch ( cant claim)
- misc connection issues as expected
- misc quest bugs

"Honestly if i could give a neutral ""it was okay"" i would, but its not bad enough to warrant a thumbs down imo. i agree with most people, wait until you can get it on sale and don't spend the full $15 USD.

"I only played the 0 part of this series besides this one and, even though it is very weird to say in this context, the pt.13 is much worse than pt.0. Even though the gameplay remains identical (besides the new ""flashlight"" gimmick which btw was a complete miss imo) the charm of the first game is gone here. 
I actually quite enjoyed the pt.0, the Halloween theme looked pretty so wanted to try this one. But what made the first game so charming and not aggravating was it's level ""structure"" - the levels were arranged in such way that complicated levels followed the easier ones and it made the game feel satisfying and completable. This part is just a bunch of really hard levels smooshed together (once again, the ""flashlight"" mechanic doesn't make it any more fun). 
You don't feel like you're having a good time anymore, you feel like ""I wish I could complete this asap and be done with it"" which honestly sucks comparing this to the bliss I've felt playing pt.0.
Here I had to use hints about 20 percent of the game, though I managed to complete the pt.0 with about 10 hints in total, probably less.

"This game has a cozy somewhat relaxed feel. There's crafting, building, growing and foraging all right there. However, it does seem somewhat buggy still. Mail requests seem like they'll either show up or they won't randomly, and recipes you gather may or may not show up for you to actually create. I'm hoping with some time these little bugs will smooth out. Otherwise, i find it very fun to do quests or side quests, farm and explore.

Edit: due to the patches and bugs that keep coming up, I'm struggling to progress any further in  the game. As such, I definitely couldn't recommend this to anyone until they fix it.",1,0

"Finally, I can goop survivors with my big, meaty balls!

On a serious note though, the killer is more geared towards a chase playstyle at the moment than a trap based. There is no penalty for removing EMP'ed pods and immediately replacing them with a fresh one, so personally I use them during chases to close the distance and annihilate pallets. Did I mention their overclock ability can insta-destroy pallets and make windows almost irrelevant? Yeah, unless survivors play REALLY well around a pallet you'll be eating them up and leaving them with no breathing room for the entire match.

Yeah, don't play the Singularity expecting optimal pod placements and area denial like Hag, EMPs are way too lenient and frequent right now to make the playstyle possible. Just go full terminator mode and aim to activate overclock over every possible loop and escape route. Hell, you can even invalidate one-way zones with pre-planned pods, but watch out incase they disable them before beginning a chase.

Gabriel is nice, but I expect a rework of their Made For This perk coming soon, since it stacks with Hope and allows you to outspeed slower killers in the late-game.

Personally, I've found great success playing the Singularity as a glorified M1 killer, but I can agree their ability is a bit deceptive and makes them out to be an area of denial/trap killer. I hope this helps people consider and avoid paying/spending shards on a killer that doesn't match their preferred playstyle!",0,1

"I would recomend this game only if you want something cheap and a singleplayer dinosaur ""simulator"" experience (stopping to think now, I think many of these recent dinosaur simulator games are multiplayer, having something that is singlerplayer, like this one, I think is good). This game sure has some improvements if compared to the frist one, but it also have the same problems of the frist game:

- The game doesn't have a tutorial, which can be a problem to new players;

- I think the game could have some type of minimap,  because I got lost many times while trying to find the pods (Just to not get lost, I always walk across the edge of the map);

- The Scan seems to do nothing, it doesn't show me food or water, making me to find these myself;

- The new way to unlock the dinosaurus I think is cool (in the older one, you would need to find the Mutant version of the dinosaur, then kill it, and then you would unlock it. Thanks to that method, I've never unlocked the Therizinosaurus, because the map feels all the same). In this sequel, now to unlock new dinosaurus, you need to destroy a certain amount of pods. I like this, but then again, since the map feel the same, I think is somewhat hard to find these pods;

- The dinosaurus in this game will chase you for the rest of their lifes. You can only escape them by fighting them or using a really fast dinosaur, like the desert version of Appalachiosaurus (one of the stater dinosaurus, and the desert version already come along with it), if you spam the jump (which is the Left Alt by default) with it, you can basically escape from everything. This guy is also a good way to travel in the maps;

- This game explain its lore, but for some reason, you can find the lore of this game only in the description of the game in the Steam page, because in the game itself, never explains the lore, the pods and the mutants just exists.

For the pros, it does have some new dinosaurus, like Megalosaurus, Allosaurus, Kentrosaurus and, the one I liked the most (just because it is brazilian) Oxalaia. 
The game now have Alpha and Apex versions for some dinosaurus, which have a significant better stats than the normals ones (or worse, as the moment I'm writing this, I just got the Alpha Plateosaurus, and it is almost a better Plateosaurus, but it is slower than the normal one). 
The way the camera is positioned reminds me of Disney's Dinosaur PC/PS2 game, which I like it.

I have no idea if the developer of this game will keep woking on it, since he/she is woking in a other dinosaur game (Dinosaurs Dominion), but I think is game is good just to have a little fun.

Edit: I just finished the game, and after I've destroy all the pods, I have unlocked the final map, which is a boss battle against a big mutant Tiktaalik (an animal that is the transition from fish to amphibian) and a giant pod, the Mother Pod, which is just a larger pod with more health. And after I had beaten the Tiktaalik and destroyed the Mother Pod, I just won the game, I didn't even get any reward, which I think is a shame, because I have spend 7,2 hours playing this game (I've spend that many hours just trying to find the pods, even with the help of the desert Carnotaurus, which I think it is the fastest dinosaur in the game).",0,1

Back before Randy Orton made ""420"" cool, no one was getting higher than MR MONDAY NIGHT.    This is the pack I was looking forward to the most and would have paid the full 14.99 for RVD alone.  

Unfortunately, they have tainted this pack, like Vince McMahon tainted John Cena's 20 year celebration, by adding a lower life form defined as human, who made his fame by filming corpses in a forest in japan.

I look at the yay reviews for this Lame Person.  I think it's not only a poor reflection on him, but on you.   Your endorsing his celebration of another humans lowest point in life, where they see no other way out.   Shame on you.   This is exactly, what is wrong with the world today.

""Yeah, but he wrestled wrestlemania you argue"" .   So what!   One tag match with the Miz and he gets a victory over Mysterio.   This idiot gets to be digitally immortalized in arguably the best version of WWE video gaming in 12 years?  

No!   I even wrote to WWE 2k22 support.   I said I was happy just to pay for RVD alone if you could remove suicide film boy.   

Support said they couldn't.  I said you removed Carter because of false allegations  (turns out it was a german dictators salute)  but you will not remove this creature?    No response.

I get it WWE.   You values are not THEN.  NOW.  TOGETHER.   It is clearly, MONEY.   REPUTATION.   INFLUENCE.  

You can still release Lame Person in another DLC, just not with RVD.   You should have changed him out with Jerry Lynn.   

ECW Living Dangerously 5 star match right there.   So what if Jerry is with AEW.   Mickie James and RVD are with IMPACT.

I really hope AEW Fight Forever plays as good, if not better.    Then I can bury this title, faster than Triple H tried to bury RVD.   

LP belongs in a ""Waste of Space"" DLC pack.   You could include WWE Hall of Famer Donald Trump, Jimmy Snuka, Pat Patterson, and Chris Benoit.   Perfectly matched.  

Looks like Vince is pretty guilty WWE2K22, are you going to remove him at some stage?

"Not as ""weird"" all in all but a pretty solid game. Language localization could use some work, there are some things, like art assets, that have not been modified in the slightest. Difficulty scaling is a bit odd.. if you dodge at all the correct times you could theoretically beat every boss from the very beginning of the game (though it would take a long time). But, with an average dodge ratio, let's say two dodges for every one hit that you take, the amount of damage that you take makes it seem like there should be at least one or two more bosses in-between every boss that you face. Either that or you are expected to farm the bosses in order to get every piece of their armor before going on to the next area.

Due to it being made with Unity, the game will occasionally lag when there are too many visual effects on the screen at the same time.

There is very limited direction/information on where to go and what to do and due to the game's name it is very difficult to search for if you get stuck. The summon defeated bosses aspect of the game is never really explained (that I remember) and one must figure it out on their own. Overall, I wouldn't spend more than $2-$5 for it as it currently is.

　I didn't expect a tower defense gameplay, but the concept seemed cool—destroying American-like military vehicles using sci-fi weapons in 2077 Afghanistan. Managing wattage and temperature for our laser gun on the street was interesting. But I wasn't a fan of the decision to make it an ""arcade"" game. I prefer linear tower defense games. This game feels chaotic with multiple paths on some maps. We can't just randomly spam buildings so we rely on side bombs to destroy enemy vehicles since our ""gun"" isn't dependable. The electric concept is unique, though. I've never seen or played anything like it. I don't mind the arcade style with leaderboards, giving purpose to our efforts, but it might need some updates since it's still in early access.

　I think the graphics were decent. I liked how the light created motion blur while scrolling, making the electric pole's light noticeable for game mechanics. The issue is that some vehicles are not memorable. It would be better if they added color indicators for which vehicle can be countered by which gun. Overall, the rest was fine, but—

The UI was terrible! it's so ugly. They should consider making changes to it. Why use one screen for everything? Achievements, leaderboards, etc. could have separate menu sections. It would be much more user-friendly to have a menu, level selection, ability picking, and so on. In the game, everything was fine, but the UI needs improvement. I think they lack an ""artist"" and probably just paid someone for the UI, but it's not good at its current state, except for the graphics

　As I said, since I mentioned the arcade aspect, it will have that kind of gameplay that makes you need to play it multiple times. There aren't a lot of maps available. some of them are beautiful, while others are hard to read, and the level design is bad. As for the multiplayer aspect, oh yeah, you have a leaderboard to show off.

　The game's current state has so many bugs, and I disagree with the hitboxes. Also, I don't understand why they made the ""cable"" have a collision. Whenever I try to place a building, it becomes unavailable because the game thinks I want to put it above the cable. I hope the developers notice this issue soon. btw using keyboard and mouse with no problem.

　Here's the thing, I would love it if they made some cutscenes that are easy to understand. Believe me, until now, I don't even know why we need to shoot those military vehicles and stuff. Making a simple storyline like 'we set a trap to destroy the foreign invaders in our country' would make more sense than what we have now. Having small cutscenes with simple illustrations would help. As for the story, unfortunately, this game has nothing to offer.

　There's an auditory issue in the game. While there's an indicator through sound, there's no visible indicator, which is frustrating. Why don't they have a feature that tells us if there's a vehicle near the trap bomb? I keep losing track of the enemy since I don't know where they are. Maybe a minimap would help. Other than that, the sound settings are impressive, but I need more. It's not good for people with disabilities.

Here's a little suggestion for the developers because I've read some existing reviews on the store page. As an indie game developer, this is probably why AAA developers remain completely silent and never reply to reviewers on the Steam page :

https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/reviews
""Don't respond to every review. There will be times that something is worth clarifying with a response, but be very thoughtful about how your communication will be received.""

　Like I said, a few small steps could make this game better. Currently, the leaderboard gives people some purpose, but it may need more improvement in the future. Also, the developers should consider creating a Discord community or building a small community to get better feedback, as good games are always built on feedback.

　For that price and simple tower defense gameplay, it's kinda worth it. I did notice weird GPU usage that keeps utilizing my GPU even when trying on the lowest settings possible, but it seems the developers are already aware of it.

"Pros:
- It's Level Up system.

I find Level Up module a more interesting than simple DnD 5e due to classes having more possibilities/abilities ([strike]instead of simple bonk fighter, *cough-cough*[/strike]). So if I had to choose between a simple DnD 5e and Level Up I'd choose of course the Level Up.

Cons:
- It's not actually the Level Up!
- No Expertise/Speciality System (Really?)
- No Character Wizard (Seriously?)
- No Section for Combat Manuevers (Oh come on!)

I mean, who makes a module, without its core mechanic - expertise system? No expertise dices, no indication of skill speciality existing (even in video explaining this module, poor dude had to actually create himself a speciality for his skill, and still it was just a plain copy of the skill itself with no differences). You just want me to remember that I've actually a speciality, and then roll a d20, then only roll additional dice instead of combining then in one roll, don't you?

And Level Up is more loaded with Character creation (due to having many things like Destiny, Maneuvers, Speciality, etc). A cool system of creating a character with step-by-step would be actually useful, but no... you just expect the player to read the book like 5 times to remember that they actually need also to choose 2 starting speciality?

And Combat Maneuvers... Look how they massacred my boy... Combat Maneuvers were put into the Feat section. With no filtering by tradition or level. Wasted. (Spells by the way has too plain interface of selection. But I guess it Fantasy Grounds itself by fault.)

So, yeah. By it's current state I'd say I just wasted my money on this module for nothing. I hope it will be improved for better in future. Even VTT has better functionality/modules for Level Up, although it has flaws too.",1,0
Rally poor effort. Shame on Steam and the producers for allowing it to go out in this state. The worst Early Access game i've ever purchased,0,1
"Note: Every episode is about 2h long even though episode 3 is much more pricey, I'll review each of them separately since they're basically different games.

Episode 1: This feels more like a beta than a game, its very hard to know what is or isn't something you can grind, the controls feel pretty decent though the camera is a little low making it hard to see in front of your characters which makes some precise jumps difficult to predict. This game has 3 characters, the first one is ""balanced"" but id argue its the worst one, one is a bit faster which is good for races and the 3rd one has better air letting her jump higher for extended distances, she also makes every challenge piss easy. The game has cops too, they kinda just cling on you like in the original JSR, but you can't really fight them, there are cameras that make very opaque circles that kinda blind you and shoot you, there are also no rivals you can race or fight. The game does feature a small boss at the end that you can defeat in 5 seconds. Visually the game looks a bit ugly, but its somewhat charming in a similar way as Psychonauts 1. The animations though are really janky and unappealing to me. The music is also just using as many samples that Hideki Naganuma has used before to a point where its mostly just distracting.
Overall Episode 1 is about a 6/10

Episode 2: This one improves on the first game while keeping most of the gameplay the same with a few tweaks. The city is slightly bigger and has way better level design with less confusion over what you can or cannot grind. The camera's red circles aren't as opaque as before and are placed in areas where they can actually mess with the player. If you're still using the op girl from the first game this time she can build unreal amount of speed by chaining air combos which might've been in the first game, but I didn't learn how to do them until episode 2. The game does feature 2 new characters though with stats that are kinda useless? The game also has events against npcs now which are pretty fun and add more variety than just ""Get all the pink checkpoints"". The music is mostly the same deal as the first game except they also sampled memes now.
Overall Episode 2 is about a 6.7/10

Episode 3: The first thing you'll notice is that thing game has a different cell shading artstyle. It was incredibly jarring at first, but I got used to it fairly quickly, I think the shadows are just a little too dark for my taste. The city was much more interesting level design wise again, but it also had more pedestrians that had about exactly 2 lines of dialogue, some areas seemed a bit unoptimised though because I could notice some slight frame drops even though I'm running on a 3060ti and an i7. Yet this game looks worse than a dreamcast game that released when I was 1 year old. The momentum also seemed quite nerfed, air combos don't build much speed and now running is faster, but much more boring, speaking of boring, most of the objectives in episode 3 are just ""Spray 6 graffiti on this wall"". I didn't talk about spraying before because it was mostly optional, but its quite slow, you have no incentive to make the full versions of any of them and its kinda boring as an objective since they aren't a strategic objective like in JSR, but they're also not a fun platforming challenge that gives you quick dopamine like in JSRF. There's also the infamous 13 platform challenge from Future for some reason, it just feels like the developers don't have any original ideas. The soundtrack is also very much copied from Future, though instead of just spamming as many Naganuma samples they just remade ""Rock it on"" and ""Concept of love"" except instead of saying ""Understand"" the song says ""We be cumming""??????????|
Oh yeah there's 2 new characters, there's Red shirt Shaggy and a trans girl, I didn't use them.
Overall this is the most polished episode, but the most boring one as well, its a 6.4/10",0,1

You can view my gameplay & early impressions here: https://youtu.be/TnuEUlXhoFY

It's not bad for being free and for being in Early Access. The big problem is that there just isn't a lot of content. You have one game mode and one map. Plus you definitely want to play against other live players because going against the bots is boring (as you can see from my YT video).

Still, it's alright if you're in the target audience. If you're looking for a free, kid-friendly PvP game that is easy on those new to VR, then you may have more fun playing it than I did. I just don't think this is meant for VR veterans who have tons of hours playing all kinds of VR games. After all, why would you play this instead of Breachers, Pavlov, or Contractors if you're looking for a pvp VR fix?

The only thing going for it is that it is free and kid-friendly. It needs more game modes and content. You do have full locomotion, smooth & snap turning available. You can temporarily jet pack in the air. There are comfort options as well. Performance was fine on my RTX 3080.

"Forums are dead, common idle functions are missing like Max purchase for potions and gem upgrades. 

-Game is repetitive and boring.  
-Content is lacking for the price tag.
-You watch chests appear and go away, you get money and gems.  You spend that money to get items and upgrade your damage.  
-You prestige and do it all over again.  There isn't much to it at all, it has the amount of content almost all free to play idle games if not far less.  
-I tried to play it until I maxed out all achievements.  Half of the time i had even forgotten that I had it running in the background. 
-It is okay, I feel there isn't enough content to warrant a full price purchase.",0,1
I cant add two of the F3 engines I just purchased to any sceanerio. When I try to add M&SL and MKT. to a free form sceanerio nothing shows up and the game freezes. I have to restart my computer again. I contacted support and received a large info sheet that lists 10 points to read and see if that works. It got so complicated that I couldnt figure it out. Can someone tell me how to re download this DLC again.,0,1
"literally cannot progress after the starting scene. the first story fight, the two characters in the city are so much stronger. there's no way to grind out levels or anything either. wtf??? did anyone even tested this game out or what. game breaking. unable to progress due to how absurd the starting fights in the city is.

EDIT: ok after restarting and understanding there is a sacrifice card and draw system, game is doable but hard. also had to get the armor from a rando side quest random option to carry me. balance is just wack.",0,1
"The mission is fun but is very short, being just a few arena fights followed by a boss. The skin is the best looking skin in the game which is nice, but ultimately it is just a recolor.

"Take this with a pinch of salt. But FM23 is as close to a step down as any previous edition was.

The decline in headline features, and impact they have on the game, is staggering this edition, and have been declining for over a decade if everyone wore to be honest about it.

Right, with that doomsday opening, let me explain what I mean - Sports Interactive delivers a game each year that is already quite good, so to improve on it or changing anything, is both a risk and unnecessary from the viewpoint of a developer, as FM constantly outsell previous editions.

FM22 sold more than FM21, and 21 more than 20, and 20 more than 19. Everything shouts - Do no changes, steady on.

Furthermore, FM has no real competition, unless we talk of mobile managers and FIFA’s scuffed career mode, which is hardly worth a mention to begin with. FM also got an audience and core playbase that are old, at least old to what is to be considered normal for most games, which means, people with limited time to play the game duo to (responsibilities,) but also not limited by the youths' small pockets. The core player base happily pays 40 to 60£ each year, it is after all just a grab in the pocket, compared to many other things in life, for those middle aged audience. 
What they buy, means less, then what the feeling of playing the newest edition gives them in quality. I include myself in that ridiculous sentiment, as like clockwork, I am one of those old sentimental fools.
What I'm trying to say, I or other, and possibly you, are the minority, loud and proud playing thousand of hours. But the majority, will be happy with what they buy, since the game is already great, so they rarely speak up.

[h1]Graphics and Match engine:[/h1]

If I was asked, what is the best thing about FM23 compared to FM22, I would say, the small animation changes and slight fluidity improvements the match engine seems to have. Though I have said that for 5 years in a row now. 

But the graphics that showcase the mechanical changes, still look like something from 2002, arguably even worse graphics now than 10 years ago, and if you start comparing graphics to other new management games, we really start to wonder why FM is not allowed a new engine. That said, it was still the best upgrade in FM23. 

The entitlement is strong, I demand a new engine, not now, not next year, but for the love of God give me a new Engine and something that actually feels like a new game when it comes to graphics, even if it comes with an extra cost, and waiting years for it in development … just let me know, that something is coming, something we can look forward to in maybe 3 or 4 years while it is getting developed. Trust me on this, I will still buy the next 3-4 games anyhow, but give me what I want, and the information that it is coming. 

[h1]“headline” features in FM23:[/h1]

[b]Dynamic manager timeline[/b] - Is not a headline feature, but SI call it that. It is more or less, information that already was represented in the game on another page, and making it look a bit more fancy and pretty. 
I do not know how long it took to make, but it looks like something I personally could make in a couple of days, including all the background coding for links and pictures locations, and what have you now. My point, calling this a headline feature, is absolutely idiotic from any standpoint of trying to sell a new game. 

[b]AI manager improvements[/b] - Still too early to really make a call on the AI manager improvements they have made. If it works how I think or hope it will, is this easily the biggest improvement this edition, but I have seen these types of hidden mechanics being oversold by SI before. 
Please SI, I hope this is where the effort was made. Anything that has to do with AI behaviors in many aspects, is exactly what makes a good game in my opinion. 

[b]Squad planner[/b] - A fancy notepad, the problem is, that it is half baked. It has potential, don’t get me wrong, but it feels strict to use. To me, they are forcing it down my throat, with hard-coded views. No statistics views (what the F?), and even more stupid, why would they make us plan for the future, but forget to put in looking at the past, to actually see how the players developed over time?
I’ll likely use it, since it is better than notepad (barley), but also 100% feels a half baked desgin. 
Hopefully it will be more customizable in FM24.

[b]Recruitment nonsense[/b] - I do not know how many times the recruitment center, and how they give us information on players have changed over the years. One thing I do know, is that the mechanics behind the recruitment, and how the AI handles it, is exactly the same. 
This is the definition of a repack. It is shown in a new way, wrapped all up, and looks arguable better, and is more coherent. I’ll give them that, but again, is that a headline feature?

[b]Agent improvement[/b] - It makes sense to talk to agents before anyone else when negotiating contracts. My worry is that there will be a cookie cutter text to click, like almost all other AI interactions in the game, that will make it feel almost pointless. Hopefully, they are starting to make it more dynamic, but I doubt it.

[b]Supporter confidence[/b] - Yes, the Board V2.0. Is it dynamic? If not, who cares about it then? 
If it doesn't change over time with how the club develops, then why even implement it?
Again, the AI both in terms of the board and now the supports interact with with the rest of the game, seems to be nonexistent. You can lose 10 times in a row, and the supporters still hope that your gegenpressing tactic will work for today's game. What a load of absolute **** AI coding. 

This could have been awesome, hopefully will be in a couple of editions, but the lazy designs, and going down the same route as how the Board is working, is leaving me with the feeling, that this is it. This is what we can expect.

[b]UEFA License[/b] - Okay. Just okay. Headline? Probably not, but alright, it is what it is.

[b]Final thoughts[/b] - Is it okay to pay 60£ each year, when the changes, or lack of, is neither quality or quantity compared to other games? 
The answer is of course, yes. If you chose to do it, you chose to do it. But that does not mean, that you can't want more from the FM series. I could even say, entitled to want more.

I'm disappointed, but not angry, that this is where FM is, in 2023 edition. I expected it, but hoped for more. In many ways, the game is giving me the same now, as it did back in 2003. That is both positive and a negative, as I could easy imagine how good it could be 20 years down the line, but also I could not have foreseen how many incredible hours the game would give me, since the core game is great. 

Opening FM03, the core mechanics haven't changed, it is the same game in many aspects. There are improvements, but not worth 20 years of improvements. I'm disappointed, not be course it cost me 60£ 20 times since then, but be course I'm left with the feeling, it might be one of the last editions that FM can give me those positive amount of enjoyable hours, if this is the path SI is continuing down.

EDIT: 28/6-2023 (I'm changing my review to a thumbs up, after the blog update from Miles as of this day (The Future of Football Manager.) FM23 is a good game, but my points is still valid, as it is a disappointing set of new features compared to its previous peers, which Miles also acknowledge in the blog. Furthermore, and most important is the clarity of receiving news of a new Unity engine in FM25, which I would I have liked to see earlier announced, but better late then never, both in terms of the news, and the Engine itself. 

Credit where credit's due. I hope for even more transparency in the future.",0,1

[h1]Good things:[/h1] 

This game is a mix of 4 mini games. There is hidden objects game and there is match 3 game and there is a game where you have to pick the right ingredients to create cupcakes according to orders and one game where you have to put toppings on the pizza in the right spots.

You can upgrade your recipes in your recipe book to make your dishes give you more money and you can also upgrade your restaurant for it to look better. You can also buy hints and boosters for hog mini game. All in all hidden objects game is the biggest part of this game.

[h1]Bad things:[/h1] 

To tell the truth I really only liked the cupcakes mini game as it was the one that was the most close to real cooking. The second good mini game was the pizza one but it had many strange ingredients as topping like potato chips or things covered in chocolate but all in all it was an ok game as you try to match your pizza look to the one that was ordered. The match 3 game was really basic and it was not interesting at all and the game even gives you free hints what to move where if you don’t click anything for 3 seconds.

The main part of the game is hidden objects game and by far it is the worst part of this game. The products are lying all over kitchen/restaurant even on ground or are floating in the air so they are all over the place just randomly put everywhere and the whole kitchen/restaurant looks like a chaos and health and safety hazard. Also the whole cooking is just clicking the products in order that are displayed under the customer one by one and that makes the recipe book pointless as you can’t just remember what ingredients are needed for a dish and just click them when you see them – no you have to click the one ingredient that is displayed under the customer and only after that you can click another one and another one. It would be much better if they would just get rid of the whole hidden objects game and instead let you pick ingredients and mix them up in order to cook a meal just like you do in the cupcake mini game.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1] 

This is just a mix of 4 mini games and I found only 1 of them to be fun. If you are looking for fun cooking game look somewhere else.

Love Love Joe Biden is, perhaps, one such work. In roughly half an hour the creator of this masterpiece manages
to exceed human limitations and create a gripping, hair sniffing narrative that will change society for the better.

The next generation will not be divided by world events, but instead whether they were born before or after the release of Love Love Joe Biden. Though human beings are ephemeral this work will become the titan's shoulders that the next generation of creatives stand upon.

"The new songs and bow are cool. NOT HAVING THE DASH FOR THE ROUGELIKE ISNT. It's like having run turned off in a ""boomer shooter"". It's like having both of your legs broken so the sword becomes 1/2 as useful. Would be fine if it wasn't an unlock that needs you to get it randomly enough times to get it back. Double jumps can only avoid so much. So it feels extra bad to lose because I COULD DODGE THE FUCKING EXPLOSIONS! It's still fun but the need to fail and get lucky enough times to get a basic thing back sucks. 

IF you get this it's for the songs. 
EDIT: So the longer I play the rougelike the more I hate it. It's a MASSIVE time sink like the worst of the rogelikes. With walls that you have near 0% chance to break without getting lucky. The blade ends up doing the heavy lifting because the weapons, even if you dont use them, last 4 rounds. So it's a game of, will this fucking trash mode give me the damage upgrades I need? NO a lot of the time but that's okay you can play the same 4 areans that are just a little too small another 100 times. There's nothing to unlock that wasn't just taken from you from the base game and put behind a 1/2 assed ""upgrade"" system. And since you need echos after you eventually get your execute and dash back. It's rush to a lvl 5 upgrade for a gun so it'll get you echos faster. The bow needs to reload and I don't me ready an arrow but reload the quiver. It's fucking stupid and makes the crowsbow and the other dlc weapon better. Since it needs on beat heatshots and to reload while taking up a slot for something useful. You can't ban or weed out shit you don't want from appearing like in Vampire survivors. So the enemies get stonger you can have no weapon with a damage upgrade on it. Unless you upgraded the sword which the game and this mode aren't really balanced around. Since PAZ dosn't fit into any of the categories for weapon damage upgrades. BUT IT""S OKAY because there are upgrades that make the enemies explode and hurt you. Maybe there is a permanent damage upgrade after you hit the 3rd pillar? Fuck if I know right now as the lack of lucky has be walled around wave 18.

"I do not like this DLC Pack, but then again I also did not like the later seasons of Camp Cretaceous as much.

You only truly get 2 new species in this pack, the rest are re-skins or remodels of already existing animals. Though thankfully the remodels are only for animals in the base game so you can utilize them immediately.

That said, I do not prefer the Remodels over their base game counterparts, and the skins are Bumpy (hah) at best and bland at worst, with the notable outliers of the Bioluminescent Parasaurolophus. That however has nothing to do with the quality of the skin, and more so the mediocrity of the source material.

That said, I have thoughts on the 2 new animals 

The Scorpius Rex is interesting. Its hideous, but its a prototype of the Indominus so its to be expected. It does the iconic bipedal roar thing, it has its venom, and it sounds good. Shame its a hybrid though as I personally dislike the Hybrids as a whole.

The Monolophosaurus is...forgettable. Its texturing is odd, the skins it has are vibrant but I personally would use other medium theropods before it. It honestly just kind of feels like a strange in between of the Hererasaurus and the Metriacatnthosaurus to me.

While at launch I would have recommended against this pack, with the advent of the Re-Models now being able to be customized like the old models, I feel its alright and the variety it adds is well worth the price. I would wait for a sale but if you enjoyed CC more than I did then pick it up.",0,1
"The new skulls added with this DLC are great. Even the least good among them is still good, just not my style.

After the many hours of fun I got out of this game, all the free content updates, and the superb finale to the story introduced at the same time as this DLC I feel scummy with paying just the modest price asked for this skull-pack.

"I am not sure i can currently recommend this game.  It has potential, but currently is really unfinished.  It is early access so giving it the benefit of the doubt. It is not very balanced.  I unlocked most of the in game upgrades, and you get to the same later game boss and insta die.  Most of the classes play the same.  Monk is the only one that has a unique skill (almost unique anyway, only seen it drop once on another class) and its probably the best skill. 
 The issue is the game is pretty boring, get aoe skill on low cooldown.  Sit in one place till boss arrives, kill boss open chest, repeat till next boss.  Some of the skills don't do much, strength and agility seems pretty useless.  Agility speeds you up a little but not enough to outrun later stage bosses that just one shot you. 
Projectile skills are pretty pointless.  They don't fire often enough so are unreliable.  Unless you have a PBAoE, you just die.",0,1

"I played this game on stream and to be fair game don't provide you any information, first thing that I want to tell at bad things regarding this game: price was around 10 euro now is 2.4 euro without any discount, gameplay is very simple you don't have much to do, levels looks kinda same, is a very short game around 1-2 hours to say depend if you understand fast what you need to do.

Pro it have many hidden features and you can make anything in him if you understand the mecanics.

To be fair you need to set the town on fire and do some small objectives but don't impact anything major for levels.",1,0

"<h2>The Good</h2>
- Very charming and unique art direction
- Fun
- Addictive

<h2>The Bad</h2>
- Rework necessary for the boss

<h2>The Details</h2>
This is a very fun game. The game board allows for you to really get creative with how you play.
That being said...
This game needs some balancing. Either the game is far too RNG heavy or the boss needs to be reworked. It's an astronomical jump in difficulty from regular play to the boss. I get it, bosses are supposed to be tough. However, when your ""strength"" is purely based on a die and luck, then it changes everything.",1,0

"I wont say it deserves a negative review, but it's certainly not worth $59.99. it has very fun combat, story is great.. but there is very little immersion.. it's not a true adventure game. It's more along the lines of an anime story and the critical fight scenes it lets you partake in them. What does annoy me is when you're dusting the enemy and the cutscene shows you getting dumpstered although you just booty stomped that boss. the game is fun and the story is good but there are too many slides and cs to make this really enjoyable.. wait for a sale, unless you like these style games. i can promise you i won't buy another $59 anime again. lolol",0,1

"The experience wasn't as smooth as I had hoped, but I imagine it takes a lot of resources to make the world look like a painting. The devs really made an effort to imitate the painter's style. 

The game can be finished in less than an hour and it's a one-time experience. There's no reason to go back despite the option to chose a chapter from the main menu. 

Stealth is the main mechanic. You need to walk the linear path throught the city while hiding from the Inquisition. Everything is very forgiving and you won't be seen through walls or across the street. 

The game is neither a walking sim nor an adventure. It only has a single simple puzzle and a couple of locked doors that need a key.",0,1

"Very faithful remake to the SNES/DS classic. In good and bad ways.

The graphical upgrade is great and a good preview of what to expect for the next one. The story and core mechanics were left untouched, though, and that's where it starts being a mixed bag.

The story was good, so no need to change it, though adding few cutscenes for the most important would have been welcome. But that's ntipicking here.

What was annoying though, was the lack rebalancing of weapon and robot parts. Some of them unlock at weird times, being obsolete the moment you can access them, and some other -more costly- should have better specs than cheaper ones, yet they don't.
Which wouldn't be much of a problem if QOL were made to the UI.

The gear setup phases being one an important aspect of the game, it being cluttered in various menus (one for shop, one for available stock) and no easy way to compare specs without a lot of back and forth, makes it very time consuming. Especially as the battles usually allow to have 10 or 11 mechs, which you have to upgrade 1 by 1 in the menus, with very their cumbersome yet incomplete layout.

Oh and the ingame information is very lacking too. How skills work and how they unlock is a mystery unless you use a guide (one for the SNES/DS versions will suffice), and most of the weapons seem useless when they get unlocked, because the subtle differences between them and the best of their tier is undocumented.

I'm ranting here of course. I still enjoyed the game! But you should know that what was unpractical and unpolished in the original, well.. it still is here, just with modern graphics.

Buy it if you want to redo FM1 with modern graphics before FM2 comes out, or if you're fine discovering an old classic despiate its dated mechanics and UX. Despite all the negative I said, I enjoyed it for what is was (faithful to a fault) and I'm eager to get FM2, as its original had a better gameplay that I never had a chance to try myself (never released in EU)

"I have only played one round so far, but i want to get out first impression and a WARNING ! foremost.

If you have played ""20 Minutes Till Dawn"" (20MTD) you will kinda know this game.
It feels like a Copy-Cat.

Many, if not most, (!) upgrades are the same as in 20MTD, often straight up 1:1 copy.
You get small bosses and normal bosses. Those get you upgrade crates. Those from real bosses will net you good upgrades which often do reduce your max health (same as in 20MTD)
2. char will have more starting HP (same as in 20MTD)
Bosses will create an arena, those outer lines will also look very similar to the ones found in 20MTD.
Even the reload animation is the same.

Translation (in my testing case english) is just a ""google translation"". I guess most other than the native language will be.

Is it just a reskin of 20MTD ? 
No.
It does bring some new things to the table you'll find in other survivors games.
Like Magnet which attracts all loot/exp. Some Power-Ups in the field.
Gold Ressource for permanent upgrades/new characters. 
Has more colorful graphics than 20MTD.

So if you haven't played 20MTD it might be worth buying. 
Otherwise i'd wait.

Wouldn't have thought that i'd buy like a 80-90% rip-off from 20MTD.

Don't trust Overwhelmingly Positive Steam Reviews this is a game of Digital Homicide Quality,1,0
"There are many words in the english language. ""Purport"" is one of them. Also for instance the word ""digest"" is another example of this point. Now that I have proven a mastery of words I will attempt to use a couple words in this review to explain my thoughts on this video game which is of course something you yourself are allowed to purchase on Steam if that is something that you wish to do but if not I might understand however I really would suggest that you wait until the end of this review in order to make such a large decision one way or the other. I will continue. What we have here is an example of a video game which I mentioned previously. In this specific game you take on the role of a man who is faced with an unimaginably steep series of consequences for his behavior occurring before the game has a chance to begin. The details are left vague, an artistic choice to allow the player to fill in those gaps. It is true what they say the human mind is the most horrifying instrument of them all, after all, haha. Myself? I liked to imagine that this man lived a simple life void of excess and otherwise demonstrable behaviors such as that. Perhaps he was a bus driver or maybe a janitor of a hospital! Living a meager live but wanting for very little. That was, of course, until the day he came face to face with his destiny as we all do at some point in our lives. This day I mentioned earlier is of course the day that he found what shall be henceforth known as The Doll. Unbeknownst to him at this current juncture the trajectory of his live was about to shift dramatically, and this is where we find our intrepid hero when our story begins.

Exciting enough for you ;)?

Yeah... thought so.

Anyway, what does this game have to offer? I think a better question might be what DOESN'T it have to offer and I feel you will feel as I have felt when I myself was asked what my feelings were towards this specific question in regards to how it made me feel specifically. This feeling of course doesn't need explanation, however I will explain anyway (as I mentioned before I have a very well rounded understanding of english words and I understand some of you may not therefore some of this might need to be spelled out for some of you especially if some of the people reading some of these words are a part of a younger audience which if you're a parent and reading this just know this game might not be appropriate for some of those younger people out there however that's obviously up to your discretion as a parent and I myself personally would never deign to step in between that sort of relationship) as I was saying... The feelings that this game elicits are ones that can be described only as dread and fear and terror and hardship and also the word spooky is another one that comes to mind but again to me personally you might not feel exactly the same way I do but I hope I've cast a wide enough net to help some of you out there understand exactly what it is that you will be getting yourselves into by playing this video game which as we established earlier is in fact a video game. 

So now you're asking yourself or perhaps thinking aloud ""well okay this game is scary, it's raw, it's rugged, and it's for sure those things. But is it more?"". And that my friend is a good question to be asking and I always appreciate a good question as many people who know me irl would attest to. The answer to this question? Yes. There is more. There is so much more. Under the surface of this hidden gem of a horror game exists a concept that is truly scary, and that, my friends, is where the real genius lies. The concept of uncertainty. Never knowing when the next blow will occur or perhaps not being aware of your surroundings entirely or maybe even for you in this specific instance you might say you don't know what's going to happen next within the larger sequence of events and that is a thing that you start to feel might make you uncertain about where the future is going to lie at the end of the whole experience that you are currently having while playing this videogame which as we established above is certainly a videogame and now I think I have established that twice. 

It is for this reason and also many others that I have hopefully at this point have done a good job of establishing above that I would say under no circumstances should you play this game if you find yourself being the type of person who is sensitive to feelings of overwhelming horror and dread and discomfort and terror and fear and many many many other things of that particular nature that are all things that are all present in this game and you WILL see some of these things pop up as you play it. 

Proceed with caution my friends for once you find the answers to the questions that you seek you may find yourself regretting being the kind of person to have ever even asked those questions in the first place.

"Gosh damn is this a great looking and enjolyable game! (Is what I would like to say)

The aesthetic design and progression are very enjoyable. Levelingup gear and finding new loots is the best!

I have had this on my Wishlist for Months and I was very excited to finally get to play it...

But, there are some issues... The complete lack of controller Support is sort of lame. 
The Hitboxes are very difficult to nail down. I have turned my mouse speed up to the maximum and still struggle to get my cursor in position in time.
The Delay on the right mouse button to use the shield is very frustrating, there is a delay on the deployment of the shield which makes it very easy to miss.
There are no Trajectory lines when reflecting objects and so that can cause them to fly in all sorts of directions.
Trying to attack a target while having to simultaneously pull back for a block and factor in delay for shield deployment or to deflect a projectile away or towards the sender feels incredibily stressful and is very difficult.

Overall, it is a neat game and it sure is a looker. I just wish the controls felt better. If you have any type of motor impairment disability in your arms/eyes/hands however than this game is literally just not for you.",1,0

"Dragon Dawn I'm okay with. It's $10 and I think it was that price already at its release.

For this, I just don't know.

Reaver culture is the main selling point, and I think it's pretty reasonable well done for what it is. 4 tomes is also 2 more tomes than came with Dragon Dawn.

Avian form in itself is meaningless to me... I guess it's cool for role-playing, but it's a cosmetic (though new traits are added as well, traits aren't directly linked to the forms in AoW4 anymore).

And some of the rest is kind of assorted odds and ends... bear mounts, 2 story maps.

This doesn't feel like a much bigger DLC than Dragon Dawn, in some ways. That might be because Dragon Dawn already sort of felt like it was a larger DLC... even though it didn't add a new culture, the Dragon hero/leader had its own sort of unique system to it. Maybe it's that Dragon Dawn was really good... maybe that's why this feels a bit weaker?

But I have to say, this is not something that for $20 feels like a much bigger DLC than Dragon Dawn.

"Ubisoft took the video in videogame a bit too serious. You will trip over videos. Start tutorial? Video. If you click a new ui bit? Video. Try to play solo? Video. Certain level progression? Video.
I got it at the steam launch sale of $10, it's alright for that price. Funnily enough even with all those videos, I feel I learned more from others how to play the game than the game teaches you....through videos. 

The good bits:
- I like how careful play makes it a lot easier, fits the spirit or rainbox six.
- After 3 games you figure out losing your operative can be a pain for a few games. But rotating operatives removes comfort zone bits.
- Trying to rescue your own operator i to save their progression is a good tricky frustration.

Less bits:
- Too many videos
- I feel the explanation how to deal with certain enemies could've been done better. The balance of information is all over the place. There's a bit of a learning curve I feel that might be at the root of why people might ditch it too soon.
- Loot is maybe too random. There's been times there was no ammo, other games where *everything* was ammo. I feel like it should at least consider your team's lineup to allow *some* options. I understand they might have went for the 'well sometimes you got to leave', but I think that happens too often to be a fun element in a online-service game that probably doesn't have great retention.

Judgement:
I'll get my fun out of it, but I can see why it's a mixed bag.",0,1
"Really wanted to like it. HLD one of my fav games of all time. It seems to lack so much of the depth and soul that I found in HLD. Style reminds me of Monument Valley. Remarkable at first, but ultimately without substance and grit. A game that non-gamers can get excited about. I think the game Gris was more successful with this floating dream style. Abilities are just handed out from the get go as if you're playing a sequel. Was content sliced here? Also the abilities are fairly easy to use ( You watch the character animate through final movements of sequences. Just sit back and watch... zzzzZZ )  which makes them feel unearned...

"Revenge of Noxi is a 2D side-scrolling action game in the vein of Ninja Gaiden or Shinobi but with a couple modern tricks up its sleeve. The game appears to be the second endeavor by developer Megamini009, following up a previous 2D game from a few years ago.

I'm all for a throwback to Shinobi, and I can very much feel what the developer was going for here. I really like the feeling of some of the protagonist's moveset: the jumpkick and slide moves in particular feel great, especially when you're executing a series of jumpkicks, bouncing back and forth between targets - it almost feels reminiscent of Hollow Knight's pogo bounce.

Enemies generally have fairly predictable movesets and attack patterns, and overall I did find them reasonably challenging to dispatch without being frustratingly difficult.

There are a number of areas I'd like to see improved, if the game receives ongoing updates:

1. It's a bit difficult to negotiate the fact that the player doesn't have total control of their moves/attacks at all times. Sometimes, it appears that a sword slash is executed, while at other times, shuriken are thrown. Sometimes, jumpkicks are executed, while at other times, shuriken are thrown. I think I see what the developer was going for - contextual attacks based on your target seems like an interesting idea. However, I really think it leads to a lack of player agency, and it generally just made me feel confused or frustrated. All I want is to jumpkick the flamethrower dudes! Let me jumpkick them!

2. The artwork across the game suffers from an issue I often see with small indie games: it was clearly created using a variety of different canvas sizes, resulting in individual pixels that are different sizes when comparing sprites and objects to one another. I would recommend aligning this. Use one sprite as your baseline - it will determine the pixel size for everything else.

3. There are a variety of collision issues across the game - they're particularly evident in the sewer level, both when sliding down slopes, as well as when swimming in general. These should be tightened up. Similarly, there are issues with hitboxes - the player's hitbox is frustratingly large, for example.

4. I don't know why so many indie games nowadays use mouse control when there's no need for it. I'd just default to keyboard controls for attacking. I know these can be remapped, but making your player work straight out of the gate isn't a great feeling.

5. There are some issues with the player character's state being reset or nulled, particularly when taking damage. For instance, if I'm sprinting and then get hit, not only do I stop sprinting, I also can't start sprinting again unless I release and press Shift again. This feels bad. Sprinting in particular should resume after damage is taken, even without the player needing to release and press the button again.

6. Level design gets a bit convoluted, particularly in the later levels. It's unclear to me if there are optional branching paths based on where the player exits the level. For instance, in the sewer level, there are a lot of vertical paths, but not a lot of guidance for the player as to why they might travel vertically. What's their motivation?

If the controls, level design, and artwork could be tightened up, I think this would be a really charming little action game. Parts of it feel nice and imbue a pleasant nostalgia to Shinobi and similar games. However, as it stands, I think the issues listed above make the game a bit frustrating to play, and the control issues in particular had me scratching my head more than a few times.

If you release an update addressing these issues, please leave a comment on this review and I'll be happy to take another look!

"Nice short game play, the sex is a little too robotic like, and not showing real penetration more like clipping. The texture in the promo does not match the texture in the game at max settings which should show the texture. Also for a game that is named orgasm simulator, it does not have an orgasm meter where there is a ""happy ending"" after each scene, just a loop of the same thing. Would be nice if there was an option to change positoin, do different actions like spanking, grabbing hair, etc during sex and raises the orgasm meter too.",1,0

"I agree with the reviewer that said this was not the best game in the series.
If you've played the others this will be disappointing in comparison.

I had no problem with wands without stars.
They reminded me of every wand I ever saw a stage magician use.
Did the wands of the fairy godmothers in Disney's OG animated Cinderella have stars?
I think not.
As to stars on wands, well maybe if it's for a 5 year old princess.

The unicorn artwork was ok, with puzzle 15 a standout with very nice equine looking beasts.
That was also the puzzle that the last unicorn I found was just it's butt, no leg just the butt, all else being hidden and needing a hint to find. 
Poor form.

Kid: Mom, can we have Beat Saber? 
Mom: You already have Beat Saber at home.
??? : Mutrix [Beat Saber at home]

So yeah this is a budget-priced Beat Saber clone. The devs here have unashamedly made their own Beat Saber clone which is probably as close to Beat Saber as you can legally get without probably being suited (as a lawyer, this statement is made solely for review / entertainment purposes, notice the several qualifying probablies, which means there is no certainty and is in no way intended as legal advice, however, if the devs at Mutrix want to pay me millions of dollars for my non-expert legal advice, they can consult me privately).

Is it as good as Beat Saber? No. Would anyone ever confuse this for the real Beat Saber? Probably not, unless they are very inebriated. The big differences are the UI, which is not as smooth and polished as the real Beat Saber and, obviously, the soundtrack, which is nowhere as good.

However, the gameplay is pretty similar. There may be a lawsuit in the future due to this. It almost looks the same. I wouldn't confuse one for the other, but maybe some VR noobs would (the preceding is not meant to be used as expert testimony in a court of law, it is solely for entertainment purposes). But you're probably wondering if you can play your custom songs from beatsaver unofficial website.  Yes, yes you can. I did and it's magnificent.

So for $4.99 USD is it worth it? I think so. Gameplay wise I really couldn't tell you the difference. I think maybe Beat Saber is a tad bit more responsive, but that might just be my imagination. For less than $5 bucks, you could do a lot worse in VR. With the custom song support, this is a no-brainer unless you already have Beat Saber that is. 

[b]Rate 7/10. Early Impressions Score. I don't mind spending $5 for a clone.[/b]

"Although this budget game is fine for a few rounds, you'll quickly forget about it because of the repetitive and grindy gameplay.

The story barely exists. All you need to know is that the cars have been infected by some sort of virus, and it's up to you to save the city. 

The city is divided into two parts and is quite small. The first part is the safe location where you may buy cars and cosmetic items. You cannot, however, choose what to purchase. The item is chosen at random from all the options. Because there are no upgrades or stats that would distinguish one car from another, it makes no difference which one you drive. There are more than 40 cars and more than a hundred items categorized under wheels, decals, and drift effects, so there’s a lot of choice.

And the other part of the city is where you destroy enemies. You won't have to waste time hunting for them because a mark over the car indicates their precise location. They won't intentionally try to kill you, but they will collect and use power-ups. After eliminating all enemies, you return to the safe zone and buy new items. Then you back into the fight.

Enemies can be destroyed either by crashing into them or by using one of several power-ups hidden in cubes all across the city. You have a pretty basic arsenal at your disposal. There’s a bomb that destroys everything around you and a bullet that can pass through walls. The good news is that you never run out of power-ups because they respawn virtually right after being used.

Crashing is not that fun. If you hit the car from the side or the rear, you lose some health but the enemy takes a lot of damage. However, if you collide head-on with the enemy, damage is dealt to both of you equally. Since the car gets damaged with each hit, you’ll have to watch out for pick-ups that patches you up to full health. 

You quickly come to the conclusion that crashing is simply time-consuming and boring. You only need the bullet, nothing else. All you have to do is get the enemy icon in the screen's center and fire. Even if the enemy is on the opposite side of the city, the bullet will still strike. 

In addition, the game doesn't introduce any fresh ideas. Every round is played in the same location with the same enemies. There is no change despite the game's attempts to add chapters and story bits provided by generic characters that mention more hostile and numerous adversaries. I didn’t spot any difference.

The game uses an excessive grind technique. If you want to get every car, you'll have to endure the only stage multiple times because the car costs 5k and you only get about 2k per round. 

Graphics are fine, but a lot of it is borrowed from pre-made assets. I’ve seen the same city and same textures in several games. Unfortunately, optimization is not ideal. Slowdowns occur even on the lowest setting, so the three preset choices are meaningless. On top of that, you can't turn off the unappealing white fog that is pouring from beneath your wheels. It is ugly and is most likely the root of poor optimization. And finally, the loading time are too long. You need to wait each time you buy something or switch screen.",0,1

"04OCT23 Review

This DLC seems to be the 'success' that PGI has been needing for a while. That being said, I still recommend you buy this on sale as PGI still only released a slim-budget product. All real effort went into the 15x Mission Campaign.

The specific items:
Campaign - This is one of the better campaigns I have experienced.  The starting 'Mechs are a great mix, weapon and 'Mech market availability is good, starting inventory is well-established, starting money makes you have agency, but not able to fund a whole new line-up. Missions are decently laid out and engaging. Story/Lore is a great peek at ComStar feeding the Kuritans against the FedCom Alliance with more entwined story pieces. This is a particular win for the Lore-Junkie-'Mech-Jockeys. Somehow, this is the best part.

Battlemechs: 5x Longbow, 6x OTOMO Variants of other Chassis.

Longbow - A Great Back-Line Missile Support 'Mech. All 5x variants are materially the same. Some will just have more Laser slots. Other than that, big hit box 'arms' to make sure your missile launchers are hit. This is extremely lazy and could have been augmented with another 'Mech release. I like me a Missile-boat, but come on.

Otomo - Essentially Kuritan Royal Guard Variants with all the awesome LosTech upgrades you could want. In Vanilla MW5:Mercs, that means you just have a standard weapon load with max-ish armor, a bunch of Heatsinks (doubles mainly) and Ammo slotted. I consider these variants essential demi-hero-'Mechs, which point for point, probably could out perform their Hero-Variant counter-parts. No doubt, Modders will vary this up more with internals, engine sizes, and other sweet gear to make these variants be more descriptive and enjoyable to customize.

Free Update - Instant Action fight arena with friends and teams. This could be better completed by redoing MW4 Solaris Arena, making it a mode with George Ledoux as Duncan Fisher narrating arena events. Ultimately, not a 'Free Update', more like, ""We added a feature you probably did not know about"".

Again, in summary: Buy on Sale; Campaign - Good 'nuff; Longbow - Lazy Yawn; Otomo - Hero-contenders; Free Update - Where?",1,0

"Good but frustrating

TLDR: I would enjoy this game 200% more if it was a mobile game. 

This game is like a tamagotchi that can't leave your house, which for some people who (for instance) work from home don't need to worry about. 

I don't work from home.

This game's main gimmick is that it only runs in the background for a certain amount of time, with the maximum limit being 8 hours, after which the game will stop in its tracks and does not progress. 
You can reset this, but if it ever lapses you don't progress until you reset it. 

Again, you ONLY have 8 hours maximum before the game freezes. 

There is no worse feeling than coming home from work after a long shift to get on your computer for a couple hours only to find that absolutely nothing has progressed.

This game demands an amount of attention that I am not physically able to give it often enough for things to progress at a meaningful rate that engages me enough to care about it. 

And that really sucks because otherwise this game is great, but the pacing has FULLY lost me because of the issues I've described.

I wish the game had a longer default timer, something like 12 hours would be far more reasonable.

"I had troubles with first 2 launchings of this game on my PC: I couldn't proceed further than clouds in main menu, though I heard the game sounds.  At its 1st launch the game has started to install some Microsoft program for it without my permission, I think it's weird... And a bit inappropriate.  

But ok, then I played like 2-3 times. The game seems to have quite nice graphics. 
It's sokoban type of games [in ancient Egypt/Greece setting]. 
Controls [so far] are just WSAD to go/push the crates in front of you, and ""Space"" to interact with some objects [hit crates or ballistae]. 

I was a little uncomfortable without the ability to rotate the screen, because it is not always clear where the passage is in the wall [when I could see the level from only one angle].

I played something like 10 levels, and each level was dedicated 1 new in-game feature. So, the game has good tutorial, with no rush. Loading screens before each levels have detailed description to each new in-game objects in that levels. First puzzles were easy, of course. But still quite good.
The ""campaign"" is not linear - sometimes you can choose from 4 different levels where you want to proceed.

Game description says that the levels have ""replayable"" value, but I don't think so:  I wouldn't beat these same puzzles in second time.

My FPS was only 9-10 in this game, which is terrible: each move was like the ""slow-mo""...

Futhermore, when I wanted to play today I got black screen... I tried to re-launch the game 2-3 times, it was poinless [black screen and game was not responding to me], so I'll just delete this game now...  It's too unpolished in my opinion.  ""Free"" is the max fair price for it...",1,0

"[i]""The 90's called, they want their clunky low-res pixel game back!"" - ""Why are you still trying to play this? You're not enjoying yourself. Can't you play something fun instead?""[/i]

[b]UPDATE: My main issues were promptly fixed. Leaving this review up because it shows a good dev response (see comment section) and a different opinion also on other aspects of the game. I would now recommend it more generally to people who don't mind it being retro in every way. [/b]

***

There might be a cool story there, but I didn't find it because I couldn't even figure out how to use items in my inventory. There's no info on controls besides a second-long screen when starting a new game, you can't look them up in the menu. I found moving around very tedious anyways, like finding the exact spot where you can use the hallway (?) through the apartment. The pixel graphics resolution was certainly good enough for a 90's PC, but looked pretty awful on my 21st century screen. 

I was ready to Just Ignore This game without leaving a review. What really pissed me off though was seeing that it's tagged as ""Point & Click"" when it has really clunky keyboard controls and you absolutely cannot point or click anything. This is grossly misleading and if it's a user-created tag then the devs can (and obviously should) remove it. 

Recommended only for the most dedicated retro gamers.

Look up the pyramid location change before your attempt unless you want to lose a run to one of the shittiest boss fights in any game. Otherwise the card changes are alright but not worth the price. Wait until the developers get less greedy and drop the price to around $3,0,1

Game is buggy crashes from time to time for no reason. Sex scenes are just a hand job and missionary where you cant see anything. Game plays a lot like the old final fantasy. Game play is easy and basic. Hopefully the developer finishes the job and fixes the game.,1,0

"I seldom have mixed feelings about AoE 2 DE content, I either love it, or hate it. These feelings usually come in the form my reaction to what is brought before me, regardless of the type of content which is why I could love a Civilization, but absolutely loathe a map they are strong in, for example. 

With that premise in mind I'd like to share my thoughts on the DLC, and what it brought to the table.

The things I love(d):
1. The new Civilizations. 
Great in concept, great in reality, all three Civs have introduced new (and for many, older and reluctant to change and innovation players) scary mechanics, never seen in the game before, such as the Ratha Unique Unit, or the Wootz steel tech. (which is VERY scary to face) With those in mind and all the other additions to the game thanks to these new civs, I can say the DLC is a banger and opens a lot of possibilities and roads for diversified yet consistent gameplay. This is healthy, great job devs. 

2. The changes to the game.
Addressing feedback from the community, both at the top and at the bottom of the ladder is a tricky situation to handle and sometimes you face the hurdle of the majority  of the playerbase trashing on you because one pro did one thing and suddenly their favourite thing is gone. If League of Legends (10+ million players at its peak) managed to climb such a mountain, so could the Forgotten Empires team, and they did. 
-Attack Move exploit Fixed (maybe a bit too well haha) 
-KOTD4 Arabia removed (Sorry memb, but that map got really boring really fast, despite forging people in fire.)
-Improvements to Melee unit pathing with attack move etc...
While it's true that you could argue that these changes are not related to the DLC, they certainly are, as the patch came in bundled with it and this patch took a long time to polish and make sure it worked as it should. 


Now for the bads, which aren't many, but hey. 
1.The Campaigns. 
This is a thorn in my side because the effort and dedication of map makers and scripters and Campaign devs IS ENORMOUS and it really pains me to say that I did not enjoy the campaigns. 
The stories they tell are GREAT, I love them and I really find them to be pleasant and engaging. 
The gameplay however, is decently frustrating and unfortunately not up to par to previous campaigns. 
In terms of mechanics, uniqueness and flexibility the campaigns in the Dynasties of India DLC are severely inferior to the Lords of the West and Dawn of the Dukes campaigns:
One mission of the Hauteville Campaign in example had more mechanics than the whole Dravidian Campaign, ouch. 
The Campaign AI (I played on Hard) quite blatantly cheats and/or is given a huge advantage over the player [and before anyone asks, I am 1400 on the ladder, I stomp hard AI(and get stomped by players hehe) ] in all possible given ways, either with infinite population or resources or with really annoying map cheating, which is definitely not a new thing, but in previous DLC campaigns it was either really veiled, or not present (very noticeable in AoC campaigns for comparison's sake.) 
So overall no, because of the clunkiness of certain mechanics (Mission 4 Dravidians having to be in a town to use it is no bueno) and the frustrating and not so engaging gameplay which timers aren't meant to have you enjoy a fun storytelling experience, but rather a sluggish slog through the mud of GRINDY GAMEPLAY I can't say I can recommend the Campaigns of this DLC. At least not at the hardest difficulty. Just enjoy them at moderate to avoid pointless mental fatigue. 

Saving grace: The Davepala Campaign. Given its lesser level of difficulty as a whole, the story and gameplay are quite fitting and the experience is pleasant albeit devoid of unusual mechanics (I will quote again the Hauteville campaign as a benchmark)
Babur's wasn't bad either, but nothing special or very remarkable.

All in all I can't not Recommend the DLC, it's good and everyone that worked on it deserves a lot of credit and love, despite my harsh criticism. Just don't go in and expect campaigns to stomp Jadwiga's or the Hauteville's.


EDIT JUL 28 2022: 
Changed the review from positive to Negative. 
The total lack of response from the dev team has been nothing short of appalling. 
The released Civs (which as I said before, are interesting and I like the mechanics introduced) are EXTREMELY unbalanced; The Bengali are the worst Civ ever added to the game, sporting the lowest winrate% in just 3 months since their release, while the Gurjaras are literally PAY TO WIN, being the strongest most broken faction ever added to the game. But what is really baffling is that in THREE MONTHS, T H R E E, the devs have completely IGNORED the players that have been calling for changes and fixes. For the first time ever I've witnessed to Pay to win being added to a RTS game, and it is sapping my enjoyement out of it because I'd rather resign than play another match on the ladder vs Gurjaras knowing that I won't learn anything from losing to a possibly worse player that just needs to change which button they press from the stable to win vs me. Or make 4 chakram throwers and kill my 25 pikemen in 3 volleys. 

When Lords of the west came out, both the Burgundians and the Sicilians were nerfed instantly the moment both the community and pros demanded changes to OP aspects of the civ. Here we are, still waiting for Bengali not to be a waste of space and Gurjara to not be the abomination of design that they are. Get a grip.",1,0

"This game is mostly just an ok little TD other than something that I cannot overlook personally. there is a built in way to generate infinite money on round 1 once you have around 15 skill points which makes it feel empty for me. Otherwise a decent game that has put this dev on my radar for the future.

"个人游玩下来感觉这个氏族的经济系统表现有点问题。新的体系（南方国家）在带来许多改变、增加了许多操作的同时，并没有带来足够的经济收益，导致经济运转困难（特别是在游戏前期）。主要机制-要塞建筑在增加了额外建筑费用（在前期，这是很昂贵的投入）的同时，对氏族经济状况的改善几乎不存在。不知道各位了了不了解帝国时代4，新文明拜占庭的经济地标大酒庄和这个要塞有点类似：这个建筑未来或许会提供一定的加成，但对当下的经济状况的改善几乎没有作用。考虑到要塞的建筑投入、升级费用、领主的招募费用，这种投入产出比是完全无法接受的。领地要塞对领地生产的提升应当是立即生效且提升显著的，而不是在经过几百天的漫长时间才得到一个不算大的提升。

当下的设计似乎是用前期较高的投入和相对困难的发展换取后期的繁荣，但在我看来，Northgard是一个控图控资源的游戏，氏族发展扩张的顺畅是很重要的。没有前期良好的经济表现，就不会有快速的领地扩张带来的生存空间和资源获取，就不会有后期了。

综上，我不推荐这个氏族，希望制作组能够做些调整，改善这个氏族的游玩体验。但最后我还是要感谢制作组一直以来为这款游戏付出的时间与精力，感谢你们一直更新这款游戏，他真的很棒。

English version：

After playing this clan, I felt that there was something wrong with the economic system of it. While the new system (Southern Countries) brought many changes and added many operations, it did not bring enough economic benefits, leading to difficulties in economic development (especially in the early stages of the game). The main structure - fortress adds additional building costs (which is expensive in the early stages), but its improvement to the clan's economy is almost non-existent. It may provide some bonuses in the future, but it doesn't improve current economic conditions. Considering the construction investment, upgrade costs, and lord recruitment costs of the fortress, this investment-output ratio is completely unacceptable. The improvement of production by territorial fortress should be effective immediately and obviously, rather than a small improvement after hundreds of days.

In the current design, the players will endure the high investment and relatively difficult development in the early game for the prosperity in the late game. But in my personal opinion, Northgard is a game focuses on the control of territory and resources, and the smooth expansion and development of the clan is very important. Without good economic performance in the early stage, there would be no living space and resource brought by rapid territorial expansion, and consequently there would be no later stage.

To sum up, I do not recommend this clan (especially if you play this game alone). I hope the production team can make some adjustments to improve the early-game performance of this clan. But in the end, I still want to thank the production team for the time and energy they have devoted into this game. Thank you all for updating this game in these years. Northgard and most DLC are really good. :)",1,0

"Get it if you’re a fan of the genre, but others need to stay away.

You don’t need to look twice at the images to realize the game falls into the rage platformer genre. The goal of these games is to climb up by jumping on random objects floating in the air. There are no save spots or checkpoints, and if you drop over the edge, you will fall all the way down. 

Since it’s losing popularity because they all look the same, developers try new ways to stand out. One of them is to replace the human characters with all kinds of other, more ridiculous options.

This game decided to use karts and bikes. Both have a variety of skins, but the impact is solely visual. However, because there are just two wheels instead of four, the bike feels a little simpler to handle on narrow platforms. Controls are standard for a driving game, which means platforming is complicated.

You have the following controls: throttle, brake, jump, and turbo. Because you can't easily turn your vehicle the way you can turn human characters, you'll have to tread carefully while using reverse and forward. Physics engine is generous so you won’t fall down because of a tiny bump. 

The low-poly graphics are pretty nice and objects don’t stand out due to different art style. The bad part is the camera. While the camera may be rotated around the car, it cannot be turned down or up. This makes it impossible to see where you’re going. Most of the time, you're forced to jump blindly and hope for the best.  

You’ll either give it a go for five minutes or play it for hours until you get to the top.",0,1

"💜 This game was gifted to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/catizens/curation][b]Catizens Curations[/b][/url] for review.

Desktop Pet Project is, as it's name implies, a classic desktop pet program where you can interact with your pc and do other things while cute little cats roam your screen. You can have up to four different pets on your screen at the same time, though it would be fun if there was no limit. I am glad that the dev decided to increase the limit to four atleast!

The phone, or more commonly known as the main menu, is a window you can access by right clicking the pet on the screen. From there you are able to do various things such as summon different items, play minigames, change the settings, etc. etc. It is a cool little way of adding a menu to the game, but there isn't much to do either way.

At it's current stage, the game seems to be a little lacking in most departments. It doesn't have any sound effects for the pet; it doesn't make any sounds while it roams, eats or plays. There is a few different ways you can interact with the pet, such as a sleeping pillow, a basket ball and some different kinds of foods, definitely some that cats don't eat, which ruins the immersion for me.

The cat can summon windows of memes on your screen to let you know what it wants, though the images on them don't always make sense and aren't always clear on what it needs are. I kind of wished there would have been a needs window in the menu somewhere, which would have indicated what the pet wants, but no such luck for me. There is other few kinds of things you can do with your pet, but I don't really feel like writing about them too much.

Sadly due to all these things, I feel like the game lacks too much interactivity and longevity, and I feel like I can't really recommend the game. I wish steam had a middle way of voting for the game, as I feel like that would sum up my feelings on it currently the best. I do hope the developers will keep making the game better and including updates for it, and if that does happen I will keep you guys updated.",1,0

"Middle of the road for this game. Great idea and very similiar to Football manager. Just a few things that definitely need to be fixed. This game will be great after a few fixes down the line. Its a pretty good start, since basketball management games have sucked for awhile (IBM was horrible, Pro Day Sports is buggy as hell and makers dont care.)


Pros:

- A lot of leagues and alot of choices. Something I like about games like Football Manager. Gives us alot of choices for starting point.

- Interface is not bad

- Simming is pretty quick. Can play season in 30 minutes.

- Tactics are great, do wish there more options for offense and defense. Pretty simplified.

- Training is simple, not too complicated

Cons:

- Zero Continuity in Finances. Seems finances are kind of wonky. Playing in Luxembourg, made decent amount of money, so figured we would get some money next season. But it seems the finances and budget just resets and starting over. I decided to test giving a team wads of money, turns out that money just goes away. So give a team 200 million, wait until last day of season, it will just reset back to 1.9 mil budget.

- Should be some sort of explanation or tutorial about NBA drafting players from leagues. I just signed a player with no release cause who had a 4 year deal. 3 days later, I see that he was drafted by NBA and off to the team, seemingly just jumping to NBA and violating his contract he just signed.

- Game has some serious issues, glitches and bugs that definitely render game unplayable at times. Prime example was Italian league, which AI teams just stopped signing players, young players leaving junior teams and not generating new players. Maybe few were being generated, but doubt it. So Italian league had 6-9 teams that did not have enough players, so they forfeited games in Year 3 or 4. It got so bad, that every other game was a forfeit. 

- Morale works very strange: One guy will complain about not being good enough and asking for a loan, after that he reset back to being normal. Never asked for a loan again even in next seasons.  

- Speaking of loans..Not that I had to worry, AI doesnt offer loans to players. It would be nice to have a function like football manager where you can offer loans to teams.

- Players dont retire it seem. I noticed in editor it was deceased or retired function. But I saw a 47 year old dude on a team and few 43 year old free agents just lurking around. 

- I signed a contract with Serie Legadue team and logged off. When I decided to play again, I was a free agent. It was nearly impossible to get another job. There has to be a notification when jobs open up. The player left blind to figure out what positions are open.

Few bright spots in this game, but damn before anyone spends their money, some things need to be fixed before I recommend to have anyone buying this game.  Its a good start for a sports management game that has too many bad games.",1,0

"Other than all of the the mini games being way to easy, the game does what it promises. After pressing 'w' a bunch, you'll eventually get all of the achievements that give you more customization options for your profile. You tell me if that's worth 99 cents though.

EDIT: Steam has yet to recognize the achievements, at least for me, meaning they don't show up as an option on my steam profile.

"= Eye of the Beholder
Tagline: ""These Locks & Traps are too Good.""
Year: 1991
Developer: Westwood Associates/Westwood Studios (Electronic Arts)
Publisher: Strategic Simulations (SSI)
Genre: 1-Player 3D Dungeon Crawler

The First of Three Games in the Eye of the Beholder Trilogy & like Tiny Tina Wonderlands along with Tiny Tina Dragon's Keep is also based or inspired by the Dungeon & Dragons Tabletop RPG Series. You CAN'T just charge into this game like any other game because every decision you make will count throughout each branching paths you encounter such as ""Heading into the Mountains or Enter a Town, Enlist Help or Proceed Alone"", just to name a few. Considering that this is NOT a Typical RPG as it uses a Tabletop RPG Ruleset being the AD&D Second Edition & you have only ONE Save Slot so you have to plan your move carefully, plan ahead & think before selecting your options.

As for the Story, its set in the World of Waterdeep, where over 1,000 Years ago, it was once a Harboring Town for Merchants until it grew into a Prosperous Kingdom with plenty of inhabitants ruled by a High Council. However, reports of assassins and unrest are on the rise by a Force of Darkness. After many attempts to locate this Dark Force, its not coming from Outside but from within Waterdeep itself either from the Sewer Systems or Deeper than that. To combat this Dark Force, the Council summons a group of Champions & your party appears before Waterdeep with the details complete with a Job Request with the details of where the Dark Force is coming from & how the Underground is the Source along with a Marking from the Guild that makes the Job Official & Grants your party full rights to any and all treasures. However, this Dark Force is making plans as after your party enters the Sewers, the doors seal behind you & cave in. Since the only way out is Forwards, its up to you and your party of Champions to defeat this Dark Force.

"if you are a first time player of old school rpg's, thus might be a great game. it's simple, straightforward, and easily completed in under ten hours. for more experienced game players, it's a cake walk for a day of just sitting back and killing things. 
the towns are small and there aren't a lot of people to talk to. the items available for purchase are reasonably priced. you don't get attacked on the world map. the baddies don't repopulate... no grinding and you don't really need it. i finished the game with over fifty thousand gold in the bank! 
did i enjoy playing? of course! but was it a WOW experience? i think not. apart from it's simplicity, it also has no replayability.
that being said i truly love aldorlea games and i will continue purchase games from them in the future.",1,0

"Lols ahahaaa it's funny how you always die... on any path ofc you can accept the fate, or you can fight on which will lead to 1 less choice... then when you have no choices you have to give up, the way this game is built is you actually cannot die as it will never save you in a death as you start or load a new one, and if you fight on then yeah you do have to do all 3, there is 4 endings really. Kinda funny how in all of them you do tasks for them and they seem to care for you but in 2 of them you go to sleep and wake up trapped somehow, so your literally dead by daylight only in the mermaid one ahahaa. Since it likely is night also on the 4th one meh your dead by daylight in that one, maybe all of them are at night as you can't confirm the time in two of them so maybe it's always midnight I suppose like some kinda ritual. Either way it's basically ""Pure Reading"" minus maximum of very few opportunities to actually make any choices ever. Woulda been nice had there been choices that lead to new endings and even secret endings, or start in 1 choice but via a few other choices crossed over into any of the other 2 choices at that point of the story just ideas...",0,1

"Experimentation is a visual novel that tends toward the horror aspect of life, but the story(s) drags on next to still imagery, and that is very scary! While the price point is amazingly cheap, so is the game or lack of one.

I had to explore a menu and its horrors just to figure out how to get the menu into English. That was more action packed then the entire chapter of the MIRROR. While playing the MIRROR, I had text change a few times into other languages while in the middle of the story. Not to mention that it felt like an eternity having to read though that story. Would have been better with narration and moving imagery or animations, but looking to the bright side I was able to nap right after playing the first chapter! And so I DID

I know that all games are worth playing, and I did so for about about 20 mins. When it was over I decided that playing Experimentation would never happen again.

"Pretty disappointed that the remastered songs are identical to the original ones, and that most of the new ones don't really hit outside of a couple. 

It doesn't help that the music was spoiled in all of rorr trailers so I was expecting a bit more. 

Theres also how the music has shifted from being something you can listen to by itself, and now it feels very videogamey",1,0

"If you want more songs go ahead, but keep in mind that about half of the music videos (3d animated) aren't animated by the team that made the base game songs, so if you like the polished and smooth videos you are going to be half dissapointed like me. It's a real pity, (I don't want to blame the animators or anything) I expected some nice videos and smooth animations; most of the songs are bizarre (You'll see) and the animation makes it more bizarre, choppy and frames where the models are static only moving their mouths and eyes, and lots, lots, LOTS of slowmotion to hide the lack of animation movement in the videos. I don't want to hate on anybody, but It's my honest opinion. Thanks for your time",0,1
