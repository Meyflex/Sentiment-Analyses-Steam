"Love the game! Honesty only have one major issue with it in my eye. It is the 10 day time limit!  They really do themselves a disservice with this time crunch and making following the main quest a mandatory thing. I just can't recommend it due to that. 

Devs. Please get rid of this time crunch also allow for a new game + to just coast and appreciate the game.",0,1

"I actually like the game, but it is far from finished and still needs a lot of work. At the moment, there is only one part of the first chapter in the campaign, as well as a challenge mode with 3 maps, each with their own enemy layout. But if you are the hopeful or interested type that enjoys Resident Evil-like games (and sexy characters), you will maybe enjoy this one.

I would recommend it, but there is still many things to be desired. Below is a list of ideas, some more important than others of course. It should more serve as food for thought for the creator if he ever sees this review.

-A ""Swap Shoulder"" function to switch the camera position from the right shoulder to the left
-Better melee combat that doesn't rely on stunlocking the enemy
-Viable I-frames during dodging
-Prevention of player stunlock
-The fact that the character should swap to the weapon instead of empty hands after using an item
-Being able to move while healing even if slowly
-Removing that weird standing around and doing nothing at the end of the healing animation
-Being able to run more than just a few meters without being out of breath immediately
-Better placement of autosaves in the campaign (There is only one right at the start before any danger, thus eliminating most of the point of it other than being able to skip cutscenes)
-Possibly a mode that removes autosaves in favor of saving at savepoints manually, like Resident Evil
-Better enemy placement in the campaign (There is way too many for it to be scary, it just turns into a really bad shootout that requires you to have saved up ammo from the challenge modes)
-Actual riddles for the safes instead of having it written in the room somewhere, possibly having it written somewhere else for the player to find instead
-Being able to carry over the clothing you selected in your room into a campaign save you made already
-Having an ""unlocked clothing"" screen instead of just the clothes you have in your inventory
-Not having to save the clothing inside a box, there is currently no need for that because you will only ever change your clothes in front of a mirror that is in a safe room
-More reason to use the box other than to carry over items from one mode into the other
-More character sliders than just the waist and the breasts, and more options than just hair, hair color, clothing and general facial appearance
-More modes with possible permanent upgrades or unlocks to the character in them

And last and most importantly:
-Better communication with the playerbase

Some or all of these ideas are possibly already planned, but I have no way of knowing this without better communication with the playerbase. Unless that happens, communicating with the creator happens via these reviews... Unless of course you can read Chinese, I can't. I do hope that this review gets taken to heart, and I do hope that I can change the recommendation from No to Yes at some point. But that's where we are right now.",1,0

"Just purchased this table and so far it's just OK. Other than the great, happy music by the great Vince Guaraldi, the constant depressing comments from Charlie Brown about how no one wants to send him a Christmas card, and how no one likes him totally kills what could have been a happy and fun table celebrating the classic animated story. So far, I've found it quite depressing to play.",1,0

"[h1]Wellington's [url=store.steampowered.com/app/1874220/GO/]GO[/url] mixes elements of brick breaker and pool in a relaxing minimalist package but lacks thoughtful strategic design.[/h1]

Break the whites and bounce off on blacks. Some pieces move, most are static.

With a mirror effect on screen edges, most of the 100 puzzles are either easy one-shot solves or fall into the trial-and-error category. You can let some levels run for 2 whole minutes and just watch the ball bounce off randomly until it clears all the pieces. Coupled with the occasional glitch, this makes solving puzzles rather unsatisfying.

For the tougher levels, I would have liked to see my last move's position before attempting another correction.

Go presumably took strong inspiration from Kamibox Games' more polished [i]Okay?[/i]. Okay is more musical and has more diverse elements (such as strings that make sounds but don't disappear). Go relies on screen mirroring to solve its puzzles while Okay does not. Yet the similarities are otherwise striking beyond coincidence, both in terms of concept and presentation.

[h1]Positive[/h1]
[list]
[*] Nice minimalist aesthetic
[*] Relaxing
[*] Very affordable
[/list]

[h1]Negative[/h1]
[list]
[*] Puzzles can get solved by accident with the ball going off-screen without limits in ways that were clearly not intended
[*] No options to reset progress or replay previous puzzles
[*] Ball occasionally passes through solid blocks
[*] Derivative of another indie title without improving the formula

"Really wanted to like it. HLD one of my fav games of all time. It seems to lack so much of the depth and soul that I found in HLD. Style reminds me of Monument Valley. Remarkable at first, but ultimately without substance and grit. A game that non-gamers can get excited about. I think the game Gris was more successful with this floating dream style. Abilities are just handed out from the get go as if you're playing a sequel. Was content sliced here? Also the abilities are fairly easy to use ( You watch the character animate through final movements of sequences. Just sit back and watch... zzzzZZ )  which makes them feel unearned... I wish Heart Machine the best with their coming titles. Fundamentally a game has to be fun.",1,0

"Although I was gifted the game, I feel ripped off. Of course the game is a little better if you didn't play it originally, but what's a gamer to do?They're not going to buy a copy on a site like Steam if they know they're going to have to pay for it again, right? Take it off the site. This is where you'll encounter the most issues. I'm not going to delve into the deep end of things, so let's just assume you've purchased and downloaded the it and it's playing normally. All is good, right? Wrong. Right after installing and setting it up, you've got the only content you should be seeing: it should be displaying the word download! A cold chill went down my spine as I eagerly waited for the big question: What is the bird going to do? You do not want to see this. It will pop up and slowly slink across the screen. All you'll see is the bird spinning. It slowly spins into a different picture while asking you if you want to download the map. If you decide yes, the next image you're going to see is this:Once this happens, the image is immediately after: Once the download has been completed, you should be presented with this image to your left:Alright. The download has been complete and you can now download the map. But I've heard of such horror stories as spiders and falling objects. The last thing I wanted was to download it and crash out with it on my PC. I made sure the game was clean and nothing of suspicious nature was downloaded, and then I rebooted my computer. Before I went back to the program to continue playing, I had to leave the room. It's not that I was afraid of the game.",0,1

"Do not go in expecting this to be a full island like the rest or you'll probably wind up disappointed. If you've already beaten the game and don't intend to replay it like I had, I don't think this is worth buying. There would be a lot more value here if you actually plan to use some of the upgrades you unlock as you play through the rest of the game, but as a standalone piece of content it's quite lacking.

The story is cool and then just abruptly ends, I didn't even know I was finished with the DLC until looking it up. For some reason this island doesn't really seem to care if you catch any of the fish or not. If I remember correctly there are literally no quests tied to the fish of the island. It's just a baffling decision because those quests cannot take a lot of time to implement and really make up the core of the gameplay experience to me. I figured you were just supposed to do a couple quests first and then you would unlock a new rod to catch the fish and get some quests relating to them, but no. I probably beat half the DLC before I had caught a single new fish because I didn't realize you can just buy a rod that can catch them with seemingly no requirement to unlock.

This only gets a recommend from me just because I love the base game so much. If you're on a first playthrough or plan to play through the whole game again after buying the DLC, you'll probably have a better experience, but it's really not a lot of content even for the cheap price.",0,1

"Not that I would't recommend this game, but there are a few things that could be done much better. I feel quite neutral as far this game goes. For example, the classic clue rules make it impossible for the player to conduct a second investigation within the same room. In this game you can. Second, it would be great to add a chat in order for the players to know whether there's a problem. Also I have the feeling, not really every player is an actual player. They're recognizable becuase they don't have a customized ID.",0,1
"It was a solid experience, first time playing this 15-year-old mod that I never got to experience before, and it ran alright on a 2060 (with some choppy areas). As much as I loved the ray-tracing experience that I was expecting for, I sometimes found myself struggling on certain chambers that require little to no mistake to execute, making the experience a headache to deal with. I've also found myself stuck on a section with no idea what to do, having to look up how to clear that segment.

I'm not judging this game based on the graphics or visuals, but rather on the gameplay and puzzles themselves. After all, this is a free mod, so I'm not being as critical as I would be.",1,0

"Highly Recommended.

Zi Xao - the Owl guy - is a pretty poor choice for the game. While he has the potential to be very powerful as a damage dealer, he is also incredibly inconsistent and relies heavily on chance scrolls to supplement his poor vitality. You cant CONTROL how his power works, it's very much a gamble. After hours of gameplay, I still don't know exactly how it works - it's very poorly communicated and gameplay aspects are not obvious.

Weapons - The weapons add a good variety for the game. It's amazing that a relatively small studio can create more weapon assets and mechanics than most AAA guys.Wolf Gaze is a particularly helpful weapon in less versatile builds.

But there's one reason why you [i][b]ABSOLUTELY[/b][/i]should get this DLC:
[h3]Nona[/h3]

Iron Wing and Nona's rocket completely break the game. It's easy mode. Getting into a lobby where multiple people have upgraded Iron Wings can stomp even the most challenging foes.
When played in a group - we had a lot of difficulty facing the more difficult foes, but then we switched to Nona and it was a cakewalk.
She's fun, addictive, a great way to grind, and can boost even the most inefficient players.

Nona is [i]Gunfire Reborn[/i]'s easy mode.

"While the writing continues to be compelling, expansive, and thrilling, there are STILL noticeable bugs/sections in the Part that falter the suspension of disbelief. 
These ARE potentially ground-breaking for a game that is entirely Narrative. 

*Within 'The Museum' sections especially, Tommy/Bailey/Lopez are often excluded from descriptions or dialogue and then suddenly reappear in the scene, or a Group member can die and suddenly be alive again n such *bugs. 
*Or like Bailey is shot, and suddenly she is no longer in the scene AT ALL. But when you get back into camp apparently she is still a group member....and nothing was explained or elaborated about her injuries.
*or the entire task/building/improvements system for the Junkyard; tasks can be completed but will continue to show up both within options to start tasks, and to continue working on said tasks. Also improvement effects don't seem to be fully operational, and the descriptions of completed tasks or in-progress tasks does seem to be lacking in parts/buggy as well. 
This system just feels broken in this part, while with the original Zombie Exodus game, and with both Part I and II of Zombie Exodus: Safe Haven this system is PHENOMENAL and creates an awesome building up your 'Safe Haven' aspect to the gameplay, in this part it just feels hollow, barebones, and buggy. 

Just needs some TLC and more description around and within the improvement system and to fix the existing 'buggy-ness' and it will be GREAT.

"It amazes me to think how many people truly believe that they understand the meaning of pain. They wail about petty grievances and trifling discomforts while swaddled in their Miffy the Rabbit blankets, thinking themselves worthy of commiseration. 'I have pancreatic cancer,' they cry; 'my dad makes me call him ""Honeypuff""', they lament. 

I curse these squalling babes. Every last one of them is irredeemable, save by the act of crawling in shame back into their mother's womb and cannibalising the slattern from within, as punishment for ever daring to bring them into a world not made for their kind.

My anguish, conversely, spans decades, and runs through my blood from the uttermost depths of my being. I have sworn fealty to the realm of Dransik since the beginning. Twenty years I served, languishing beneath swarms of bats and the molestations of giant spiders in search of higher purpose. Never before had pixels so bestirred my heart. Here were forged the most enduring and meaninful friendships of my life. And even in this unforgiving land of magma and impenetrable woodland teeming with carnivorous squirrels, betimes love did blossom, and my paramours and I gambolled about the meadows, petting sheep and smelling what were, if one squinted, most likely flowers. 

A life without Dransik was not one I could bear to contemplate. Alas, entropy is but one of many symptoms of the disease we name life, and sooner or later, the greatest of humanity's works all fall prey to rot. What exists on Steam today is merely a shadow of Dransik's former splendour. Gone are the early morning 200 player orgies, gone are the seal parades, gone is the thriving economy fuelled by the slave labour of hapless new players. It is a husk, a barren shell, an ensemble of bones dancing on puppet strings held by the careless and incompetent. 

Abandon all hope ye who enter here. Dransik is dead. Joy is dead. And soon I shall follow suit.",1,0

"I love playing the game, through there are many glitches that are very frustrating. The good thing is that if you die-you just go to a previous save. The bad thing is that things disappear between save and load. I bought the vehicle, never drove it yet (because I built my home at the kiosk), I went hunting for supply drops on foot with SMG and ammo.  My keys locked up  so I could not load my rifle, nor select any other weapon, so I ran away. The NPCs continued chasing me with endless supply of magazine ammo (Totally needs to be fixed). I died. When I reloaded last save, I still had a vehicle, but I may as well have parked it in the Hood. no wheels and no gas glitch.  Sometimes when I load a  saved game, all my weapons and ammo are missing out of my chests and inventory. Probably other items too, but it is the weapons that are hardest to come by.  If you select to drink at the rivers, be careful. I you click on  E at any time, the world becomes a deep lake that you will have to try to swim into the sky  and far away from the river to get out. When you do, you will be well above ground and need to walk down to earth (but I did not risk drowning).  I look around to ensure  no one is around me anywhere before opening  a chest  or bag, and NPCs seem to suddenly just spawn beside me trying to kill me - you can't always see them coming.   The greatest saving grace is that you can often defend yourself, even from armed NPCs with just a few good spears, easy to make and use.  food and water are accessible more realistically.  I quit a while everytime a glitch kills me, but I am always drawn back to start again! lol",0,1

"Genuinely might be the best Battle Royale game ever made. The mechanics, the jokes, the balance! Every weapon is S tier with the right play style, they all can be incredible strong in the right positioning.

The driving from town to town is easily my favorite Battle Royale arena shrinking/moving. It moves players into combat in ways other Battle Royales fail to do. It does it without feeling unfair, like a Zone in something like PUBG/Warzone/Fortnite/Apex can be. And it avoids massive boring camping in games that are sorta Battle Royales like Hunt Showdown and Tarkov.

The Horse mechanics are hilarious. The fact the goofy, hard to control, Mario Kart parody horse riding is not only funny, but has a genuine high skill cap to it is great. The fact you can learn the controls, learn the routes, and find little ways to cut time off a trip was so genuinely fun to do between gunfights for me. It became more fun than the gun play for a good amount of my playtime.

Match vs Menu times are probably the best of any Battle Royale .There is something absolutely amazing about this games queue taking seconds, followed by the game itself being ready to start in seconds.  Even when you lose, it doesn't feel like a big deal because a game could start again in literally 10 seconds. Not find a match in 10 seconds, or load. I mean START.

Ofcourse it was riddled with bugs and glitches. Rarely was a bug game breaking and not in the first 5 seconds of a match, where it really didn't feel bad to just requeue.

Hackers were pretty rare but did exist. Usually seemed to be people just having fun with breaking the game. Never had the player base to really pull script kiddie hacking into it.

Unfortunately I have to give this game a thumbs down even though I have pretty much nothing but praise for it.
It's dead. No player base. I really hope Landfall changes the game to Free again. I feel like a Free To Play sequel with a little polish and a pay to customize character shop could be a great. Again, please Landfall make this game free to play. Otherwise it's just dead.  You can't even see all the towns because you spawn left to right, and nobody spawns on the right side of map anymore since the lobbies aren't full.",1,0

"Experimentation is a visual novel that tends toward the horror aspect of life, but the story(s) drags on next to still imagery, and that is very scary! While the price point is amazingly cheap, so is the game or lack of one.

I had to explore a menu and its horrors just to figure out how to get the menu into English. That was more action packed then the entire chapter of the MIRROR. While playing the MIRROR, I had text change a few times into other languages while in the middle of the story. Not to mention that it felt like an eternity having to read though that story. Would have been better with narration and moving imagery or animations, but looking to the bright side I was able to nap right after playing the first chapter! And so I DID

I know that all games are worth playing, and I did so for about about 20 mins. When it was over I decided that playing Experimentation would never happen again.

"This game has potential. It definitely isn't there yet, but hopefully the dev continues to improve things. It's a fun, casual tower defense game at its core, but there's just not enough to truly recommend it. Gameplay is too linear, lacks complexity, and becomes repetitive in the late game. You build enough lightning towers and star towers with archers as DPS, then you go into maintenance mode to make sure you have enough mana. I would like to see more variety in towers, alternate tower abilities, tier levels, and more upgrades. The research early game is too slow and if you miss out on crucial cards (Library, Pylon, Furnace, Swamp...) then you'll have to wait forever for them to reappear via RNG. These required cards shouldn't be part of the draw. It hinders gameplay, creating a bad experience. It's not a challenge.

Then there are some minor issues. The star and lightning towers are too powerful. The radius of the speed tower and the towers it affects isn't clear. It should highlight the towers that are within the radius. And the game should go on longer than 50 levels. I had no trouble on Medium difficulty to beat the game on my second try. I might go for a third game on Hard difficulty, but I don't feel motivated to do so due to the lack of variety in gameplay. Maybe the dev is mistaking RNG for gameplay variety and challenge. I don't know.

Anyway, it's a decent game. I'd like to see some improvements fleshing things out and balancing the game overall. I'll come back around for updates.",0,1

"OK where to start with this game.
I understand it's an indie title, but for crying out loud, did the dev actually play any type of racing sim/game? I highly doubt it!
Firstly, the control system, what were you thinking???

No reverse gear, but rather hit R to respawn, which ive noticed people spam and cause all sorts of mayhem in corners.

Secondly, ZERO mouse support for smooth steering and acc/dec using mouse buttons, over correction in racing games is a no no.

Thirdly, why the hell would you implement serious slow down while running over grass or general off track?

Menu system is all over the place. 

Steering is overall really janky and myself and many others in-game are over correcting and crashing, it needs to be much smoother... and dont get me started on the braking dynamics...

Apart from that, graphically it's ok and playable... sound wise well... meh.. they just sound like stock sounds ( i work as a professional sound designer so i can tell)

"I have very mixed feelings leaving this review. On the one hand, I love Muv-Luv and I am ecstatic to even see ""The Imperial Capital Burns"" on Steam - so many thought it'd never come. On the other hand, I feel like every port just gets worse. I just spent 45 min just trying to get full screen to work. Go to full screen and you'll see the words get cut off - fixed to screen option on or off, it doesn't matter. Re-launching the game with full screen results in a black picture with music. It's ridiculous and so obvious, any QA should have picked this up. I eventually got Fullscreen working using the Borderless Gaming app. 

I guess I must be a sucker for Muv-Luv though, because for all that I hate how aNCHOR handles these releases, I'll keep throwing my money at them just hoping they'll give us all of Muv-Luv.

"(HEADS UP: This review was written on the day of release. Things may have changed between release and the time you are seeing this, so take these things with a grain of salt as they may have been fixed by the time you read this.)

This game is very much a mixed bag for me. Many of my issues are personal preferences and gripes, however this is my review, so I will list those here. This monster of a review will be split into multiple parts, so for the dumbed down version, scroll to the bottom, although for more specifics, I definitely recommend reading the whole thing.

*Graphics/Performance:* Now, this game is styled to look like something out of an early PS1 game, meaning the graphics by todays standards are not greatest, however, that is the style the game is going for, so I have no complaints there. My complaints are with the game's performance. For a game with such low poly textures and models (At least from what is visible through all the screen effects), trying to run this game on a Mac like me, on any setting higher than ""Low"" is unbearable. The game stutters like crazy and just runs really slow unless you're on a low setting and even then, it still still has fps drops. (For reference, I can run games like ""The Forest"" just fine with little to no FPS drops ever). The original Lancaster leak had this same problem, but it was a lot worse, so there seems to have been an effort to fix this. Either way, I give the graphics a good 7/10, and the performance a 4/10.

*Controls:* This game has tank controls, which for a lot of people could be an immediate turn off. For me tank controls are a little annoying but I can bear them. The problem with this however, is the fact that if you are walking towards the camera, your controls will inverse, so instead of turning right you will turn left for example. It's not a huge thing but gets really annoying at times. Overall I give the controls a 5/10

*Gameplay:* Another little gripe I have with this game is the gameplay. This game is comprised of multiple fetch quests. However the original Lancaster Leak was a glorified walking simulator so either way this is an improvement. But in the original I could excuse the lack of any real gameplay because of how excellently done the horror element was, but in this game, the horror element is kind of lackluster. I did not once find the entity scary, as there was never a moment in the game where it could actually kill you if it you were chased, and it only ever showed up during scripted sequences, making it seem much less scary. I would have loved if there was a portion of the game where the entity was wandering around, and you had to hide in lockers or something whenever it walked by, however that would require a much larger map, so it probably would not have worked. I give the gameplay a 7/10. It was fun for the first 10 or so minutes, but then it got very repetitive.

*Lore/Story:* This is the game's saving grace. The lore is very intriguing and the entity description and how the story was presented is absolutely perfect. On top of that the voice acting is absolutely incredible, it is seriously impressive the emotion that the character managed to convey in the very few lines they had. I give this section a 10/10

*Conclusion:* Overall, this game is a 6.6/10. The graphics fit the theme of the game, however the performance is absolutely atrocious at times, which takes away from it, the controls are annoying and janky, and the gameplay is very mediocre (However it is still an improvement over the gameplay from the last one). This game is absolutely saved by it's very well presented story. While it does have it's problems, it's only worth it due to the fact that it is free. If this even cost a dollar, I would say its not worth the money, dont buy it, but like I said it's free. So yeah, 6.6/10.

                                                                     -- BUGS/PROBLEMS --
-During the first appearance of the entity, the character does not look at it when it plays the weird frightened animations, which takes away from the immersion.

-During the ending cutscene, where the entity kills everybody in the call center, you can see both the hands of the entity and the hands of the body clipping through the exit door in the alley camera angle.

-You can grab the meeting room trash through the wall.

-There are multiple typo's throughout the many text sections of the game.",0,1

"It's good BUT it's pushing away some potential playerbase due to a swarm of info dump way too fast.

I play Yu-Gi-OH and Magic and various other card games with a lot of text and complicated interactions but this game despite having less information dump than the other 2 specific card games mentioned, has a massive information on par with a TCG Rulebook while not including decent information that can cause confusion all because everything important and key to the game is info slammed in a poor raw text format all at once.

What can be done to improve this?
Easy. Just slow down the info injection mind flaying. Ease the information to when we encounter it rather than throw it all at us before we even can actually care about it.

Dismantling stuff? don't care until I actually need to.

Forge and signs? Why are these even being shown to new people when we should't/can't do anything about it yet?
Just make it hidden until necessary like greying it out and replacing it with the text of when we can/should access it. That would give the player less info dump at the very start and give them something to look forward to o new players get a feeling to work to earn something to increase their first play session of the game.

The tiny some-what hidden encyclopedia icon at the top left?
Hide all information in it until we need to care about it and have the information on it show up ""WHEN"" we encounter it for the first time. At which time, the information of that should pop-up mid-game.
Makes the book a ""Reminder"" menu.

Small Information isn't even provided as well which can confuse people only because the game drops a fat load of important information way too fast which causes the rather minor details that aren't really needing a info mention to overwhelm people before they give it a proper try causing a pointless barrier to entree that most new card game devs tend to overlook specifically because card game devs tend to have a basic understanding of card game logic. However, slowing down how much information is given at once and slowing it down a little bit helps a lot wit getting new players into the game especially in a world where currently people don't really give much time to try anything and tend to quit forever after 5-10 minutes at most usually.

In short, slowing down on the info dump and preventing people from seeing certain information when it isn't yet necessary nor even seen yet will greatly improve how long new players, including those not used to in-depth card games or card games in general will stay active playing the game while also increasing the playtime of their first session if forge, signs and info in the Manual were hidden as to give them a sense of early-meta progression all from a single first run.",0,1

So clearly steam glitched it and I had to figure out how to unglitch it but I was too tired last night to rewrite this :)

I haven't played it yet but  It should be amazing then again who knows? Free DLC is free though.

The way you prevent the glitch as far as I understand it is one of two ways:

the thing I did: 
   -- Open properties under the game in steam, open the dlc tab, uncheck Of Flesh and Faith then recheck it, it should then start downloading for real. 

the thing others have said:
   -- verify your files (also under properties) and it should start downloading. As tihis isn't what I did not sure about it.",0,1

Yes, the graphics are pretty basic, but I was willing to set that aside to see if maybe the story was interesting. For some brief moments, I would read something that made me laugh or possibly like a character more. But in the end, it was hard to get past the parts of the story that were not well written. I will say though, it wasn't a waste of six hours for me. I now have a better idea of what I'm looking for in indie RPGs.",1,0

Which is neat, don't get me wrong, but I would have loved to see more platforming levels that are more challenging than what the game has currently.

"This game is really fun, but as many others are saying, the time crunch aspect of the game really weighs down on all other points. It's a nonstop scramble to find resources, upkeep potions, talk with characters, attempt to make the potions again, and repeat. It's got an insane potential to be really fun *IF* there was a more lenient time scheme. I can see how players would improve a lot between each replay, but the time it takes to rebuild your business is monotonous in comparison to how fast the gameplay is, leading to a lot of waiting when you're redoing a previous save, and stress when it suddenly gets harder.

I consider myself fairly okay at these sorts of things, and okay with multitasking, but even still at the 2nd competition I was roadblocked because I didn't manage to get the right ingredients. 
The major issues that could be adjusted to allow for less skilled players to enjoy the game:
-A difficulty slider to expand the time between challenges so you don't feel overwhelmed every waking moment, OR more actions in a day. Honestly this would be just as fun if not more if the deadlines were monthly, giving a LOT of chill time to practice and build progress like Stardew Valley
-Easier opponents/more cards in a deck/less aggressive stress system. Early on, the game is a breeze, with the first challenge being a minor problem. However everything dominoes if you can't make a proper potion for the event (which also is judged in a specific order, so if your last potion is the best, it might not go that long). Once you don't have a potion that surpasses the best expectations, it just becomes a Sisyphean struggle to maybe win the challenge with your haggling skills.
-Recipe saving. Similar to a different game on steam called 'Potion Craft', this game has you toss ingredients into a cauldron and you have to mix and match them based on what attributes they have. It's... not too bad, but it can get confusing when you're managing the main 3 potions for each round and you're constantly out of one ingredient or so. It would be IDEAL if you could save successful ingredient combinations to potion recipes so it automatically puts it together for you, saving time dramatically.",0,1

"It's a free tower defense game that works, so it's pretty hard to give it a negative rating, but after many hours I have no choice but to give it exactly that.

I will however say this: I recommend it if you can deal with the cons:

1. Towers are bugged across the board and can only target the closest enemy to themselves. Using any other firing mode makes the towers just sit there without firing a single shot.

2. You need to gather EVERY SINGLE GAME! It's extremely tedious in my opinion. You start by gathering 30 sticks, rocks and whatever else. Then you build your starting towers, workbench and quickly get yourself an axe and get wood to upgrade the towers so you don't leak early. Since this is absolutely mandatory I don't get why there's no way to skip it or just start with resources. Yeah gathering during and between waves is a unique idea on paper, but it's more tedious than anything in practice. It does get better when you get NPCs to harvest for you, but it still sucks.




Here is what the game honestly needs to be good:

Less survival, more TD! The balance between survival and TD is horrendous in this. I believe 100% of other TD games I've played over the last 20 years all gave you time to strategize, but this does not. It's just farming farming farming against the clock. It's extremely tedious and boring.

MAKE TOWER STATS ACCURATE! Several towers have stats that are lying or missing. A great example is the mortal tower that says it has a 2 second cooldown, but in reality the cooldown is 7 seconds! That's 350% slower than what is listed!

Make workers persistent. Just let the player build the houses for workers at the start wherever they want them WITH the resource nodes attached.

I'd prefer if armor and weapons were persistent so once you've earned them you've got them, but the current system would work if the above was implemented.

Make the stuff you have to craft at the start free to craft! Wtf is the point in wasting your players' time by forcing them to spam E all over the ground for several minutes before they start each match?",1,0
"Completely unbalanced mindless broken chaos. Its like playing a game with cheats enabled.

You get stats upgrade from +200% to +3500% which makes everything fill the screen with size and cover entire map instant killing everything with instant coldown making everything fire like a gatling gun. I could not see any final bosses I killed because of my oversized puppies filling the screen. To say the game is very easy is an understatement. You will beat every level first try with no effort because of these crazy stat upgrades. I don't know why developer did not decide to place normal +10, 20, 30% upgrade instead of +1000%. No sense of progression. 

For the price of a cup of coffe (2€) you get a mindless chaos on screen if you like just to experiment and have fun. I hope developer decreases stat upgrades to something normal so you can actually see what you kill.",0,1

"Visually this game is fine and reminds me a lot of My Time at Portia. Not my style, but made pretty well. Music is nice, sets the atmosphere.

But gameplay... 
The first thing I noticed was how slow it is. You are forced to carry a big bagpack which slows you down a lot. Then I noticed bugs. First are in the menu - when you move mouse around weird text bubbles appear. Then I died a few times by getting inside rocks or because of my character getting stuck midair. The camera will change randomly, which can make you die if you are walking and suddenly your character turns to walk into water.

The story also didn't get me enough to push through all unplesantries. It was boring.

I honestly only played a little past the tutorial/title screen. Treat it as neutral review and keep in mind cons before deciding to play.",0,1

"self-medicating undiagnosed anxiety issues/ADHD starter pack

The amount of mismatched resolution, 30 fps cutscene jank in this decade old clump of PS2 era good and evil will make you feel like you're playing Counter-Strike Online or a mysterious mod pack for Warband off an obscure Russian forum. Stiff animations that'd feel dated in 2009. Nearly no explanation for major in-game mechanics. Instant failure states for not babysitting the right NPC 10+ minutes into a mission. Absolutely no indication what saddles or mystic weapons are or how to get them. Characters and missions locked behind picking a specific character the game doesn't tell you about. Hilarious pop-in with more than 5 NPCs on-screen. Horse that has to be kept track of, takes time to reach you, and much like the old USB flip-around dance, will take 2 full camera pan arounds before it jump scares you (still better than Breath of the Wild). Annoying redundant menus that take three times the amount of button presses stuff takes in WO4.

The story is the dumbest excuse to fanboy over slightly idealized historical figures kinda just showing up and plowing through almost every dumb anime trope in existence, but it's absolutely critical for the events of this tale that you go beat up 1,500 dudes and take turns taking over the same castle 20 times in the span of ten hours as the same character that's trying to stop you from doing it (what?). Oda Nobunaga is still recovering from his botched botox procedure leaving his face stiff and half-deliriously starts every sentence with some variation of ""heh"", but still takes time to tell Ranmaru he feels content with him because the absolute giga cutie accepts him for who he is - the lovably bloodthirsty mass murdering warlord that finds joy in life that he is.

Ethics of dating a warlord aside, it's pretty cute. Except somewhere in the background Ryu Hayabusa is having a conversation with Achilles (whose only purpose in the story is to remind you that Koei actually made a Musou title set in ancient Greece) about how they need to go back in time to stop Ding Feng from planting his fat boy cakes on someone's pet parrot and ruffling its feathers so that in a later timeline he doesn't leave his castle to try and get some parrot comfort food for his sister (who is a sociopathic child) and gets cut down by a woman in a ridiculous BDSM outfit. A girl is looking for her boyfriend and somehow this immediately spirals into a full siege of 6 castles, murdering and maiming over a thousand people, and offending 4 or 5 allied men into hostility because they're indirectly being called old and ugly (one of them is the boyfriend's dad).

I may have made up at least one of those scenarios but the point stands: at no point does this abomination give a fuck that it plays and sometimes looks like a PS2 title and has a story that's a parody of itself. It goes so far out of its way not to give a shit about anything that it includes a fighting game AND a card game in case the thing you bought the game for just wasn't enough. But it doesn't have to. There's enough characters, tunes and dudes to beat up that it can afford to be a janky turd in many aspects and still be good. Really good. Because it's really fun and it understands that beating up 2000 dudes is fun, so it has 130+ different ways for you to do just that across approximately 20 billion missions. And, unlike WO4, it doesn't have a magic super-moveset that makes your character almost obsolete or 0 costumes for most of the cast or over 100 dollars' worth of Koei DLC because it's all bundled in.

Pros:
Very fun
Ranmaru Mori
Decent music

Cons:
Graphics
Performance
Menus
Story
QoL
Balance
Onboarding
Da Ji
DW9 still exists and was probably the reason WO4 wasn't as good

Verdict:
Worth every cent tenfold. The Dark Souls of hack and slash, with guns. Get it and have a tit of a time remembering why videogames exist and why people played them in the pre-eSports dark ages.",0,1

"I had troubles with first 2 launchings of this game on my PC: I couldn't proceed further than clouds in main menu, though I heard the game sounds.  At its 1st launch the game has started to install some Microsoft program for it without my permission, I think it's weird... And a bit inappropriate.  

But ok, then I played like 2-3 times. The game seems to have quite nice graphics. 
It's sokoban type of games [in ancient Egypt/Greece setting]. 
Controls [so far] are just WSAD to go/push the crates in front of you, and ""Space"" to interact with some objects [hit crates or ballistae]. 

I was a little uncomfortable without the ability to rotate the screen, because it is not always clear where the passage is in the wall [when I could see the level from only one angle].

I played something like 10 levels, and each level was dedicated 1 new in-game feature. So, the game has good tutorial, with no rush. Loading screens before each levels have detailed description to each new in-game objects in that levels. First puzzles were easy, of course. But still quite good.
The ""campaign"" is not linear - sometimes you can choose from 4 different levels where you want to proceed.

Game description says that the levels have ""replayable"" value, but I don't think so:  I wouldn't beat these same puzzles in second time.

My FPS was only 9-10 in this game, which is terrible: each move was like the ""slow-mo""...

Futhermore, when I wanted to play today I got black screen... I tried to re-launch the game 2-3 times, it was poinless [black screen and game was not responding to me], so I'll just delete this game now...  It's too unpolished in my opinion.  ""Free"" is the max fair price for it...",1,0

"04OCT23 Review

This DLC seems to be the 'success' that PGI has been needing for a while. That being said, I still recommend you buy this on sale as PGI still only released a slim-budget product. All real effort went into the 15x Mission Campaign.

The specific items:
Campaign - This is one of the better campaigns I have experienced.  The starting 'Mechs are a great mix, weapon and 'Mech market availability is good, starting inventory is well-established, starting money makes you have agency, but not able to fund a whole new line-up. Missions are decently laid out and engaging. Story/Lore is a great peek at ComStar feeding the Kuritans against the FedCom Alliance with more entwined story pieces. This is a particular win for the Lore-Junkie-'Mech-Jockeys. Somehow, this is the best part.

Battlemechs: 5x Longbow, 6x OTOMO Variants of other Chassis.

Longbow - A Great Back-Line Missile Support 'Mech. All 5x variants are materially the same. Some will just have more Laser slots. Other than that, big hit box 'arms' to make sure your missile launchers are hit. This is extremely lazy and could have been augmented with another 'Mech release. I like me a Missile-boat, but come on.

Otomo - Essentially Kuritan Royal Guard Variants with all the awesome LosTech upgrades you could want. In Vanilla MW5:Mercs, that means you just have a standard weapon load with max-ish armor, a bunch of Heatsinks (doubles mainly) and Ammo slotted. I consider these variants essential demi-hero-'Mechs, which point for point, probably could out perform their Hero-Variant counter-parts. No doubt, Modders will vary this up more with internals, engine sizes, and other sweet gear to make these variants be more descriptive and enjoyable to customize.

Free Update - Instant Action fight arena with friends and teams. This could be better completed by redoing MW4 Solaris Arena, making it a mode with George Ledoux as Duncan Fisher narrating arena events. Ultimately, not a 'Free Update', more like, ""We added a feature you probably did not know about"".

Again, in summary: Buy on Sale; Campaign - Good 'nuff; Longbow - Lazy Yawn; Otomo - Hero-contenders; Free Update - Where?",1,0
"Gameplay loop is painfully boring and repetitive.... however, I'm on a quest to see how many eggs I'm able to purchase. I'm in the 100s as of now... day 14 and it's been nothing but fried eggs for the apartment squatter... Uncle Xiao is total DILF and I wish we could take him to pound town... 

this game would benefit by being more reactive to the choices the player makes. LIKE: How about Uncle Xiao asking why i""m constantly buying eggs? Or the lady friend asking why I exclusively feed her fried eggs even after I promise to make her an Asian meal? How about an outfit change here and there? I imagine all the fried eggs I'm forcing this E-Girl mooch to eat are producing some pretty noxious and leaky diarrhea - I get that egg induced diarrhea isn't sexy HOWEVER, IT'S REAL. AND W'ERE HERE FOR REALISM, CAUSE MOST OF US CAN'T AND/OR WON'T EVER EXPERIENCE LIVING WITH A LADY...

"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1,0

"This is a fun obstacle course 3D platformer with potential for competition with perhaps a few other players. You may want to be sure you have friends getting this game with you, as though it advertises as a multiplayer, it appeared to me to require friends on Steam to join your game, and there wasn't any multiplayer lobbies at all. Was not able to personally test the multiplayer feature, so cannot state what that would be like. There also appeared to be just one level, but this was a decent course to play on. Overall perhaps not that impressive, but it is a very affordable game, and not a bad price for the content.
The music really adds to the exciting feel of the game, motivating you to play on to victory - even if by yourself.

Themes:

Family friendly. Technically your 3D stick-figure character can ""die"" by the obstacles or by falling of the edge (expect this to happen often), but is re-spawned at the previous check point, and obviously there's nothing graphic.

Assuming you can get multiplayer happening, parents may wish to monitor communication, as online chat is available.

"This is a reboot of Ghosts of War. The Graphics have improved, by a lot, but other than that... It has less content that its predecessor, the Progress trees which just buffed the Stats of your weapon (Rof, damage...) by a little, were replaced by Upgrades to sights, ammo and magazine. You get Red dot sights (eww), magical invisible mag extensions and Ammo types to improve the ammo performance. GoW had basic load outs for Axis and Allies, the first starting with a german Officer and a MP 40, the later with a Red Army Soldier and a PPsh-41. And a Pistole and a Knife each, cant remember which. In this game, both side's standard Loadouts are a MG 13, a Revolver and a german Knife. The controls are a little clunky, but overall good. Cant Sneak and Jump arent placed on Ctrl and Space Bar by default, option to change controls not existing (?). The Gameplay is... Repetetive. At least the Balance is working. But almost all guns have inaccurate Magazine Sizes and RoF. PPsh-41 with only 400 Rounds per Minute. MG-42 with a 50rnd Drum that contains 100 rounds, a RoF of 950rpm, the muzzle also looks a bit off. In the end, the quality issues could be fixed. But there's one thing that cant be fixed.

I really like  Pow! 2.  However I have run  into the same problem I had with Pow.  On certain levels it is impossible to activate the timers because they are  too high up on the right side  and hidden by the over all large count down timer.  As a result I am not able to complete the level and move on.  It would be really good if this could be fixed,0,1

"Played on a i7-8700, 16GB RAM, GTX1070Ti with a Valve Index (90Hz refresh rate, Motion Smoothing on). Observations are as follow:

- For VR users, the controls would benefit from being able to do one of the following: (i) Have traditional flight controls as an option (e.g. pitch, strafe, roll, thrust assigned to the joysticks).  The ability to do rolls alongside pitch/strafe while in these worlds would enhance the immersiveness of being withIN this world, whereas right now I feel I am moving strictly along a x-y plane with 'thrust' simulating the z-axis. (ii) Allow an option for where head movements are independent of the motion controllers.  Being able to look around, while controlling my direction/orientation with the controllers gives myself a better feel of immersion.
I guess when it comes to flying around, either I'm doing it inside of a cockpit, or I should be doing doing Superman-style (Literally have your hands out in front of you, and the movement of your arms controls like a plane (except for speed).

- The 3D effects in VR feel more like overlays on top of one another, more than eveything feeling as part of the same world.  If anybody has tried playing a 2D first-person game game with VorpX (a 3-D infuser type program used to simulate VR within your headset, to varying degrees of success), you'll know better of what I am trying to relate.

The 3D effects in VR are by no means horrible, but as other reviewers have mentioned, it feels a bit 'off' .

- The 'black-n-white-n-grey' levels have more artificating going on in the level compared to the color levels.  As a result, the non-color levels often have varying degrees of 'shimmering' going on wehn viewing objects at  a distance, often to the point where it is distracting and makes me think of a Playstation 1 game in extreme cases.  Conversely, getting closer to objects just about always enhances their detail.
The color levels have their share of artificating, but the 'blending' of colors offers a more subdued contrast, and eliminates a fair portion of any shimmering that might be there.

- The most amazing part of this experience is the discovery of 'worlds within worlds' when flying through the levels.  Just flying along on top of the 'Death Star' level was initially disappointing, but go underneath the surface, and dive deeper into the structures themselves, and I have discovered far more intersting levels to explore.

- The music is relaxing, but a mix-up of themes would be welcome.  I'm not saying the 'black-n-white-n-grey' need Star Wars music, but something more 'operatic' might enhance the immersiveness for myself.

This expereince is possibly the best V'Ger simulator I could hope for (refer to Star Trek: The Motion Picture).",0,1

Game is buggy crashes from time to time for no reason. Sex scenes are just a hand job and missionary where you cant see anything. Game plays a lot like the old final fantasy. Game play is easy and basic. Hopefully the developer finishes the job and fixes the game.,1,0
"This is about as Meh as a positive review can get, but it's got some nice scenes so worth a play if you can get it 80% off or better.
Animations gone.  Guess they just figured they would not get better so removed them entirely.  Not a huge loss but still a bit disappointing.
Narration is still annoying but you get used to it.  At least there is sexy sounds in the lewd scenes.
Game is super short, played through all variations in about an hour.  
Midnight Stories 3, 4, and 5 should really all be the same game, they even share save files, so it seems they were at some point.  Separated they are just not worth the money.
Hard to really recommend, as there are just lots of better AVNs out there, but if narrated sex scenes is your thing, you might enjoy it.",0,1
"Dragon Dawn I'm okay with. It's $10 and I think it was that price already at its release.

For this, I just don't know.

Reaver culture is the main selling point, and I think it's pretty reasonable well done for what it is. 4 tomes is also 2 more tomes than came with Dragon Dawn.

Avian form in itself is meaningless to me... I guess it's cool for role-playing, but it's a cosmetic (though new traits are added as well, traits aren't directly linked to the forms in AoW4 anymore).

And some of the rest is kind of assorted odds and ends... bear mounts, 2 story maps.

This doesn't feel like a much bigger DLC than Dragon Dawn, in some ways. That might be because Dragon Dawn already sort of felt like it was a larger DLC... even though it didn't add a new culture, the Dragon hero/leader had its own sort of unique system to it. Maybe it's that Dragon Dawn was really good... maybe that's why this feels a bit weaker?

But I have to say, this is not something that for $20 feels like a much bigger DLC than Dragon Dawn.

"This game is not fun to play, I applaud the developers for making an actually quality game, there is no broken UI or something that makes it unplayable. It even has control remapping, which is better than most AAA games! However, a puzzle game is only as good as its puzzles, and this game is just not it. If you expect any mechanic to be explained to you, then good luck. Most puzzles have you wondering what you are even trying to do only for you to solve it by accident. The first ""puzzle"" you play is a memory game similar to a Simon Says but with more buttons, however, if you mess up on the last one like I did, the game doesn't reset you to the start to try again like it should, no, it just rearranges the order. On the max difficulty. Good luck trying to memorize a sequence you've never seen before while it flashes 7 different buttons. Two puzzles I had a hard time with were the ""Watch your step!"" puzzle and the ""Chosen One"" puzzle. The former puzzle, as you can guess, I solve on accident after 20 minutes of trying to piece together ""maybe the order or the colors on the flipped hue axis or maybe it has something to do with the colors that don't show up on the first row or-"" It was instead just only step on the colors that weren't glowing, the problem being the room is well lit so it makes it hard to tell what is glowing or not, and the maze switches to a new layout every time you die. The latter puzzle is coincidentally the last puzzle in the game, where you put 5 colors in the right order. This took me over an hour of randomly guessing, going through each possible combination and throwing pieces of scratch paper to find the solution. The way you are supposed to find the solution is the 5 pillars in front of you that increase in height, allowing you to parkour to the final door. The last pillar however is hidden until you beat the puzzle, and the order has nothing to do with their hue, the number of sides on the shape, the height of the pillar, or the height of the actual buttons themselves. All of those are red herrings, and I still don't know why they made all the buttons different heights, but you are supposed to put in the visual order that they appear in while viewing them from the pedestal where the puzzle is. And guess on the green one's order because it's hidden until the puzzle that it's required for is solved; like a key in its own lockbox. What would have made it better is if there was different songs for each puzzles, but there is only really 2 main songs you hear play, and loop, until you guess the right combination. It got to the point where I had to mute the music because how often it looped. Pair this with janky cut-scene animations and illexistant story and you get a kind of meh experience. I doubt this game will appear on anyone's must play list, or it will get extraordinarily popular, but the game never did anything wrong or outright unplayable. It's just that the puzzles suck.",0,1

"Pros:
- It's Level Up system.

I find Level Up module a more interesting than simple DnD 5e due to classes having more possibilities/abilities ([strike]instead of simple bonk fighter, *cough-cough*[/strike]). So if I had to choose between a simple DnD 5e and Level Up I'd choose of course the Level Up.

Cons:
- It's not actually the Level Up!
- No Expertise/Speciality System (Really?)
- No Character Wizard (Seriously?)
- No Section for Combat Manuevers (Oh come on!)

I mean, who makes a module, without its core mechanic - expertise system? No expertise dices, no indication of skill speciality existing (even in video explaining this module, poor dude had to actually create himself a speciality for his skill, and still it was just a plain copy of the skill itself with no differences). You just want me to remember that I've actually a speciality, and then roll a d20, then only roll additional dice instead of combining then in one roll, don't you?

And Level Up is more loaded with Character creation (due to having many things like Destiny, Maneuvers, Speciality, etc). A cool system of creating a character with step-by-step would be actually useful, but no... you just expect the player to read the book like 5 times to remember that they actually need also to choose 2 starting speciality?

And Combat Maneuvers... Look how they massacred my boy... Combat Maneuvers were put into the Feat section. With no filtering by tradition or level. Wasted. (Spells by the way has too plain interface of selection. But I guess it Fantasy Grounds itself by fault.)

So, yeah. By it's current state I'd say I just wasted my money on this module for nothing. I hope it will be improved for better in future. Even VTT has better functionality/modules for Level Up, although it has flaws too.",1,0

"I have mixed feelings about the game. I have been with this game for years now and there are a few bugs that are consistent. Almost no team breaks out when they are on the penalty kill, they try and get control and they dump it out of the zone. Power play is similar. The attacking team does not set up and try and work the play around in the zone....everything is an attempted breakaway. Speaking of breakaways, there should be a higher percentage of goals scored on breakaways. Right now they are unsuccessful like 90 percent of the time. One team ALWAYS has an inordinately large amount of shots on goal....like 50-55. 30-35 shots on goal is alot. Teams on the breakout that are threatening the net don't pass it back and forth ten times. Lastly, the graphics. How can you have such a wonderfully well detailed baseball game with 3D graphics and panoramic views and not be able to somehow translate it over to making simple movements like skating and shooting and a goalie sliding around his crease.

"Overall a short boring walking simulator, barely any horror in the game at all. Got stuck at a point where I had to shoot on a solid door that apparently was one way-glass with a really small ""fragile"" text in the bottom of it. Before that I walked back and forth trying to figure out if it was some kind of puzzle element with the 2 switches in the game which you could turn on and off, the only thing that did was confuse me making me believe one had to be turned on and the other off to progress.

When I played the game I was forced to join the discord and type a stupid command to get a code if i wanted to progress in the game. This has apparently been fixed now in a recent patch which is a good thing.
There is nothing chasing you 97% of the game, the only ""chase"" sequence is in the end in a maze which lasts about 1 minute.
I would say the graphics, sound and lighting are the only good things with this game and the fact that it is free. 
The developers have another game upcoming based on this so I would like to assume this is a kind of demo of the upcoming game but if that is the case I think it should be stated on the store page which gives you less expectations of an actual game.",1,0
"For starters, there is one negative review that is unfairly bringing the rest of the rating down. The review claims that the games sucks because it could have been better if was remastered. I agree it would have been better but giving this a thumbs down based on what it COULD be is just wrong. If you want to see a remaster of this game, giving it a thumbs down and encouraging people not to buy this version is pretty dumb. If you like this game, go thumbs up some of the positive ratings.

TRANSFER CHARACTERS FROM DARK SUNS SHATTERED LANDS TO WAKE OF THE RAVAGER!!! First, you need to beat Shattered Lands, then when it drops you back into the game do any remaining side quests you want to and then save it. For steam you have to edit the game.conf in the Dark Sun 2 folder. Take the save game file from the original game, create a folder in the Dark Suns 2 Dosbox game folder where the RAVAGER folder is and name the new folder DSUN. At this point the only two folders should be RAVAGER and DSUN. this is the folder that Dosbox uses for C:\. Place the save game file from Dark Sun Shattered lands into the DSUN folder you just created. Now find the game.conf in the Dark Suns 2 folder  and edit it with notepad. Change where it says RAVAGE.BAT to CHARTRAN.EXE and save. Run the game like normal, it should show up with a screen that says something like C:\dsun C:\Ravager press enter to transfer. Press enter, you'll see it throw the character names up there and its done. Change the line in game.conf from CHARTRAN.EXE back to RAVAGE.BAT save and they should show up when you go to character creation, right click and chose add. You'll get the vast majority of your items when you start a game in ravager. All xp past lvl 9 will be added and after the first combat event you'll level up to where you XP is. For example my mage leveled from 9 to 12 immediately because even though the level cap in the first game was 9 I had the XP to get to lvl 12. Some of the armor pieces and various books and quest items turned into 1 ceramic piece and one belt turned into a leather body armor. I wish I new about this feature back in the 90's I probably would have given this game more a chance.
 
Dosbox cycles matter. If your magic battles are going slow (as mine were) then use CTRL + F12 to increase cycles (12,000 + seemed to work for me) and CTRL + F11 to decrease cycles.

The game is great and holds up well I think. I love the different races and classes to choose from. The combat is excellent and starting you off in the arena as a tutorial of sorts is brilliant. When you get out into the desert and the world opens up its just fantastic to explore. I love the setting and a lot of the stories that you encounter are really good. The game is definitely set up for you to be the ""Good guy saviour of the wastes type of guy but there are plenty of evil ways to finish the quests also.""

Personal Favorite Team. I like running the thief as the main character so that all the options they have will readily appear. I almost didn't go with a thief at all but as my primary character I seem to be getting better random loot. Went with Ranger instead of Fighter or Gladiator because of the no penalties to duel wielding. Melee combat is extremely powerful and the mutliclass system doesn't seem to have many limitations. It's kind of like going into combat with 4 rangers, 3 clerics, 2 preservers and 1 thief. 

Half Elf - Ranger / Preserver / Thief
Thri-Kreen - Cleric / Ranger / Psionic
Half-Giant - Ranger / Cleric
Elf - Preserver / Cleric / Ranger

The game is clunky and if you specialize (meaning you only pick one class) then you might find yourself having a hard time with the final battle and the next game if you decide to try that option. Or at least that's what happened to me. Couldn't figure out what was going on and saw that most people use multiclasses online. Having tried multiclasses out I find that it's definitely the way to go.

I remember as a kid playing the game as 4 half giants with different classes. I might try that again on my next playthrough. I also didin't realize that there was a huge underground temple that connected a lot of the maps together until literally the end of the game so something to look forward to next time. Also, having played through it a few times now I really enjoy the ""random encounters"" you come across. Not sure how many there are exactly, and there's one with a druid where you collect butterflys that I haven't found yet. Not sure if you need to be a specific class ... any help is welcome.",0,1

Pros:

-No endless mode, or any other real reason to continue playing.
-Felt like a flash game that I paid $7 for. Not mad about it, but I could've bought myself a latte and played something online.
-I didnt experiment a whole lot, but there seemed to only be a couple viable build methods with no incentive to try anything new.

"Love the graphics and overall idea of the game. However, I went into the game expecting a cute relaxing game where I will sell potions and meet the npc's instead I got stressed out

- Game is INSANELY HARD specially the first 10 days ( in which the 10th day is a competition you need to win, if you lose it's game over and you need to restart the whole game again which can take HOURS ). First 10 days should've been the tutorial part.
- Lots of game breaking bugs, one is I can't use the guild since the game is opening an old save file that I'm trying to delete but I don't know how and now I'm locked out of the guild.
- Lots of RNG which sucks if you're already stressing about the first 10 days and about the competition
- Has love interests however you won't even have time to socialize, game requires you to grind and plan early on

On a positive note,

The npc's are interesting! they do have lots of personalities. The graphics of the game is beautiful and it's really pretty! Might need a few tweaks and changing of difficulty levels would be nice.

It's decent. A bit bland, but functional. Performs well, looks really nice, sounds pretty good. There is very little depth or variety to the gameplay though, most of it consists of strafing around enemies and using abilities when the cooldowns are done. There's not a whole lot of items to get, and the upgrade options are not very interesting.

I do understand it's a sort of demo, and I am just reviewing it as it is. I'm still looking forward to the full game's release.

Also, devs, please, the sprint button needs to go. There is literally no reason to not sprint when you're out of combat. It should automatically speed you up when you stop attacking.

- Frequent issues with translation quality, proofreading, typos and sentence construction. The localization to ENG from RUS is of subpar quality, at best.

- Dubious logic and narrative fallacies in multiple chapters, especially in the ‘past’ timeline, in which you’ll frequently fail and die for hilariously forced, implausible reasons.

- Most characters feel generic or are indeed interesting at first, but then fail to evolve and keep interest up with their persona as the adventure continues.

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]

With Good Intentions spans across two separate timelines. The present one is set in a 1800s-esque environment that sees captain Paul Lange lead his imperial scouts, alongside numerous allies through the countryside, after a major rebellion toppled the government and put the military in disarray. In the past one, you’ll instead play as Rayon Von Eigo, master of his own knightly order and charged with commanding the Shemergard fortress, in place to repel enemy invasions.

Most of the story, in both timelines, takes place in this massive fortress-monastery and its environs. There’s a stark contrast between the past and present versions of the place, with the former being well-maintained and stocked, while the one visited by Lange in the future is not only dilapidated, but seemingly haunted by dark forces as well. What once was a mighty fortress now lies in ruins, becoming a last ditch attempt to shelter a routing army.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2891765465

The atmosphere is quite excellent, even if the lack of music and sound effects in most ordinary scenes takes away some of the pathos. The different art styles applied to respectively talks, action scenes and narration panels come together nicely and offer some aesthetic variation that is indeed, welcome. With Good Intentions saves most of its soundtrack and SFX for the most important scenes - with a probably limited budget, this is a wise choice indeed.

Main and side characters are of inconsistent make: some quirky and intriguing individuals may arise from time to time, however it’s also true some of the (supposedly) centerpieces of the adventure just prove bland and one-sided (such as Lange’s sidekick sergeant, to name one). There’s a lack of insight in most characters’ personal life or ideas, as there simply won’t be the chance to have any dialogue with them that isn’t related to the main story’s progress. This becomes especially true and evident in later chapters and will be a hindrance if you’re trying to understand anything beyond the characters’ role in the fortress environment. There’s never any further elaboration on the world or lore either, making the monastery seem like a self-contained bubble (and in some ways, it actually is) where no topics except the daily misadventures ever exist. Sure, you’ll hear some rumors and trivia but that’s it.

With Good Intentions is made unique by its handling of death - because yes, in this visual novel you can actually die - as Von Eigo at least. Basically, every time you take a wrong ‘route’, your demise will be inevitable, be it at the hand of an enemy or more mysterious forces. The knowledge acquired from dialogues and actions will however be kept for the next instance of what essentially is a time loop, with Rayon being able to use it to change things to his favor. Each ‘past’ sequence is ultimately a combination puzzle where you die until you find the right set of actions that give a (single) good ending, thus finishing the chapter. In the present, conversely, you won’t be able to die, no matter how badly you may seem to screw up.

On paper this system would be intriguing, but it’s terribly implemented for the most part. Technical shenanigans aside (and those are already enough because let’s be honest, it’s a visual novel, not Space Engineers) there is a clear lack of proofreading and mediocre translation quality; expect weird syntax and wording as common issues. On top of that, the absence of manual saving and the inability to skip to the next choice immediately, when repeating an already-seen dialogue, make the experience tedious because the non-adjustable text speed is too low (even with speed-up enabled). This leads to an enormous amount of wasted time and filler that have no place in any decent visual novel.

Another huge flaw is found in the numerous non-sequiturs (in layman terms: nonsense) related to the causes of death, or to the available choices in some dialogues. On numerous occasions you’ll find poor Rayon dying for arbitrary reasons that at times are not even explained properly, or him suddenly unable to use critical information in a logical way, simply because that choice wasn’t accounted for. It leaves a bitter, disappointing taste to see how much potential was wasted due to mediocre writing and dubious logic.

"I want to start out by saying initially I really enjoyed the game, however it suffers from forced time elements and feels similar to a freemium game.

The Good:
- A lot more content and involved mechanics than most other Kairosoft games
- Great graphics
- Lots of options around recruiting members and building your ship
- Fun pirate theme

The Bad:
- Stamina is used for quests and is time based, so you’ll either have to leave the game and come back or use medals to refill it
- Medals are needed to advance and are slow to obtain. While you can buy them with gold it is limited and resets only after several hours
- Feels like a mobile game meant to be played in chunks throughout the day
- Due to the design it comes across as a freemium game with only small changes
- Can be extremely grindy, particularly later on (which is made worse by the time aspect)
- The best way to get good recruits is the dice game so feels pointless to level up and change jobs with any other characters as they’ll never be as good
- Menus are fairly clunky and not everything is explained

Overall it was an extremely promising game that fell flat. If you’re alright with short but frequent play sessions and a need to grind then you’ll probably like it.",1,0

I did the tutorial with a little lag it was fine. But once I entered level 1 my game was so slow, impossible to play at all I had to stop or I would have to do the whole game looking at walls to reduce the lag. I hope the game will be optimized because I really wanted to play this game fully.",0,1

"I only played the 0 part of this series besides this one and, even though it is very weird to say in this context, the pt.13 is much worse than pt.0. Even though the gameplay remains identical (besides the new ""flashlight"" gimmick which btw was a complete miss imo) the charm of the first game is gone here. 
I actually quite enjoyed the pt.0, the Halloween theme looked pretty so wanted to try this one. But what made the first game so charming and not aggravating was it's level ""structure"" - the levels were arranged in such way that complicated levels followed the easier ones and it made the game feel satisfying and completable. This part is just a bunch of really hard levels smooshed together (once again, the ""flashlight"" mechanic doesn't make it any more fun). 
You don't feel like you're having a good time anymore, you feel like ""I wish I could complete this asap and be done with it"" which honestly sucks comparing this to the bliss I've felt playing pt.0.
Here I had to use hints about 20 percent of the game, though I managed to complete the pt.0 with about 10 hints in total, probably less.

"Snips & Snails is an otome game centered around a college student (nameable by the player, default Lacy) in a contemporary/urban fantasy world where supernatural beings—known as ""Arcane"" or ""Arcs""—have recently become officially known to humans and now freely intermingle after a long period of secrecy. Most of that background doesn't affect the MC much, though, with the story largely centered around her interactions with the Alatars, a family of Arcs whose sons (mage Sullivan, vampire Quinn, and incubus Yuuto) all happen to attend the same college she does. (There's also a fourth LI, Eryck, the ghost who ""haunts"" the Alatar residence.) Major side characters include the MC's dad and her best friend Arabella, the latter of whom also grows closer to one of the boys.

The story is fairly straightforward romance, with the MC getting closer to the guy of your choice, plus a subplot involving mysterious dreams that the MC starts having. Each route has a good ending and a neutral/bad ending, as well an unlockable epilogue and bonus story. There are also optional text-only sex scenes (no explicit images, text roughly as explicit as the average print romance novel).

So, let's start off with the good things:

- The art is nice, especially the CG art.

- There are interesting things about the setting and worldbuilding. Even though generally Snips & Snails trends much more heavily towards slice of life than fantasy, for the most part I don't really feel like the fantasy elements have been wasted (which tends to be an issue with fantasy slice of life).

- The sex scenes are optional, with no game penalty for choosing not to read through them.

- There are a couple other not-story-affecting choices that I appreciated having (whether or not MC is a virgin, whether or not she drinks alcohol) just for story flavor purposes.

- [spoiler]Thanks for making the cute vampire bi, even if it only comes up at the end of a route that's not his, and his boyfriend's identity kind of makes the plot of a third route fall apart if you think about it[/spoiler]

Unfortunately...

- The writing just isn't very good. It reads like someone's first attempt at writing a story—and if it were just that it would be a commendable attempt. But this is a commercial game; you have to pay money to play it.

- The script does not appear to have been edited or proofread in any way; besides the fact that there's nobody listed as an editor or proofreader in the credits, there are frequent typos and places where characters say things that sound extremely unnatural or awkward (where it doesn't make sense for them to seem unnatural/awkward). When the writing is the primary focus of the game, it [b]needs to be treated as such[/b], not as an afterthought like this feels.

- The sex scenes in particular are extremely awkward—not just in writing, but also in staging. Because there are no CGs there, instead you get to see the LI's half-naked sprite do absolutely nothing through the whole scene (where the text makes it clear that he's very much not doing absolutely nothing). A black screen as the background would genuinely be preferable; just having the bedroom background with no sprites would work too.

- The game itself feels stiff. Sprites rarely move when it seems like they should, keeping the same expression for long periods of time. There are conversations that go on and on with none of the characters on screen moving in any way. I'm not asking for the developer to go so far as to include animations or Live2D, those absolutely aren't necessary for a good VN, but just having the sprites regularly change expression and/or move across the screen can do a lot for engagement.

- The game's hero banner spoils every CG in the game (and by extension a major plot point). This is a relative nitpick, but if you're someone who doesn't like having CGs spoiled, it might be an annoyance.

In all, while there is some potential here, ultimately Snips & Snails falls flat in its most important area, and thus I can't recommend it. While the visual issues are inconsequential enough that I could overlook them in a better-written game, the script would need a massive overhaul or total rewrite in order to get to a level that I could recommend spending money on it. With all that said, there [i]is[/i] enough potential here that, with practice and editing, I could definitely see this developer release a quality VN in the future!

"It's free so it's an easy recommend. You don't even have to register with any 3rd party site to play (although it keeps track of your scores if you do). You can play against AI, but the AI is pretty dumb and you can just be offsides the entire match and your AI teammates will always try to pass you the ball, no matter where you are. So basically, you have to be offsides for easy goals. I don't recommend this game for single player.

However, multiplayer is obviously where this is at. There seems to be a fair number of people in MP. It may be fun, but after trying out the single player modes (there's a few available), I was dead tired from the locomotion. It's basically the same movement from Gorilla Tag, if you're not aware, it's sort of like arm swing locomotion except you kick yourself off the ground by your hands hitting the ground. 

So it involves a lot of physical exertion to run up and down the pitch (soccer field for us Americans). Honestly, I don't know how anyone can play a full match having to use this locomotion method. I definitely think this game is made for young kids to just exhaust themselves. This game is perfect for the VR mom or dad who wants their little one to go to bed after 30 minutes of playing this. 

Rate 11/10 for VR mom and dads who are looking for ways to get their bratty kids to sleep. 5/10 for everyone else.",0,1

"Pros:
-New weapons feel great to use.
-New feats make going full tin can very fun.

Cons:
-Intro and story isn't as captivating as The Expedition, locations doesn't feel as visually unique when compared to the rest of the game and The Expedition DLC.
-Patrols are absolutely relentless to the point of tedium, you don't have time to loot or heal before you're bombarded with another group of enemies homing into your position.
-Enemies are frustratingly strong, it makes sense for Strongmen and most Transcendent Surmirbarens to have high health + defense and strong melees because they lack range attacks, you can kite the Surmirbarens or use traps and funnel them into a choke point, Strongmen are easily countered with EMPs or by making them infight with crabs. Exosoldiers have both strong ranged attacks (Single-target and AOE) and survivability, making them an absolute pain to deal with in large group. Using an EMP grenade isn't always viable, because the bot will nullify it like it's casting Counter-Nade', meaning you'll almost always have to waste AP on it first before you can throw an EMP grenade. There seems to be very little weakness for the enemies in this DLC.
-Bland, boring gameplay loop. Like some have pointed out, it's like Deep Cavern, but somehow worse.

TL;DR: Shockingly bad when compared to the main game and The Expedition DLC. 4/10",1,0

"This is such a great concept and I really like the base of the game but there is really not much to do. I understand that this is just the beginning of the game so im judging this more off of what it could be and not what it is. The coffee options are very limited and it is so hard to get just one type of people to like a drink let alone multiple. I think it would be nice if they added more options that appealed to more people to make the game a little easier to play/. I also think it would be awesome if they added cold coffees and milkshakes or something as they already had ice cream but it was hard to use. Everything just needs to be expanded a bit and im really hoping they do that in the completed version. Also I would really love to have themed cafes, for example you have hipsters in the game. I want to make a coffee shop just for hipsters or just for business. ++++

























































































































































































































































































































































































































I will start with saying that this game is really fun and I would recommend if building and simulation games are your thing. It has a great base and I enjoyed playing the game even in the early stages. That being said I think alot of work needs to be done in expanding all the options as trying to make coffees that people like is so hard. I was making awful combinations of so much stuff just for hipsters to be the only ones to like it. I think if they added more options and more categories and made it a little easier to apeal to people then it would be so much more fun. I also think it would be really awesome is there were themed coffee shops like just for hipsters or family based.

"First off, don't be fooled by the review time. I accidentally left it on for a while. Beware that risk if you want to try it within that 2-hour time limit; the launcher is its own separate program, and can sneakily sit around eating up that precious refund time limit if you're not careful.

So anyway, I came here first for smut, so that's what I'll be reviewing it on, mostly. The card game can get fun, but not without a lot of grinding, especially if you're trying it on high difficulty.

The pros are that the models are detailed, the womens' designs are gorgeous and sexy, the tweened sway of each model is genuinely sexy, and the sex scene buildup feels tense. Plus, they actually give interesting, even likable personalities to most of the girls in this. Not to mention the steamy, attractive bonus art that you can unlock with the puzzle in each area, which mostly shows some saucy yuri action.

Too bad, then, that they don't seem to appreciate their own girls as much as we'd like to. Once again- I'm beginning to think as the bog-standard for any anime-themed VN or dating sim, especially AO-rated ones- the protagonist is an asshole who doesn't seem to care much about how whoever he's with feels. I get the feeling this guy would clack drinks with the shitstain from Open at Nine if they met.

__

Worse, the game normalizes rape. Two succubus sisters are confirmed to have actively raped Dorothea, *chronically*, and Dorothea has had to live with that. Now, that in itself would be survivable- it could have been a deep dive into the trauma of a sexual assault victim and the healing process- but no, since this comes from the gilded cesspit that is anime/weaboo culture, it's just mentioned once or twice in game, and then we're not even supposed to care anymore.

I gave the artbook a try, and though it was underwhelming and I eventually called in a refund, credit where it's due: It confirms that this is exactly what happened.

But that's not even the worst part. The rape is actually presented as this ""sexy"" thing, a scene of Dorothea being raped by the succubus sisters being the first unlockable puzzle picture in the game. Then, we actually *meet* the two succubus sisters- they're a sex scene, for hell's sake - and if the game writers had any since of justice, we could be allowed to kill them and avenge Dorothea's dignity. 

But no. After you get the sex scene with the sisters, their dialogue claims they're just going to follow you around now. And if you get to the endof the game and choose to finish off the Demon Queen - proving, by the way, the protagonist has no qualms killing demons - and you go with Aura, these two lesbian rapists go with you and become- get this- angels. *ANGELS*.

This, for me, is singlehandedly enough that I've finally decided I just can't recommend it. But that's one big hurdle. There are a few other reasons why I wouldn't recommend Aura hearts anyway.

1st, for a game with such alluring designs and swaying animations, the actual sex scenes are underwhelming. Again, the protagonist is a little Nick Fuentes junkie who needs to assert his ""alpha"" status, so he never actually pleasures any of these sexy, likable women he's with, unless you count the one or two characters who give what is definitely not a completely fake smile. Oh, and Heyla. She just role-reverses this little shit and I absolutely love it.

2ndly, except for Aura herself, there is only one - *one*  - animated sex scene with every single woman. And that sucks, because women with designs and personalities like these deserve way more. Many of these women are buxom, but Aura's the only one who gives a titjob. The artist for this game has a knack for drawing beautiful pussies, but the protagonist never gets a real fingering, fisting, or cunnilingus option. These womens' eyes, mouths, heck their whole faces are amazing, but the protagonist isn't shown actually kissing them on the mouth or neck even *once*.

All those possibilities are wasted with these bland sex scenes. The only two animated sex scenes I can think of that actually strike me as sexy are with the merchant girl and Heyla. Heyla because she actually decides to make it a good time for herself, and the merchant girl because the protagonist is grabbing her tail and it's creatively set inside her shop. And even these sex scene just waste all the wonderful things you could be doing with these women.

And orgasm? Orgasm is *always* the privilege this obnoxious little farmer. If there is even one moment in this game where one of the women actually squirts, it obviously wasn't good enough to remember.

So yeah, the actual main reason for this game, the sex, is a letdown unless you just don't care for much imagination when it comes to sex.
____

Small potatoes at this point, but I'd also like to lend that the voice acting is mostly underwhelming. You've got several mighty warrior women, including Heyla and a lesbian cat lady from more explicitly Japanese animal-people kingdom... giving off these ridiculous screams that sound like they were lifted out of a 1950's B movie.
____

But credit where it's due, that Aura Hearts has so much else going for it that it took me this long to work up the nerve. Make no mistake, there's a lot of good stuff going to waste. The aforementioned character design and sway, the card game that actually eventually gets fun, the detailed map you can travel that makes it seem like a real world that could be its own full open-world experience if they wanted to make it such, and the sense of progression. Leveling up is appealing, and once you actually figure out what the stats each *do*, it's rewarding and satisfying... eventually. And in combat, it's actually a bit rewarding to see the women get more and more naked, and more and more of their beautiful, sexy bodies become exposed, as you whittle their health down - even if it's annoying that the dialogue afterward never once acknowledges that this is what's happening and the cutscene that follows (unless you're just going straight for the sex scene) has them fully reclothed like nothing happened.

And, one of the girls, the merchant, has a different way to get an intimate scene with than all the others, again, based on progression, and I love it.

This is not to mention the chests, secrets, and mini-quests you can find in the overworld, and the small stories and quests you can find in the towns. I personally like the portrayal of a vast open-world experience through the use of menus and textboxes, and it delivers here. To say nothing of that these quests are the few moments in the game where the protagonist actually seems like a good guy, or at least he can be if you have the right stats or make the right choices.

___

The nail in the coffin is that the devs only seem to respond to comments in the discussions in Cyrillic. Us English speakers tend to get ignored, left out of what would otherwise be a saving grace of community interaction. Pretty much every issue I have here could be allayed if the devs had only written back to let me know they read my suggestions and are thinking about it.

I can't deny I'll probably pull this up again eventually, but I wouldn't buy Aura Hearts again if I had the chance to redo it, knowing what I know now.",1,0

"Wciągnęło na wiele godzin i nie chciało wypluć ;) Niemalże każdy poziom jest osobliwy i wymaga uruchomienia innego zestawu szarych komórek, ale rozgrywka nie jest przekombinowana.

"Although I appreciate the concept, the game's performance is lacking. It contains numerous bugs, indicating that it is not yet ready for release. Moreover, there are multiple spelling mistakes, the absence of a visible cash amount, and a lack of challenges or distinctions between levels, except for the different rooms. There are various aspects that need improvement. While I genuinely like the game and its idea, I believe it was released prematurely.",0,1

"Waited well over a year for this game through multiple delays.

Pros
Great Atmosphere, very creepy
Looks/Runs great
Definitely fills a horror genre niche that needs to be filled
Most importantly can be finished in the refund window

Cons
No clear quest marker/objective. 
Clunky combat/mechanics
Doesnt really explain what happens when an enemy grabs you
Got stuck mindlessly trying to go through a cornfield and couldn't trigger the next part of the story leading me to get stuck for long enough that I as outside the refund window",1,0

"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1,0

"this game sucks but the mushrooms are kawaii so im not gonna rate it down or refund it but tbh i wouldn't recommend it unless you wanna use it as a screensaver or something.

some suggestions:
have write ups/summaries/info about all of the mushrooms you can get
different colours for mushrooms
mushroom hats
put more depth into ""Each one has a unique personality."" If they could dance or emote at each other it would make it more rewarding to keep the game on longer and see what the mushrooms would get up to while AFK",0,1

"Early Alpha level game.  I like the idea and when the bugs are worked out and it's polished, I can't wait, but right now it's difficult to play.  Game froze and kicked me out when I tried to save.  First person movements and attacks are very blocky.  Support the developers if you want and try it out, but as of now it is difficult to put in real time.

Difficult to recommend and review negatively, because it is early alpha and very cheap.  Hope the developers follow up and deliver a killer game.",0,1

The rating that I can give to this game is 6/10.",0,1

"It's a real fun game but a note of warning to new players.

The plot is poorly structured in this game. After playing 13+ hours leveling up and getting powerful companions in different parts of the map, I would enter a town and suddenly a plot narrative will run and I will be meeting and talking to characters that I've never met before. I don't know why this is happening. Either I'm getting companions I'm not supposed to yet or that I'm at a higher level than I should be and the plot activates. This made the game unplayable for me as I'm kinda a story guy and I have to replay the whole game just to know what on earth happened. 

Also, after hours of research as a newbie and not getting an answer to cultivation books, here's a quick tip. You can ONLY have 4 cultivation books and each book you level up will directly change your HP and MP. If you remove the book, the benefits will leave until you supplant it with another book and level that up. However, whatever  meridian points you get from leveling up a cultivation book is permanent. So when peeps in reviews and forums say level up as many cultivation books as you can it's because they want the permanent meridian points. Remember, you remove the cultivation book, you remove the increase in HP and MP. 

Because the story is so integral to games such as these, think Octopath Traveller or Fire Emblems, I won't recommend the game until they fix the narrative plot points and stop it from running havoc. Because plot holes just made me scrunch my face like a bull dog and throw tantrums.",1,0
