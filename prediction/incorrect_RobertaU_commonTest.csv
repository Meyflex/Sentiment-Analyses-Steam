The reason why you should be using Steam in the first place.,0,1
"I really wish Steam had a 'maybe' recommendation, because this game fits into that. I usually give RPGs about 10 hours to get me hooked, and I gave this one 20 because I heard the story was great and compelling but the story didn't go anywhere during the 20 hours I played. If I hear 'you have to put 40 in to like it' then I say go play an MMO if you're into that.  Overall, the combat is fun. I really liked it, but that might be because you never actually get to use it. You get some new gear and upgrade a few skill points and you're 1-hitting anything your level. Bosses are challenging, until you go into the superpower mode and kill each and every one. Quests aren't very compelling and the talking goes on forever without much reason for me to care about anybody. Not only that but one of the DLC's storylines about giants, which I was interested in, had a glitch that prevented me from finishing it without restarting completely. Awesome.  The graphics are cool and you know what, I wish this game had multiplayer. If it had 2 or even 4 player co-op, it would be awesome. I would have so much fun playing with other people, but the lack of enemies to kill, lack of cares I give, and lack of anything interesting in almost a day playing makes it where I don't feel happy recommending this game.",1,0

"Not a bad game for a genre clone - this wannabe fable wannabe skyrim features gnomes instead of dwarves and Fae instead of elves, but other than that mostly conforms to the tolkien rules. The 'young races,' humans (which are subdivided into skyrim-like factions), are in danger of extinction because of the 'crystal war,' where the Fae 'Tuatha' have declared war because ♥♥♥♥ it, ♥♥♥♥ humans, I guess. The player is in the ever-imaginative position of an amnesiac who somehow has mastery of all weapon types, who wakes up as the Tuatha raid a gnommish outpost and from there I pretty much just stopped paying attention. The story is not very exciting.  The 'Destiny' system, where the player can build themselves between the three fantasy rpg classtypes (if you dont know what those are, this game would not be a great place to enter the fantasy genre), is a great idea, especially if you're a completionist and you want to see what total hybridization has to offer. The way the trees build is a little stupid though - there are like 9 types of weapons and you can put points into one weapon type at a time - if you go for full hybrid, like I did, you pretty much just suck with everything, which is what I expected. The level cap is ♥♥♥♥ing 40, which is GARBAGE - there are about 120 point slots for each classtype, so you can basically unlock a total THIRD of the potential of your game (I used a save editor to give myself more points because it was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). Gold is too readily available and doesn't restrict purchases at all, and the gear tries to be like diablo but it just....isn't. The looting is a little stupid. I'd give this game about a C, it captures attention at first but its flaws just rear up and are impossible to ignore. I loved tossing around chakrams and screw-attacking through people with my warrior-rogue-mage hybrid, but I got so bored I just left-clicked my way through the last third of the game.",1,0

"This is one of those nostalgia ♥♥♥ games people can't get away from. This game brought in many new ideas to make Call of Duty what it is today and is considered to be the best in the franchise.  Yes. This game has an amazing soundtrack, maps, and guns, but unfortunately this game is horrifically unbalanced, ugly textures and graphics, full of hackers, and a terrible campaign.  It's one of those games where even though you hate it, you always go back to it eventually.  It's like a terrible drug where you know it's bad for you, but you want to keep using it.

"Because I'm such a huge fan of CS:GO and CS:S, I decided to purchase and play the original Counter Strike. However good the game may be it's all based on petty nostalgia. If you were to compare the game to CS:S or CS:GO you would realize how inferior it really is to the two. You might say that CS:GO turned crap once Valve added cases and payed cosmetics, and in turn that makes CS 1.6 better than CS:GO. To that I say CS:GO has better graphics (no surprise) and better controls, if it's the payed skins that turn you away from the game then just don't buy skins/cases/keys. Overall I would say based on CS 1.6's time period it's a revolutionary game, however compared to modern choices the game is ♥♥♥♥.  5/10",1,0

"For it's $20 dollar price tag it's probably one of the best choices for Call of Duty's out there. The main problem being is that there's a large amount of hackers in the game, or hacked lobbies. Still, you you want an occasional Call of Duty game to play, this might be a good pick up.",1,0

"A great game left to decompose.   As much as I enjoy playing this time to time, there are a few reasons why you shouldn't get into it. That's all up to you to decide however.  First, the good:  1. Fairly adult playerbase, I guess mainly because most are the original players from the day.  2. I haven't played Campaign in many years, in fact since I completed it, about 5 years ago, but I remember it was pretty good. 3. Fastpaced multiplayer action.  4. This game doesn't attempt at stealing all your freetime like some other games do, it's fun, but not addictive. 5. This works on Mac, I am not sure if other CoDs don't, but one of my friends recently bought this because it was Mac compatible.   Now the bad:  1. Hackers. It wasn't always nearly as bad as it is now. I am not sure how it works exactly, but InfinityWards seems to not have updated their anticheat system for a few years now and just about any lobby is permiated with a hacker as a result.  2. Unbalanced weapons. I'd guesstimate that 65% of all players use UMP, which is a clear sign your game isn't very well balanced. Some things like reloading on the Intervention has clearly been artificially slowed down, to balance stats out I guess, but still, it's not pretty and it stands out a country mile.   3. It's bloody expensive! I mean, this is 2015 we are living here and this came out in 2009 and it costs 20 USD, which isn't far off what it was at time of its release, I am thinking 7-10 USD maybe? I know it's CoD and CoDs must be expensive by law, but still... If you are going to have a 6 year old game still available for purchase, maybe make it more appealing by offering it at a lower price?  4. Playerbase is small, as You would expect, you'd have to work out the hours when most people come on, otherwise tough luck getting into a SnD when there's like one lobby hosted in the world.   5. Motherf***ing Kicktool! I am not quite sure where IW's common sense was when they allowed people to use that thing, my guess is that this supposed to let people rid of hackers, well no, usually it's used by a-holes to rid off people they cannot outskill. Very quite dissapointing.   I would pass on buying this if I were you, I am sure there are better options for your 20 USD.",1,0
"People were saying that this game has a long installation time, however, my computer (which downloaded [PROTOTYPE] in 7 hours) downloaded it in 42 seconds flat. BUT the VERIFICATION took ages to do.

It used to be the best game I ever played but now it's literally dead except for hackers, campers and ofcourse trolls. To bad that the newer games don't give the same feeling like this one did. I guess it's time to say goodbye and finally uninstall it.  May my memory of this game stay always in my mind and the pure joy that I felt, shall stay in my heart. RIP &lt;/3",1,0

"6/10  Its a game worth a try but only worth a try.Campaign is not that boring and can be attractive to some players.Also have a unique concept. There are 2 deadly flaws in this title in my opinion: 1.Too many useless battles,so you usually get bored after 2hours 2.The limited times to use skills,for more times?you need to buy at a high price in store.I really dont know why design like this,so the game gets more and more boring because you dont want to try different skills but only want to end every battle fast,its a big failure.But enemies dont,they always have 10+times to use and they only mean to get you stucked one time,so more and more hard battles but looked the same.",1,0

"The only negative thing I could find (apart from the difficulty of obtaining the Black Rose and the virus, as people claim) was the thought given to naming the classes.  Rifle Man, Sniper, and Point Man. I understand not wanting to have any similarity to Team Fortress 2, for example, but you got to think your names through. Another alternative would be to give the classes real names.  Lastly, I personally think players are more interested in video games that have a backstory to them. Take Team Fortress 2. The comics explain a great deal of things that happen in-game.  In conclusion, I would give this game 4 out of 10 stars.",1,0

"There is no Co-op in this game, so basicly the steam lied to me about it, but it's 'okay' (i searched for a good co-op game when I bought it).  This game is like Fable in so many ways.

I read about the game time, 40 hour if you really now what are you doing, 100+ if not. Too much maybe?  So many cool things, but still, so many thing missed, so many part of the game is empty, 'cheap'.

"Postal 2 won't go down in history as one of the greatest games of all time. It probably won't even make the average top 500 list. That said, I thought it was very entertaining. When it comes to Postal III, I'm at a loss for words. I'd prefer to write a positive review, describing in detail on how this game improved on its predecessor. If necessary, I could write a negative review, filled to the brim with reasons as to why I believe this product to be a disappointing sequel. Instead, I'm staring into the abyss.  The Postal Dude is at it again. After blazing a trail of death and destruction through the town of Paradise, he finds himself in Catharsis. Madcap mayhem and wacky hijinks await as Postal Dude tries to find a paying job. Will you somehow find the light of virtue within yourself? Or will you once again submit to your demons, using murder to solve every minor dilemna? Whatever the case, you're sure to be in for a great time. This game also stars Ron Jeremy and Jennifer Walcott. I'm surprised that Lloyd Kaufman didn't make an appearance as well.  This entry uses a morality system. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean The Postal Dude will be helping old ladies cross the street (or into woodchippers). Basically, if you want to be the good guy, you have to abide by the law. Naturally, this requires that you become a police officer, and make the law your own. While this doesn't give you a free pass to endanger innocent lives, at least you're doing your part to make Catharsis a safer(?) place. If that sounds like too much trouble, you can always be evil incarnate. This will result in different levels, and eventually a bad ending, if you don't change your ways. If eternal damnation doesn't appeal to you, there's always the handy taser gun. Non-lethal takedowns slowly add up, allowing you another opportunity to join the force when you complete the level. Unfortunately, the possibility exists that your morality, will be at the mercy of the game itself.  While I applaud the writers for their attempt at injecting more story into the Postal saga, things stop making sense very early on. I suppose this can be attributed to the fact that I had to skip stages in order to progress. Let me rephrase that: I had to cheat* just to complete this game. Aside from the high probability of crashes, there are numerous scripting issues. Some doors are scripted to open when an event occurs. For reasons that can surely be attributed to the troubled development of the game, these scripts frequently break.   To give an example: Shortly after I joined the force, I was tasked with eliminating the homeless that were running rampant through the police station. Eventually I reached a point where a door was supposed to open, but it didn't. I could see the enemy's guns clipping through the door, but there was nothing I could do about it. I restarted the level, which fixed it. However, there was another door later on in the level, and it had the exact same issue. This happened again in another level, where I was supposed to go to the mall, the doors simply wouldn't open.   Unlocking all of the stages in Postal III via cheats is a simple task, but that isn't the point. All that work I did trying to be a good Postal Dude? Gone. Putting difficulty aside, when a game can't be completed without resorting to cheats, that means it is broken.  Postal III tends to feel like busy-work. Most of the levels start off with an extremely boring job, which fits in with the story. After a short time, things get crazy when Soccer Moms or Savage Nerds or Eco-Terrorists or ???? show up. This is the point where you have to kill/subdue a certain number of them so that the level will end. Postal 2's strength wasn't in standard FPS mechanics. A lot of the entertainment came from using the sandbox aspects. It was a game designed around finding different solutions for everyday problems (sometimes without murder). With Postal III, almost the entirety of the product involves shooting, and it is very poorly-handled. The Postal Dude can take cover, but it's so ineffective you're sometimes better off standing out in the open. On the bright side, the enemy AI is so bad they're liable to ignore or even forget about you in the heat of combat. The levels that don't require the player to deal with x amount of enemies, tend to be really linear slogs. There are even escort missions, as if players wouldn't have enough reasons to hate this game.   Aside from severe technical faults such as long load times and poor performance, Postal III also suffers from awful mechanics. Melee is basically useless. Even the heavier weapons, like the fire ax, don't work all that well. One of the items you acquire is a laser pointer, for leading Champ (your dog) to enemies. It is complete trash. The same can be said about most of Postal III's weapons. There's no real incentive to play with them, because they either don't work, or just aren't satisfying. Typically, the average Postal III play-through is going to revolve entirely around shooting everything. It gets old very quickly. Urinating is no longer infinite either. The Postal Dude can't ♥♥♥♥ as much as he wants, now he has to wait for his bladder to refill. Yes, it's probably an unnecessary thing to complain about, but it's still a nonsensical change that adds nothing to the game. Everything about Postal III is worse than its prequel...Everything**.  Some of you reading this review might not care about Postal. You might even think 'It's a garbage franchise anyway. Who cares?' Well, it's just my opinion, but I liked the second game. It was crass, offensive, and sometimes the humor fell absolutely flat. Yet underneath all of the nastiness, there is still a game. Postal III is broken, and is more prone to cause headaches than provide any entertainment value. The multitude of bugs, scripting failures, and generally unfun game-design, make for a forgettable entry in this controversial series.  *While I did cheat to complete a couple stages, I didn't actually try to skip any.  **The soundtrack is pretty decent.

May be a while down the road, but I imagine they will eventually.  Having played this game for several hours, I have gotten into several modded servers. Granted, getting into a normal server was as easy as backing out &amp; searching again, but the thing is, this game sees like 600-800 players MAX on a good day. So you're not always going to be able to back out &amp; get into a normal server. You will sometimes back out &amp; then just rejoin the same modded server.  The negative aspect out of the way, this is still the same old MW2 you played years ago. It plays just the same &amp; when you DO get into a noraml server, it's loads of fun! I've never had any issues getting into full servers either, so it's got that going for it.   As far as hackers &amp; modders goes, I have never personally came across one, or if I did, I didn't notice. It's just the modded servers you have to watch out for. Play on those to long &amp; you could get slapped with a VAC Ban!  All in all this is a good game, but i really wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than die hard MW2 fans, or people trying to complete their CoD collection. It's a dying game! Yes it will ALWAYS have a player base, (mainly the hardcore MW2 fans) but if you're just getting into PC gaming, or looking for a new FPS, I would tell you to buy Call of Duty 4 instead. There are 4,000+ ACTIVE servers in that game &amp; the number of active players grow every day!",1,0

"Runespell Overture is a card game with kind of original mechanic, blending the combinations from poker with tactical moves from Arcomage - where you collecting some points to use them on some spell, which will either attack your opponent or defend yourself better.  Point one is that it is NOT a Role-Play Game, it is only a card game with 'health points' on you and your enemies, and some grades of combinations to win the hand. Point two is that Arcomage - and many games alike - are still Much Better by the terms of gameplay.  As a Pro point, I like the visual stylistics of the Runespell, the way it's presenting itself - it has a good facade, so to say. Game mechanic and scenario combined creating good impression, which follows you in first third, maybe first half of the whole game. But then... then you notice, that the challenge is not anything intense, and just proceeding using quite the same basic combinations - basically doing all the same over and over... and at that point, you'll be not so happy.  The story is okay for that type of game... but nothing fancy or really rewarding for your struggle to beat dozens of almost similar enemies - and even bosses are not much different! To finish the impression, Runespell: Overture is maybe short (about 5-10 hours of gameplay), but holds one bugged achievement, which I can't complete even after 30+ hours... do I need to tell you how I love such things?  Oh, well, I'll just mark it with 5.5/10, and leave it be. Do not recommend, as there are enough of better card games, even in the F2P ghetto.",1,0

"I do enjoy the game, and I think it is a good way to quench your thirst for a game of this style. With more work this game could have really been amazing. An active modding community would even be plenly enough to save it. But sadly we will not be seeing any more progress on it. I suck at adding pros so i'll just be going into the details on the cons. (sorry if i am a bit too harsh)  Worth the purchase?  I would say the game is worth a buy when it is on sale, or if you are like me and don't have a pc able to run things like The Witcher 3 or Shadow of Mordor.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  + Overall fun gameplay and combat. Easy to get into and can find a good amount of things to do.  + The main story is pretty good. Really new and interesting plot.  + The respec system allows you to completely change your playstyle at any point for a small fee of gold.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  - Poor difficulty scaling.  Apparently when you enter a new area, it locks that area to your current level. So if you progress too fast or, like me, end up charging across the map in search of a challenge, the whole game becomes a cakewalk. (besides a few special enemies that do stupidly high damage compared to the rest)  I have heard that this also works for chests, so looting everything too early will hurt you in the end.  - Conversations seem to be lacking. Persuasion skill is useless.  I quickly found myself skipping through dialogue to reach choices to get past it, that often make no difference besides the next line the npc says. I even tried to make a few npcs hate me but nothing happened. (And apparently I am now lovers with some girl even though all I did was use her boat.)  The Persuasion skill, having 10 whole ranks, only affects the chance for you to succeed in rare, often pointless dialogue options, that you could just pass by quicksaving/loading. There are also a couple milestones in it, but all they do is slightly lower the cost of bribes for crimes.  - Equipment.  Many people say that upgrading your blacksmithing skill makes getting good gear too easy, but it seemed like the opposite for me. With max rank blacksmithing i only ever made a few items worth using since I could never find good materials , and ended up just selling all of my loot and purchasing better gear from shops.  Armor sets just stink. I have done a lot of exploring and looting but have never found more than 2 parts of a set besides when given to me. And even if I had, my gear would still be far better. Same story for most of the special weapons I get.  - Side quests are annoying.  There are a few I have done that I found interesting and enjoyable, but mostly it just became a case of skipping through, accepting everything, just doing them as I went to an area with an objective there.  This could also just be because I have played too many mmoprgs.  - Not enough variety in enemies.  Throughout the game you will be finding the same enemies even in far different settings, such as trolls, spiders, and pretty much any people. Even being in different reigons and factions, they will have the same attacks and skills.  - Plenty of annoying bugs and things that could do with improvement.  I have had quests break multiple times, even once before causing me to have to start a whole new game.  When you disable an enemy in reckoning mode, your character will still try to target them.  And many more little issues...",1,0

"Welcome to the world’s most fun over rated pile of ♥♥♥♥.   Since I first got a PC nearly 3 years ago all I have ever heard is counter strike, counter strike, counter strike. And, after about 15 hours of play time I see why.   Right away I can see that when counter strike came out it was the magnum opus of the fps/multiplayer genre and I can respect that but that also explains the largest problem with counter strike, its nonexistent learning curve. For the first maybe 3 hours I played on a few different servers and never killed a single person. I figured I’m new to this and it seems as thoe these guys/girls have been playing much longer than I have been so I began to brush it off and then 2 hours and may servers later I had killed maybe 6 people, not much had changed. And then remembered that that’s stupid, I shouldn’t be playing against people that have 150 hours clocked while I have 5.  Another problem is the weapons  I can understand the weird names, Valve would have been a smaller company then and saved a buck by naming them weird stuff but that doesn’t mean I won’t still make fun of them. The damaged ratio is also complete ♥♥♥♥♥. The sniper rifle is a one hit kill the subs are useless and I was once hit across the map with a shot gun blast. The knife is a bit under powered but Thats better than it being a light saber. And For some reason the only guns that are ever used are the AK look alike the M16 look alike and the sniper rifle.   I should say that counter strike is not a bad a game. It's for sure a sextillion times better than any Call of Duty ever made. And I will confess that this game is more fun giving your friends ADHD kid a gram of cocaine and telling him his dad is made of candy. But it’s also as frustrating as trying to put that same kid in a car seat. ",0,1

"If you like shooting the bad guys then this is one of the games for you. When Counter-Strike was originally released in 2000, I didn't play it because I was like 1 year old. I play it now because of the fast/slow paced actions and the guns. There are a bunch of guns in Counter-Strike that you can use. There are little guns that are cheap, and big guns that are expensive. But here lies the problem with Counter-Strike... people don't even use all of the guns! Whenever I find onto a server, all of the players are only using the black gun, the brown gun, the silver gun, and the green gun. Even though there is a bunch of weapons, they aren't really all used much of the time. In the end, I play Counter-Strike because my computer is afraid of Counter-Strike: Source.",0,1

"Well, this one is quite a hard one for me.   For starters, it was a blast, like discovering a jewel that has been sitting in front of you all of the time without you noticing it. I was like, 'Why didn't I know this game did exist at all?' And so I was really hooked to it for a couple of hours. A couple of dozens of hours.   A really pretty game. Big and stable (at least for me). WIth a funny and fluent combat system (I would dare to say in the likes of Dark Souls, Darksiders or Blade: Edge of Darkness (things tend to get dark when combat systems are cool, it seems)). With a slightly original setting from your usual fantasy RPG and inmersive too. Decent crafting, voice acting and music...  But then it started to feel a bit shallow. As if you were playing an MMOPRG, but without the social interaction. Quests started to feel repetitive, the NPCs less charming, the story not that interesting. Everything was a bit of a chore.   Worst of all, I felt no challenge at all. Even when the combat felt right and was funny, this has to be the ONE game for me in which I NEVER died. Not once. In the whole of the game. Not a single failed combat situation, and let me tell you it is a long way to complete it. I know there are roundabouts for this (both patches and even set paths to keep you a wimp for the whole of the main story around the web), but this is clearly not right.  So, at the end, I wouldn't recommend it. It gave me plenty of hours of enjoyemet a the star, but left me empty and a bit angry by the mid-end game. If you can get it on sale (not very often, I think) go for it, but else, I wouldn't do so.  Cheers,",1,0

"why needed to kill this game? it was and will be the best fps shooter ever, feel like CS:GO just a ♥♥♥♥ ...   i think the worst idea ever is the 'promod delete', thats a greatest game than Global :)   Im playing since 15 years, had 30+ lan event in Hungary, and i think just should have to use global achievement, LOUNGE (skins,trading,betting,etc..) and matchmaking functions, we have been a great geam what every counter player like, and want to play in any event...   the real counter strike will never die! and original half life engine is the best ever!",0,1
"First at 8 years, since in 2007, A friend comed at my house and installed me a cracked version of Counter - Strike 1.6 . Well I played it like one thousand hours , my friend moved in other country, and when I was playing someone destroyed my CS. I didn't know how to install it again, so i watched on youtube ,I reinstalled it again, That story with the destroy repeats like 2-3 times. I started to be an admin at 10 years, yes 10 years baby, I was doing requests to be an admin and i was telling them i was from 15 to 25 :D Well servers that i was an admin closed , get to the next one , when this closed , to the next one and like that. I always knew that servers close because there is a lot of money to pay to have one. At 12 years i discovered Steam. The first year I did't have any friend on steam because i Haved a ♥♥♥♥ laptop and i was not able to play call of duty 1 on 30 fps. I continued to be an admin on servers. 1 year ago I discovered an server that I love, I have some great owners that are very nice, and some day the owners decided that the admins need to buy Counter-Strike 1.6 . I don't planned to buy Cs 1.6 on steam because i already have it cracked , but i loved the server so much that i buyed it on steam! I think that i have like 5000 hours of play with cracked CS's :)  I totally recommend this game! 11/10  Love CS 1.6! &lt;3",0,1

"I used to play this a few years ago and this was a game worth playing. The campaign mode was good, the multiplayer mode was decent and it ran smoothly. I have started playing once more for the past three months and I will admit. I have had enough! The campaign may still be good (although it runs a little slower for me now) but the worst thing about this game is the darn multiplayer.  Allow me to tell you why for this one very good reason in my humble opinion:  It has been hacked to oblivion- I click to play TDM in the game mode selection menu, I wait to be connected to what appears to be a TDM and I somehow land up playing Domination. What makes things worse is that the host can reset the match at the end without allowing you to change up your classes in the after match intervals. This means you go straight back into to domination ON A TDM SERVER CHOICE. This, added with lightning fast quick scopes, grenade launcher addicts, bunny hoppers (people whom jump and shoot/ avoid fire), spawn campers (sitting near enemy respawning places to get easy kills) and the aimbots makes for a very unpleasent gaming experience.   While Treyarch/Activision and ect will have likely to have been furiously working away to conjure a new way to make the public £100 poorer with a sequal to a previous title, they have been forgetting to make sure that their older releases are still being maintained for the enjoyment of hardcore loyalists to the older games that were released. No anti-hack updates or PunkBuster equivilent software has been created to stave away the hackers which suck the joy out of everything.  This may be irrelevant now as no one will be buying this or caring anymore. However I hope the developers are aware that yes, there are still people who play the older games and unfortunately people sad enough to hack them also (probably because they are better than the recent ones i.e Ghosts and Advanced Warfare in my opinion are enormous piles of rubbish trying to keep up with Halo). Getting back to this game, I would not recommend it because of how frustratingly terrible the game has become to even attempt to play. If you want to be hounded by the feinds listed above then go for it, but not for me as I have had my fill and so with that I conclude by saying: consider yourselves warned.",1,0

"Take on the role of Alex Mercer, a man who has no recollection of what’s happened to him or why, or how he came to acquire the shape-shifting powers he now possesses. Find the people who’ve done that to you and make them pay. The game -action, adventure, open worldish- sounded fun and looked fun, and I was very hyped to play it. I was also very disappointed when I finally did. Controls, though a bit wonky, are not difficult. You can change your body “at will” to attack enemies and destroy things, and when I say “at will” I mean you only have so many things you can change into. I think the most fun aspect of the game is the fact that you can ‘consume’ random people and then turn into them, and run/jump your way around pretty freely.   I’d say the graphics are dated, but it’s an oldish game, so it gets a slight pass for that. What it doesn’t get a pass for, however, is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance. For a 2009 game that should run like a charm on my computer, it sure worked like crap even at the lowest settings, lagging worse than Assassin’s Creed III - and at least that one had a reason to lag (no “low” video settings, hey). I’m also not particularly fond of the reddish/orangeish filter they use on later cinematics and gameplay time, I find it bothersome to look at.   Your character is overpowered, which is not bad in itself if you like an easy game, but it does make things boring after a while as it’s all the same; to tell the truth, it reminded me a little of God Hand for some reason, only that one was actually fun to keep playing. With Prototype, I did the first few missions and was bored out of my mind - that along with the slightly eye-hurting graphics and slight, random spikes of lag made the game truly disappointing.  The gameplay is pretty repetitive otherwise. Fight a bunch of bad guys, have them call in tanks and an airstrike, be chased, shake them off, rinse and repeat with a moderate variety of enemies and mutants to fight against.   It’s not a completely unplayable game, mind you. If you’re extremely bored and want to play something that doesn’t pose a huge challenge, it’s not a bad game and could even be considered entertaining. I liked the city, the chance to explore it some, the general idea of the game was good (though the story was a bit hit and miss with me), but the execution left a lot to be desired.  Perhaps if the game had lagged a bit less I would have enjoyed it a bit better.  I wouldn’t recommend this game, but I would certainly not tell you to steer clear from it either, as I feel it could be a lot more fun if you can actually play it sans the lag.",1,0

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

"You are 14 years old, first time trying to play something multiplayer and online. You see this game, since you have a potatoe PC you start to play this game. Runs smoothly on 53 FPS, woow sounds are great, look an AK-47 but name CV-47 you play it you shoot, you get killed asking yourself how you didn't kill him cause you shot 27 bullets on that guy and he still is alive. You play it over and over, finally getting your first kill. (cause the enemy was coruching and looking the other way and you instantly kill him running 17 bullets spent) you get high hopes, I can play this game it is so easy. You get more kills, you get greedy you rush alone you get killed when you even thought about rushing by an AWP on mid. Ages pass, poeple pass, kills get comon. You start to play better, after 2 years you learn the recoils you learn the hidding spots, you know what is the enemy's next move. You practise your awp then. You play DM and DM only with an awp, your kills are slick, and your flicks are quick and accurate. Admin invites you to his clan. FIrst time you play this game with somenone for serious. You can't do anything cause you are not used to an opposite player to play smartly and you get owned, you don't do kills and your teammates question your skill. Couple more months pass you learn your duties as a teammate. You give info you cover you open. Clan gets closed down, you find another clan you are one of the best players. You play more switch clans for better ones. You get to LANs you get scared of the all expecations and so many eyes on you. You tilt and miss your shots, months pass, you get better, you become a man of steel and high nervous, 2000 hours pass you are finally a great player. 10 000 hours pass, you win LANs you play against better players, you try a gainst payed players you are toe-to-toe with them but you loose cause your team isn't on that level and they get scared. 20 000 hours pass game is dying and so is your love for this game. But no one can pay thoose voice chats from 8 P.M till 6 A.M every weekend with your friends. So much hours in this game and you acomplished nothing. You play against your local teams you get banned cause they don't expect somene to play that good without cheats and you stop playing this cause cheaters take over, very 12 year old first downloads a cheat then this game. You get mentally tortured cause the kid is telling you how bad you are and that you suck, you cry inside. Thinking what happened to me, how come this kid plays better then me, then you figure out the cheats are great, but you still play it fairly. You cry cause no one cares for e-sports in your country and no one wants to pay you for playing games. Your parents tell you you don't have a life you loose some friends, you loose your girlfriend you stop being active in sports. YOu just play this game hoping to be recognised, but you don't so to help everyone in this world after 30 000 hours on this game, don't play it it is a sinking ship and it is pulling you down. Tears are in my eyes for all the time I was good but now you can't play a normal match since cheaters will destory you... run READER, move away, press back and never turn back on this game..",1,0

"Before I start I must explain that the reason I do not recommend this game is not because it is bad in any way, it is because its multiplayer is full of hackers/mods/spam and broken equipment (it also has no developer support).   The game is however very good, the single player has a gripping storyline that is full of action and great cinematic cut scenes. It includes a variety of wepons and settings so that each level is interesting, one level could take place in a desert and the next in a forest. There are intense moments and plot twists that really do get your emotions going, it's possibly one of my favourite story modes of all time. However it's slightly short and on veteran difficulty certain levels can be near impossible without touches of luck.  Single player also comes with 'spec ops' (which can be played co-operatively), spec ops adds another layer of difficulty to the story mode and alters story mode levels to suit a different challenge. It's divided up into a variety of categories including races so the diversity is enough to keep you playing when one type of mission is frustrating you. The frustration is worth it however as when difficult spec ops are completed you feel extremely satisfied.   Overall I would say it is a great game however its lack of developer support and its toxic hacking environment (online) mean it cannot be worth its price tag.",1,0

"How would I sum this game up ? Mediocrity at it's best. I mean the game is fine, it has all the necessary things for an action RPG, but the thing is you never get lost in it, the game doesn't suck you in as other games in this genre do. I just didn't feel that pull to return to the game, to find out what happens next.  I've played a few action RPGs - Mass Effect 1-3, Witcher 1,2, Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, TES: Oblivion, Skyrim and all of them made a much better impression on me.  The strange part is I can't actually point to one single thing that is wrong or broken in this game. I said it in the beginning - it's an ok game. But maybe that's it's downfall - it's just ok, it's kind of bland, nothing that stands out. It ticks all of the boxes for an RPG but never excels in any of them.  It's a forgetible experience for me and I jumped to other games very quickly. Compare that to my 100+ hours in each of the Fallout games and you can see the difference.  So would I recommend this game ? Well it depends. If you're a seasoned RPG player, then I'd say skip this game. It just doesn't have anything to offer that you haven't already experienced in other games in this genre. If you the type that absolutely has to play all RPGs out there, consider this game only if it is on sale. Now, for someona who is only starting his adventure with RPGs, I think this game might be a good starting point. It has all the basic mechanics in it, it will introduce you to the concept of open world games and it will only get better once you move on to other, better titles.  I myself might pick it back up some time down the road, or maybe not. Right now there are more fun games in my catalog waiting to be palyed.",1,0

"In 2007, CoD:MW (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare) was released into a community that has a seemingly insatiable lust for more shooter action. They weren't just given another shooter, they were given a game that really pushed the genre considerably. Amazing single player campaign and adrenaline-pumped, fast-paced multiplayer action with perks and weapon sets set the new standard on how these FPS's are done. It left it's mark on gaming as a whole, so a sequel was inevitable and gamers couldn't wait. In fact - according to an eye-witness who works at my local Game Stop - MW2 '...became the best-selling game in history before it was even released', all being pre-orders (of course, #1 sellers are subject to change). Imagine their dissapointment when they got this...  Plot 1/10  ..was so convoluted, I can't tell you what it was. Everybody wants everybody dead except the protagonists, and the only solution is...killing everybody. It's a movie written by Michael Bay. That's all I have to say about the plot without spoiling it. If you don't care (which you shouldn't), highlight this big, black box.    You meet Soap in the third-person, but it's so akward and out of his character to hear him talk. Then when you get back to playing as him, he stops talking again. For the main character of the first game being linked into the second game, he's just so seemed; so tacked-on and uninteresting. All the characters from the last game are 'magically' back too, despite being shot in the back of the head with Desert Eagles. Captain Price is back, but his acting and dialogue couldn't be more out of character. He went from rough, clever, and a cold sense of humor, to this...My Little Pony....thing. He's overly polite with no backbone. Imagine Mufasa suddenly with the mentality of Patrick Star, and you're not far off. Further, everytime I hopped onto an escape vehicle, I knew someone was going to shoot me because it happens like 4 times. When General Shepard reveals himself as the bad guy, it wasn't exciting. It was met with a loud YAAAWN. The twist is where the game's story slips into a void like a balloon into a hurricane. The player also 'dies' too much. Not in gameplay, but more like a scripted event/cutscene thing. Once again, *yawn*. The only intriguing part is when the EMP wipes out most of America's power. You and your team navigate a deathly-silent ghost town. It's eerie and very realistic; the best part of the game.    The ending also plays out like every other cutscene in the game: 'Good job, now let's carry you off and tell you who the kill nex-' CREDITS; THAR'LL BE A SEEQUEL!  Graphics/Sound 8/10  I'll put these in the same category because I don't have much to say about them. MW2's sound and visuals are everything we expect from the series: excellent. The guns, the dust, the lighting, character models are all beautiful, and guns, tanks, explosions all sound great, too; so why an 8/10? Attentive gamers will notice that a majority of this game's voice cast is from Mass Effect. In fact, several things were just 'taken' from Mass Effect. For one thing, your CO's voice is the voice of Captain Anderson, and the voice of the general is the voice of Admiral Hackett. Oh, and the general's name? Sheperd. There's nothing wrong with being inspired, but I call this a lazy, rip off. Infinity Ward wasn't even trying. Maybe I'm just being picky, but this really rubbed me wrong despite Keith David's long career as voice actor for military-esque media.  Gameplay 5/10  Finally, gamers are starting to see the light with the release of CoD:Ghosts. It's the same. Darn. Game. Same rail-shooter scenes, same set pieces, same 'set bomb and run away' scene, same door breaching scene, same, same, same. We've been playing the same game since the original Call of Duty in 2003 and before that with the Medal of Honor series. It's been 11 years of the same game. It's time for CoD to die. You run forward, you kill the next thing that moves, and steadily march to the credit roll. Everything about it is so banal; boring to the point of painful. The graphics and sounds aren't enough to mask the bad gameplay and story. A pretty package doesn't make the bad contents good. You've played CoD before. Enough said.  Multiplayer also went downhill with unbalanced weapons and killstreak abilities that broke the game entirely. When you get 3 kills in one life, you get a UAV that reveals all enemies on the radar. However, these streak rewards stacked with one another, so you use the UAV to get a few more kills, and get a chopper. The chopper automatically gets you 5 more kills giving you an AC-130 gunship. Use THAT for a few more kills, you get a nuke that ends the game instantly. Sounds pretty ambitious on pen and paper, but in game it means: first to a 3 kill streak WINS. Hackers also had their way with the game and Infinity Ward/Treyarch/Activision or all three refused to do anything about it. I've heard rumors that the same hacks that worked on MW2 also worked on MW3 and Black Ops. Watching this trend, I believe it.   If you want an example of customer service done RIGHT, let's ask Valve. Some time ago, Steam was glitching up and improperly banning players from accessing MW2. Gabe Newell wrote a personal apology to these gamers, and offered them a free copy of Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2). While that was generous and very polite, that might have been a bad idea for the poor people that play L4D2, because all the teenage @***holes from this game are now trolling the L4D2 community (as if that game wasn't bad enough.)  The Verdict  Visually, there's little to complain about. MW2 is very realistic by sight and by sound. Some of the settings are creepy with ash blotting out the sun and smoke rising from decimated vehicles and climbing corpses to escape combat. The whole world is going crazy, but they couldn't make the player care less. Traversing the beautiful world is an uphill hike to the credits. Yearly releases also means the community will be widely divided and chopped thinner and thinner with each release, so there's no point in trying to play MP. MW2 is big pass. Maybe get it for 5 bucks and beat it once. Final score: 3/10 Almost no reason to buy it.",1,0

I would recommend this but actvision seem to think that £1 = $1 so i recommend 1 of these 4 ways.   1. Waiting for it to go on sale on a website like  amazon.com  or any other website that doesn't use pounds this one would be the safest but you would be having to wait (or buy it off sale would still be cheaper).  2. Use a VPN this would be the more difficult one out of the 4 due to them being slow and finding one that you can use.  3. Get someone to buy if for you this is the way i did it but i would recommend getting a friend that you can trust to do it because get a some you don't know to do it they could easily take the money and run.  4. Buying it with TF2 keys this is be the best one out of the 4 IMO because people on trading websites like tf2outpost put trades up for it that use the price of it when its on sale (this only when the game is on sale)you also can buy TF2 keys for cheap from the community market its just finding some on outpost that is selling it for the sale price because of the websites crappy auto bump feature.  Its a shame because this is a very good game but i just cant recommend something that thinks that $1 = £1,1,0

"This game has problems, but it’s one of the best ones you’ll ever play. I have so many memories with this game on an Xbox, so I decided to get it here while it was on special. The game started on the first try, but it’s a hassle to find a legit multiplayer game. Zombies are fun as always, but you will not find a lot of multiplayer games so get yourself some friends or play it solo.   Pros: Mods Amazing Campaign Multiplayer Zombies  Cons:  Does not save my online multiplayer progress, so I’m always starting from private Random crashes Not much zombie’s servers Multiplayer is full with modded maps and some hard to find legit ones Bluescreens on my PC  Game will sometimes not even open and stay in a black screen  You’ll waste way more time trying to fix all of these problems than actually playing, so get ready to read some 7 year old forms and going to some outdated websites no one ever goes to anymore.  This is an awesome game, but its way too complicated on a PC. I’ll rather play it on a console to just keep it sweet and simple. ",1,0

First please read the review because there are a lot of fanboys who downvote all negative ones just because you want me to think perfectly of this game!  Well first of all i wanna say i dont have much to say other than this game is amazing i have played it my entire life but not the steam version a pirated version and please dont hate me for that but the most stable version of this game is pirate version wanna know the reasons why? ok fine here they are: 1.CL_flushentitypacket error which is extremely annoying given the fact that it will lagg you out and it cant be fixed because most of the servers are against the fix and usually that fix doesnt even work. While that error occurs on pirated version too it occurs really rarely while on steam version it doesnt stop the whole damn game and it is either the server that will kick you for using that fix or VAC that will kick you if you are lucky and ban you and you arent even using the third party software!!! its a console FLIPPING COMMAND!!! 2.There are a ton of servers that have a virus that will rebind all of your keys to join their server once you join the server for the first time and honestly i dont know how will this benefit either the owner of the server or you because you cant even play the server normally you will just reconnect all over again when you try to do something and in all honesty if you do such thing on your server ♥♥♥♥ you and i hope you get cancer. But you might be thinking how is this connected to not buying this game? well simple and i have 2 reasons for that. First reason is that why do you want to spend money on a game that has this type of issue and second of all the reason why this is a biggie is that in pirated version of the game you can change your binds and it will all save but unlike the steam version the 'Synchronizing feature' will save stuff but if you change the binds it will come back because people who use this exploit can work their way around it and trust me you will encounter a lot of servers like that. But trust me i dont hate this game in fact this is the game that got me into pc gaming back in 2004 but is it worth it buying a game that doesnt benefit you in any way as a legal version? of course not but its not me thinking that this game is ♥♥♥♥ in fact its evolutionary its perfect and i have spent 1000+ hours outside of steam version and i gotta say i have been getting a lot less errors and a lot less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t messages from vac for me trying to fix this error and a lot less problems than i had with the LEGAL VERSION THAT SHOULD BE MORE OF A QUALITY THAN THE ILLEGAL VERSION!. And im not promoting piracy in fact i think its lame but this is the game that should be pirated because it doesnt offer anything good in legal version in fact it downgrades a lot but when there are 50000 people that are hidden off your charts of cs 1.6 just because they wanna play normally and pirate the game there is something seriously wrong with the legal version and i really dont recommend buying this its the same as the pirated version but with more game breaking stuff! ,1,0

"---World The game world feels small, but there's plenty of side quests for people like me who shun main quests in RPGs. Despite all the action, the game is heavily lore-based. Amalur is a side quest lover's fantasy. It is a shame that the story is not particularly worth paying attention to.  ---Gameplay Save often (every 30 seconds or so) because the controls are clunky. If you see an attack coming, but the PC is already performing an action, good luck trying to cast cancel.   The fact that all mobs spawn in groups means that if you get hit once, chances are you'll become stun-locked. Hard difficulty may be easy for might and magic builds, but provide plenty of death knells for finesse/stealth builds. The stealth system is essentially broken. If you're in stealth mode, enemies are essentially deaf and blind as long as you aren't in their narrow FOV. Even so, if you fail to kill a mob with one stealth backstab, they tend to turn around and instantly take out a chunk of your HP. The worst part is, such backstabs do negligible damage to those mobs. The worst mobs to face are magic based. Enemy magic spells are particularly difficult to dodge since most lock on to your position. It is impossible to select which enemy to attack, which is often problematic. The worst in when Reckoning mode is activated and the player character keeps swinging at an enemy that is already down. Note that my play style always involves a lot of kiting and an extreme aversion to using potions. I suspect that the game is easy even on hard if you have a build with a ton of HP.  The camera angles are shoddy. In combat, you sometimes cannot see what is happening if you are stuck near a wall. Often I run in the wrong direction because the camera pans awkwardly or because I cannot see what is behind me (the camera locks onto enemies during combat).  There is no way to toggle always running despite the fact that there is no fatigue bar. This makes it difficult to put some distance between the PC and mobs when you're trying to kite. You have to start jogging and then mash the run key, hoping that your PC will eventually start running.   The invisible walls everywhere get really annoying quickly. If you get a destiny card that replaces dodge with blink, save often. There is no console, so if you blink and get stuck you will have to reload.  The best part of the game is that you can respec at just about any time as long as you have the money. It is really easy to make money in Amalur.  ---Visuals Amalur's brightness and overexposure lends to vivid scenery and a cartoony feel. It's jarring enough that you might want to consider using an ENB/SweetFX injector.  ---Audio The music is not very memorable or particularly immersive, but at least it does not play continuously. It follows the Elder Scrolls school of musical cues so you'll know when combat starts and ends if you have the music turned on.    ---Final Thoughts I wish more RPGs had a similar combat system, but with less delay between input and action. Amalur has some good ideas, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.",1,0

"I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that.",1,0
5/10 Okay game in my opinion at the time. It did not do much to stand out with all the shooters that came out around the same time frame. For that it got 'average'. I prefer the realism and gameplay of Battlefield over this shooter. There are newer versions out there so I (if this was the only option for me) would skip this and get the newer CoD that has more 'realism' and overall better feel. Plus more people are playing online on the newer one and more players = better match making leading to a happier gamer :),1,0

For a game to not take serously and just be a ♥♥♥♥ being a noob its quite fun. If you are planning to take it serous i wouldn't recommend this game at this period of time do to the fact of the mass amount of nerds in the game makes it hard to begin as well as the high chance of getting a hacker in the lobby using aimbot or some crap like that. Other than that the killstreaks seem too extreme and that it is pretty easy to get spawned killed. So If you don't give a crap and your playing with a friend and you want to make a some 10 year old no life nerd rage bc you ruin their killstreak by noobtubing then this is the game for you.,1,0

"I had this game on the PlayStation3 and it was kinda enjoyable. Ripping and tearing apart innocent citizens and soldiers alike, destroying everything, ellbow-slamming a tank - there will be gore and explosions everywhere. Sounds decent, right?  A little.  Only problem is the controls where a bit clunky (even on the PS3) and I had massive problems focussing and attacking the enemy I actually wanted. Another funbreaker is the fact that you're easily being bounced back, even by small and weak enemies. It's even worse when stronger enemies and helicopters chase you. Sometimes you're feeling like a ball in a pinball machine.  This game has so much potential and with proper implementation this propably would have been the best anti-aggression-game and there is. I mean, you have all those amazing powers! From disguise to running at super speed to hammerfists (lets you smash tanks), clawhands (rips and tears everything apart), whiplash (for taking down distant enemies), superjumping, semi-flying (gliding). You can even throw buses into helicopters and stuff, the list goes on and it's awesome.  But you're almost not able to live it up.  The story is ok and acceptable. The missions are way too hard and not fun at all (I'm not a good gamer, though). In one mission you have to flee. Excuse me? I'm a godlike creature and can destroy a tank with a single blow with my ellbow, why the heck should I flee?  That's boring and uninspiring. It's like getting a Lamborghini in a racing game and the game tells you to drive not faster than 30 miles per hour. Unfortunately, I didn't find any cheats or mods for this game. I think with a little effort like removing all the time based missions and the bouncing this would be just awesome.  If you can get this game for a decent price (it's under 10 dollars mostly, on Humble Bundle even cheaper) and if you do like gore, GO GET IT and happy ripping and tearing bodies apart for a while. I really hope you could do an devastator attack on some people out there who are wasting so much potential. It hurts, especially as a creative person.",1,0

However this is not the end i suppose i can still find some enjoyment out of the game after all it is call of duty even if i wish i could get my 10 dollars back... would recomend this game on xbox and play station Not pc,1,0

"Single Player:   Pros:  Simple. Clean. Fun. Fun missions that are well designed and complex. Game mechanics are an improvement compared to COD 4.  Cons:  Terrible Storyline. Get's boring. I can only play it for like 45 minutes in one sitting until I get bored out of my mind.   Multiplayer: Just terrible frankly, almost no one plays it anymore and the ones that do are all hackers. No point in playing it.  Conclusion: Decent game, but you're probably better off playing a different COD, such as Black Ops or any of the more recent ones (Ghosts, Advanced Warfare), or waiting for BO3 which looks pretty damn good.

"Okay let me first start off with saying this... This game is NOT worth $20!!!!!!! If you're really wanting to get this game, please do yourself a favor &amp; wait until Steam puts it up for sale. May be a while down the road, but I imagine they will eventually.  Having played this game for several hours, I have gotten into several modded servers. Granted, getting into a normal server was as easy as backing out &amp; searching again, but the thing is, this game sees like 600-800 players MAX on a good day. So you're not always going to be able to back out &amp; get into a normal server. You will sometimes back out &amp; then just rejoin the same modded server.  The negative aspect out of the way, this is still the same old MW2 you played years ago. It plays just the same &amp; when you DO get into a noraml server, it's loads of fun! I've never had any issues getting into full servers either, so it's got that going for it.   As far as hackers &amp; modders goes, I have never personally came across one, or if I did, I didn't notice. It's just the modded servers you have to watch out for. Play on those to long &amp; you could get slapped with a VAC Ban!  All in all this is a good game, but i really wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than die hard MW2 fans, or people trying to complete their CoD collection. It's a dying game! Yes it will ALWAYS have a player base, (mainly the hardcore MW2 fans) but if you're just getting into PC gaming, or looking for a new FPS, I would tell you to buy Call of Duty 4 instead. There are 4,000+ ACTIVE servers in that game &amp; the number of active players grow every day!",1,0
"This game is bad. But it is that cheesy kind of bad which everybody (OK, die-hard fans of Disciples) like. I suppose the guys tried to sort of remake the Disciples II but got short on money halfway through. In Reincarnation you get no playable Dwarves but you get see and play your good ol' undead and demons and humans from DII. Buuut, the units are imbalanced which is topped by a fiendish in-game interface and bugged scripts which render the some missions incompletable. But hey, bugs, interfacece and level scaling (yep, seriously the game expects you to topple 30level enemy during first campaigns mission when you max level is 5) aside, the storyline seems pretty enjoyable so far.",1,0

"Ok, so Kingdoms of Amalur. After watching the trailer when it was on sale, and looking up some reviews, I decided to buy it. Straight off the bat, I came across my first problem. When the game was done downloading, I counldnt see anything. I can hear the audio just fine, but the visuals didnt show. (and no its not my graphics card, it can easily handle it [Amd A10-5745M Apu with Radeon]) So i deleted it and reinstalled it. It worked so i continued to play. After the turtorial, I agreed with most if not all players that the combat is EXTREMELY FUN. I was somewhat bewildered and happy with this new combat mechanic. But the fun combat cannot cover the other complaints I have. First off, the characters are really boring. Not just the npcs, but your player as well. Though a somewhat interseting backstory, it doesnt grip me enough to play on. Same with the plot. The unintersting story, just doesnt flow well.(Dont worry about spoliers, beacuse i dont even know whats the plot) Maybe its due to the fact that Ive only played the game for 3 hours, and it picks up later on, but if it does, then thats a fail for a rpg. Or any game for that matter. These flaws already is a turn down for me. Fighting makes only half of an rpg, and story and character devlopment as the other(where this game fails to achive). There are a couple of minor flaws, but I think its more of a play style prefernce. So my verdict:5/10. A decent rpg with an extremely fun fighting mechanic, but lacks in essensial rpg elements. If this were a free game, i wouldve cared less, and probably wouldve given it a positive review, but if Im BUYING an rpg game, I EXPECT an rpg game.",1,0

"A perfect example of a game that looked so good on paper but was executed so badly it was exiled to a corner and no one wants to mention it today. All in all KoA: Reckoning is a solid RPG, it has a huge world with tons of NPC's and quests, it has rich lore behind the world that, most of the time, makes sense, and the game introduces things like the lorestones and Reckoning Mode to spice things up both on the RP side and the Action side.  Unfortunately pretty much every aspect of this game falls flat. The talent system is pretty redundant and mostly serve to give you passive bonuses you can fit your playstyle around (!), as any true RPG blacksmithing and enchanting is as overpowered as a Predator and the dialog is sometimes so bad that you wish you bought the game on a CD-disc just so you could throw it out the window.  All in all, if you're looking for the next Icewind Dale, Masquerade: Bloodlines or Dark Souls, this is not it. But if you wish for a Bulletstorm with magic instead of guns then this game will cuddle and snuggle you warm forever. Or at least the 50hours it takes to explore the world.",1,0

"First off, don't get fooled by my played hours, I've been playing it way before it was avaiable on steam but I didn't touch it since around 1.5 years. I would estimate that my played hours are somewhere around 3k, I've also participated in 2 tournaments. I would still love this game and recommend it to everyone and their grandma if Aeria wouldn't have messed up AVA like they did.  AVA was a great game back when ijji published it, it had great potential. The maps are great, nothing to complain about here. You could buy Weapons, Grenades and Armor for ingame money. You would get money relatively slow, but once you hit 50-60k € you could buy a decent, permanent weapon and that's pretty much all you needed. You also need money to repair that weapon and buy parts for your weapon that need to get replaced regularly. Getting 50-60k could take up to 1-2 months, depending on how much you played. You could still spend real money on weapons in order to get them immediately. It still was not pay to win at all. The graphics were actually decent for a F2P game. You would encounter hackers from time to time, depending on whether there were any free hacks out there or not.  Ever since Aeria games took over things changed. Their biggest failure was the removal of permanent weapons, which ultimately made the game pay to win. You could only buy weapons for 30 days, then they expired. The price of a decent weapon was still around 50-60k, and I guess you already see that this is a huge problem. If you don't play 3-4 hours per day you won't be able to get 50-60k per month, that means you have to play with the standard weapons which are not entirely useless, but you would never beat someone who is on the same skill level as you with a standard weapon while he uses his expensive rifle. This also meant that old players will always have an advantage over new players, because they still have their permanent weapons.   The thing is, you may think that the publisher should have no influence on the content of the game, since they are only publishing, but not making it. Redduck is actually making the game, and they do so for several other regions such as Japan/China/Korea. All of those regions still have permanent weapons. In fact, Aeria denied to have anything to do with the change from permanent to timed weapons, but we actually contacted someone from Redduck who told us that they were against that change, but Aeria insisted.  The next point are hackers. Aeria implemented a new anti cheat engine that doesn't do its job at all. There were times where you would run into a hacker every 2-3 games. I can't tell you how it is in its current state tho, since I haven't played since quite some time.  By the way, Aeria introduced the 'Tiered Spender' where you would get additional rewards depending on how much money you spend on their game. That's a nice concept, but the thing is that many of those additional rewards are permanent weapons, which is another aspect that makes it pay to win. Just to give you an idea on what you have to spend for a permanent weapon: In one of those tiered spenders you would get a permanent weapon starting at 7999 AP(a little more than 60€) and ending at 29999 AP(around 210€).  This is coming from someone who sometimes played this game all day long, played 2 tournaments and even made a few videos, my best montage got around 2k views, my overall best AVA video has around 10k views. If you have LOTS of money and can live with the fact that this game is pay to win then by all means, get it. I've been putting a decent amount of money into this game myself, and I would never do it again. Money still doesn't buy you skill, but it surely gives you an huge advantage. The next thing to consider are the hackers, everytime there are free hacks on a certain site AVA will be unplayable, and you might even get banned despite being a legitimate player (At one point hackers were able to use your name, which earned you lots of reports). And then I wish you good luck with Aerias automated support answers when you try to appeal a ban.  In the end it's up to you, but I can not recommend it in its current state.   *UPDATE*  I still play a round or two every few months, and I was positively surprised when I played yesterday. Permanent guns are back, but they are really expensive and it surely will take you quite some time until you have enough money for a good gun. I think they need to either make the weapons cheaper, or give you the option to try them out for free before you buy them permanently. It now feels a lot like back in the days when I still used to play this game all day long, but it still has a few pay to win elements. You are still not going to be able to beat a good player if you are average and spend a lot of money, but it's harder for beginners to get into the game, because it will take lots of time until you found the right gun, can afford it, and got enough money to buy armor as well. So it's not pay to win in the sense that bad players will defeat good players because they spent money, but good players who already have an advantage over new/bad players will have an even bigger advantage, so expect to have a hard time in the beginning if you plan on playing AVA.   If you are starting out I recommend you check out some guides because there are some things you should know that are not immediately obvious. Here is an (old) thread that's actually meant for players who want to play AVA competitively, but still is relevant and could give you some useful tips:  http://www.aeriagames.com/forums/en/viewtopic.php?t=1885997   Hackers are still around, but it's not as bad as it used to be. It is understandable that they can't prevent hacking, because they can only react to hacks after they have been released for the most part. They surely are doing things to stop hackers before they actually get to do any damage, we have XIGNCODE after all. It's similar to bugs and glitches, if you programming a game or program you are going to try to avoid bugs, but you can't eliminate every single bug before they actually occured. The best you can do is try to prevent them to your best ability, so there will be as few bugs as possible.  So, I still don't recommend this game, altho it got a lot better. AVA is on a good path right now and maybe I will one day be able to recommend it again. I even think I'm going to play it more regularly from now on. Maybe I will give AVA a positive review one day, but today is not that day.",1,0

"* If you want to check out any of the other characters besides the first one you are playing, you had better BACKUP those SaveGames because this game will wipe them because it can NOT track multiple characters.   I believe this is a practice from the 'Commodore 128s with a Hard Drive Days'.   I discovered that the 'new let me check out a rogue/hief character' can only Block OR Run Away.   Weapons can NOT be Drawn, hence they can NOT be swung OR fired.   I wish I had read this review before I had written it.   In answer to your questions: Yes, I checked that first thing.

"Ok, I admit, I played this game back in my childhood on my original Xbox, and had so much fun. Not too long ago I reinstalled it for my computer, but when I did, I HATED it. I couldn't play right. People would one tap me from the side of the map, others will just be an absolute pro with the AWP making life so hard. Theres no mercy for new players, there's no official Valve servers, only the community servers which take away the classic feel. I have probably only joined 2 servers that have none of the stupid annoying Quake sounds. No 'double kill' or 'dominating' just classic CS 1.6. It was aggrovating for me, my favourite childhood game gone to waste, or so I thought. I was just bad at the game. I was scared to do anything. If I pushed in first, I thought I would get destroyed immediately. The guns felt weird and ridiculously inaccurate, the game didn't FEEL right, and anything I tried would ultimately fail. Well, until a couple of weeks ago.   I played violent. I played smart. I played gruesome and unforgiving. Getting 4 man spray downs and one-double tap headshots across the map. I was ruthless, relentless, and I enjoyed it. This game was starting to be fun for me, not as annoying, not as frustrating, only fun, as I always wanted it to be. The thing is I learned not to be scared, the same with CSGO. I played CSGO, sucked at it, played horribly until I just began to not care if I died. That was when I began to play better. CS 1.6 came, and I began to be horrifying. Enemy teams would scream at me, I would laugh and continue, their unfornate moments was fuel to my wrath, until, of course as it always happens, a pro AWPer comes towards me and 420 swagscopes me in the face. Rage quit.  11/10 would get Blazed it again.",0,1

"A great game left to decompose.   As much as I enjoy playing this time to time, there are a few reasons why you shouldn't get into it. That's all up to you to decide however.  First, the good:  1. Fairly adult playerbase, I guess mainly because most are the original players from the day.  2. I haven't played Campaign in many years, in fact since I completed it, about 5 years ago, but I remember it was pretty good. 3. Fastpaced multiplayer action.  4. This game doesn't attempt at stealing all your freetime like some other games do, it's fun, but not addictive. 5. This works on Mac, I am not sure if other CoDs don't, but one of my friends recently bought this because it was Mac compatible.   Now the bad:  1. Hackers. It wasn't always nearly as bad as it is now. I am not sure how it works exactly, but InfinityWards seems to not have updated their anticheat system for a few years now and just about any lobby is permiated with a hacker as a result.  2. Unbalanced weapons. I'd guesstimate that 65% of all players use UMP, which is a clear sign your game isn't very well balanced. Some things like reloading on the Intervention has clearly been artificially slowed down, to balance stats out I guess, but still, it's not pretty and it stands out a country mile.   3. It's bloody expensive! I mean, this is 2015 we are living here and this came out in 2009 and it costs 20 USD, which isn't far off what it was at time of its release, I am thinking 7-10 USD maybe? I know it's CoD and CoDs must be expensive by law, but still... If you are going to have a 6 year old game still available for purchase, maybe make it more appealing by offering it at a lower price?  4. Playerbase is small, as You would expect, you'd have to work out the hours when most people come on, otherwise tough luck getting into a SnD when there's like one lobby hosted in the world.   5. Motherf***ing Kicktool! I am not quite sure where IW's common sense was when they allowed people to use that thing, my guess is that this supposed to let people rid of hackers, well no, usually it's used by a-holes to rid off people they cannot outskill. Very quite dissapointing.   I would pass on buying this if I were you, I am sure there are better options for your 20 USD.",1,0

"Prototype has its ups and downs, but more downs that ups. The main character has some super fun super powers that allow you to do some really crazy things as you fly, jump, or run (horizontally and vertically) through the city.The game also looks pretty good. The story seems really fascinating as well, but that's about where the good ends.   First off, the city gets pretty boring pretty quickly as there is nothing really unique about the city that makes any part of the city look any different from another part. I found myself just following the quest markers on the mini map and not trying to learn the city at all. I never knew where I was unless I pulled up the main map. There are lots of cool powers, but when the fights get going you are so busy running around trying to stay alive and kill that you never really get any time to really bask in the fun of watching a cool ability when it is triggered.   The main negative is that it appears that the controls for the PC port didn't translate properly. The keyboard presses are super sensitive. I've been using this keyboard for a few years and dozens of games, so I am comfortable with it, but I never had such problems with the keyboard in any other game than I did with Prototype. To top it off there was no sweetspot for mouse sensitivity either. Either it took HUGE hand sweeps to turn left and right, with the mouse, or my camera would go sitr crazy at the slightest twitch when trying to adjust the sensitivity. Also y-axis sensitivity was way more sensitive than the x-axis.    As a result, I could barely control my character as I bounced off walls, hitting things, or attacking things except the actual mob I had selected as my target. My character looked cool going bat crap crazy all over the fight zone, but if this game had been real life, the people I was fighting would have thought I was an idiot as they easily gunned me down, which is what happened during game play very often. I eventually got so ultra ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the lack of character control that I finally quit and removed the game from my system. Experiencing the story wasn't enough of a draw to make me spend many frustrating hours getting killed constantly and wander through a boring city. I'll read the story on Wikipedia or something.",1,0

The graphics still are decent to this day (2016) and the music can get you in the mood as your shooting down soldiers. The only bad thing is this series rarely, if ever ges on sale. The price for what you get isn't worth it for single player coming in at little then five (5) hours. It's all preference. The mutlplayer component is there but filled with hackers.

"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the current iteration of Valve’s top-in-class competitive shooter, and the first to be maintained in the very modern way it has been. Learning from its experience with Team Fortress 2, Valve has a miniature economy in CS: GO that revolves entirely around gun decals. Players get a few ‘drops’ a week after matches, which can be a gun decal or a weapon crate – the latter of which cost £1.49 to unlock with a one-use key from the store. Obviously this economy is tailor-made, and so there are extraordinarily rare and mysteriously fantastic-looking gun and knife skins (with prices in the hundreds of pounds), then a large range of other skins tapering down to the common-as-muck variety that trades for pennies.  I don’t pay much attention to the CS: GO economy as a whole, though it’s interesting enough, but it’s important for a non-player to understand that a big chunk of the game’s audience takes it very seriously indeed. In the days after a new Operation launches countless forum threads are launched about the value of the new goods, whether someone should sell this new rare drop they got or hold it for a while, Twitch streams with giveaways and 50 crates being unlocked and so on. You get the picture.    I give such context on CS: GO’s economy because – even though it is a subsidiary part of the game to many including myself – it is the molten core of Operation Vanguard. CS: GO is a regularly-patched game but the major updates come in the form of Operations that introduce new maps and new skins, at the price of around £3 for an access pass – with the nice touch that maps are available to all players regardless, or made so shortly afterwards.  To give an exhaustive history of Operations would be no more useful than a general overview. If you play Counter-Strike then the chances are you play a lot of Counter-Strike. What the Operations do is freshen things up a bit – naturally they don’t disrupt the regular Dust-Mirage-Inferno cycle of competitive play, but you get some unfamiliar environments to tool about in, the chance to score some fancy new weapons, and in the context of a game you play almost daily, £3 a few times a year is chicken feed.  Operation Vanguard is different, and the changes are not for the better. The first problem I have with it is major: the way it’s sold seems to skirt the borderline of deception. To participate in Operation Breakout you bought an ‘All-Access Pass’ for £2.39. To participate in Operation Vanguard I bought an ‘Access Pass’ for £2.39. The difference is obvious side-by-side, but of course when OV popped up in Counter-Strike’s home menu I bought it more or less instantly, thinking this was the same thing.  OV’s selling point is two ‘campaigns,’ a series of missions with three branching paths. The missions are things like ‘Win 16 rounds on map X’ and ‘Kill 20 chickens in Deathmatch mode,’ and completing one bags a pre-determined award – either a weapon crate or a random weapon from a specified collection. So far, so OK. But in fact OV has two more campaigns, both of which cost £1.79 to access – which follow more or less the same pattern.    To be crystal-clear about this, the money is not the problem. I’m happy to pay for Operations, and OV’s combined total of around £6 in the context of the time I put into Counter-Strike is really not an issue. But that switch from ‘All-Access Pass’ to ‘Access Pass (with the right to buy more access)’, just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me right off.  First of all I felt conned. I bought the OV pass in the same way I’d bought all the previous Operation passes, expected it to be the same deal, and realised I’d been fooled by the removal of ‘All.’ Secondly, what the two ‘extra’ purchases offer is basically a re-skinned version of OV’s mission book. But thirdly, and this is the real killer, you’re encouraged to buy them to self-medicate the most egregious, enormous, climactically wrong and frankly offensive design decision in Vanguard.  There are multi-day cooldowns on missions. That’s right Rambo, you may have thought you were buying another set of missions and drops to liven up day-to-day business in CS: GO, but in fact Vanguard is a campaign designed to play out over a set period of time, with the only limiting factor a bald external one: cooldown timers.  Let me set the scene for you. I love Counter-Strike. I saw Vanguard was out on a Thursday, and cleared Friday night. Got in a few beers. Booted it up and bought the pass. I played the first mission, cleared it in about 15 minutes. Chose a second, the killing chickens one, and that was another 15 mins. So around half an hour into my evening of joy I was given a four-day cooldown for the next mission.    You can slice this any way you want, but it’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The sad thing is I get the thought process behind it. Consider: you’re Valve, in charge of a game where players (a) want new content but (b) put in so many hours that they’ll rush through anything almost instantly. For example, mission chains. Operation Breakout introduced missions in the form of random drops, which parcelled them out over time but had no larger arc. It was fine but the missions never felt… important. So Operation Vanguard’s missions are in structured patterns, with defined rewards, and are given the desired longevity through simple brute force of timing. You will not complete this content before we say so, because you can’t.  Oh, except that if you buy the extra mission packs, your cooldowns decrease across the board, because now you’re allowed to do more missions in a set period. That’s right. You’re basically paying to reduce cooldowns. In a Valve game.  The thing is that Operation Vanguard is only a ‘campaign’ in the same way that a pile of biscuits is ‘lunch.’ The missions are basic objectives like ‘Win 16 competitive rounds on Season’ or ‘Get 100 FAMAS kills in Deathmatch mode.’ And what do you get for completing them? Either a drop from an existing collection of guns, with a minor chance of a rare gun, or a weapon crate. The first is fair enough, but the second… I mean, at this point I already felt pretty rinsed by Operation Vanguard, and now it’s ‘rewarding’ me with crates that I need to pay more money to open.    There is a school of thought that says Valve has done this in order that a flood of new crates and mission rewards doesn’t flood the in-game economy, instead trickling them in over the coming months. To that argument the only appropriate response is – who cares? I play Counter-Strike: GO because it’s a great game, I don’t play it because of the economy, and while I accept the latter is how Valve makes money, the moment it starts intruding into the game – if indeed this explanation holds water – then the economy is not acting in the way that it should. That is, it should be improving the experience rather than throttling it.  The sad thing is that Operation Vanguard comes with my favourite selection of community maps yet, including two in Season and Back Alley that feel like potential classics. Yeah they’re all over the place in terms of favouring one side or the other, but this is par for the course with CS: GO and will be tweaked over the coming months. Every CS: GO operation freshens the game up with some new environments if nothing else, and the point of Operation Vanguard’s structure is to elongate this beyond a few days – to really showcase these excellent maps by forcing people to play on them semi-regularly for missions. It at least manages this.  I want to emphasise that I’m an enormous fan and c",1,0

"Initially this was a good game... no really- it was. I Mean who doesn't enjoy dropkicking helicopters to death in a 'free roam' environment. between a massive slew of unlockable powers and movement mechanics, some really stylish animation, and overall addictive gameplay- this game has a lot going for it. However, between a thin story (It could've been a lot better if there was just more character depth) and some maddeningly bad boss fights *cough* elizabeth green *cough* and the abysmel slew of bugs that invariably result in stunlocks and instant death- the latter parts of the game will probably leave you feeling like you should go play contra to unwind. for a game released in 2009 to have so many weird bugs is. well... not so great. Especially from a publishler like activision. Still the bugs arn't so bad as to completely ruin the game. All in all i'd give it a 6 out of 10. The animators did great, the graphics, for the time, are OK. (Would be better if not clearly aimed at consoles) the story and gameplay itself could be a little more solid. Still worth buying if you catch it on sale, but be prepared to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at a couple poorly designed boss fights, the ocassional unavoidable stunlock, enemies running around at mach 12, and the autotargetting system leaving you spinning in circles at 90mph.",1,0

"I used to play this a few years ago and this was a game worth playing. The campaign mode was good, the multiplayer mode was decent and it ran smoothly. I have started playing once more for the past three months and I will admit. I have had enough! The campaign may still be good (although it runs a little slower for me now) but the worst thing about this game is the darn multiplayer.  Allow me to tell you why for this one very good reason in my humble opinion:  It has been hacked to oblivion- I click to play TDM in the game mode selection menu, I wait to be connected to what appears to be a TDM and I somehow land up playing Domination. What makes things worse is that the host can reset the match at the end without allowing you to change up your classes in the after match intervals. This means you go straight back into to domination ON A TDM SERVER CHOICE. This, added with lightning fast quick scopes, grenade launcher addicts, bunny hoppers (people whom jump and shoot/ avoid fire), spawn campers (sitting near enemy respawning places to get easy kills) and the aimbots makes for a very unpleasent gaming experience.   While Treyarch/Activision and ect will have likely to have been furiously working away to conjure a new way to make the public £100 poorer with a sequal to a previous title, they have been forgetting to make sure that their older releases are still being maintained for the enjoyment of hardcore loyalists to the older games that were released. No anti-hack updates or PunkBuster equivilent software has been created to stave away the hackers which suck the joy out of everything.  This may be irrelevant now as no one will be buying this or caring anymore. However I hope the developers are aware that yes, there are still people who play the older games and unfortunately people sad enough to hack them also (probably because they are better than the recent ones i.e Ghosts and Advanced Warfare in my opinion are enormous piles of rubbish trying to keep up with Halo). Getting back to this game, I would not recommend it because of how frustratingly terrible the game has become to even attempt to play. If you want to be hounded by the feinds listed above then go for it, but not for me as I have had my fill and so with that I conclude by saying: consider yourselves warned.",1,0

The same targeting, health gain system and even you have unlockables, and upgrades (not really combos). The NPC characters start to look the same after a while. I was somwhere in the middle of the story or at the first third, when I totally lost my interest. Nor the story, neither the game style couldn't get me back to the game.",1,0

"Let me go on record to say that this game is fun. It has some good gamemodes, some good combat, and overall, it's a very good counter-strike knockoff. then the problems start. First: this game installs a keylogger. THAT'S ♥♥♥♥ING RIGHT. IT INSTALLS A 3RD-PARTY KEYLOGGER FOR ANTI-CHEAT MEASURES. It's also nearly impossible to remove, unless you extremely specifically remove something from System32, then from Regedit, but i'm not even going to try. Second: The company that  made  bought the rights to this game filled it up with weapons that you have to buy for... with real. world. money. Here's the best part: the weapons have better stats, but disappear from your inventory after a while. You know what that means? A Paytowin FPS. Even if they didn't have other stats, they're just retextures of other items, for example, you could have a normal smoke grenade, or get a colored one for an additional fee. Personally, i only installed this to get the black rose in TF2, but found myself playing it more than expected. I uninstalled it several months ago, and just now found out about the keylogger.   DON'T INSTALL THIS GAME. NOT EVEN FOR THE BLACK ROSE. IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK.  ",1,0

"I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that.",1,0

Great visuals and an awesome story (in terms of Call of Duty stories that is) Multiplayer is a huge success and brings hours and hours of enjoyment with the usual prestige system they've got going.  Overall this was one of my more favoured COD experienced.  I'd give this game a 8/10 I'll just urge you all not to bother buying it anymore as the playerbase is basically nothing.",1,0

"Counter-Strike, this one also known as Counter-Strike 1.6, is a team-based multiplayer realistical/military shooter. And a very well known one at that. It was first available as a free mod for Half-Life 1, being patched regulary up to version 1.6, until recently it got it's way onto Steam, as a serapately sold title.  So, how is the player base? Counter-strike 1.6, being popular self, has an active player base. You will see many servers, up to 32 players. At very least there are many Russian servers, as it had a cult following over there, can't really see past them. On bad side, most seems to prefer 'Terrorist plant C4' mode and then De_Dust2 is the most played map. A lot of servers run small mods, that may alter balance or other small things. And most of it, playerbase had a lot of time to play and master this game, so new players will be more frustated than having fun learning.  Counter-Strike is a very well known realistical FPS. It gained it's popularity while being free mod for popular Half-Life, because it provided something else what wasn't overused yet - realistical shootouts (using models of real weapons, you know) in team multiplayer. Unforgiving and furious. Or unbalanced and twitchy one-shot kills with headshots. Whichever one you prefer.   Counter-Strike has two types of map. First, 'de', is a mode where counter-terrorists have do defends few market spots on map from terrorist. One of the terrorists spawns with C4 in inventrory and has to bring it to one of the marked spots to plant it adn start to countdown of T's victory. Roles change as Terrorists will have now to defend this place from CTs, who's aim now are to defuse the bomb, in which case CTs will win the round, no matter how many more Ts are left. Pretty interesting mode and most played, otherwise this game would have been camping fest. And if one site is too well defended, Ts can go to another one. And then there is a second type, 'cs', in which CTs have to to rescue hostages by bringing them back to base. The problem there, is that hostage NPCs aren't perfect (though good enough) and since CTs have to rescue them all, Terrorist can camp in one of the spots around them, since CTs will have no choice but to come to win. Much less played and even if it does, it goes like your everyday Team Deathmatch, just killing all of opposite team. Much simpler anyway.  Now, the core gameplay... There are few rounds. Each round starts with each team spawning on their side of map. There is no respawning during round, once person is dead he is out, so you will have to worry much more about getting insta-killed. There are no items placed on map itself either (on correct, official maps), no kind of medikits. In spawn place, you have 15 seconds to press 'b' button (or whichever you set) to bring up 'buy menu', where you purchase weapons and equipment for the round witht he money that you earned so far. Yep, when round ends everybody gets some sum of money to spend, with winning team getting more, an ingenius design decision that helps losing team to get steamrolled even harder. What you can buy there is a pistol, primary weapon and any of the equipment. (Yep, if it doesn't smell like prototype of modern military shooters) Once past purchase screen, you are free to run and shoot. And here comes the art of recoil and aiming. For you see, one of the more important thing that is used in this game is accuaricy of your weapon. If you move it drops. if you jump, it drops. It drops while you are shooting too. Thus it becomes more importanly to get good position, making assaults more compilated, and you often have to relearn to shoot, making few clicks instead of just holding down mouse button. You will have to be often walking instead of running, to keep accuaricy while moving (it also makes you silent, so do it often), or just stand and crouch sometimes. Burst shooting is better there and for long range targets you want to be just click few times. Another important thing is that you can shoot through some walls with more powerful primary weapons. So don't be surprised for people shooting through door, walls and even just over the corner, it indeed does small damage to whoever is behind. The game also emphasises aiming because it supports headshots and they do a MASSIVE damage. And you also got three kinds of grenades. Explosive (HE), which explodes, good for throwing into chokepoints. Flashbang, which blinds whoever looked at it when it blows for few seconds, quite annoying but good for stroming into room. And Smoke Grenade, when you don't want enemies to see you coming and don't want to be under direct fire, good for open spaces with snipers (who instakill you when you peek around corner). Protip: You run slightly faster with knife out.  And well, while on theory it sounds interesting, as well as empashises teamwork. here comes the downfall of the game. The weapons, while make people with gun fetish happy, are badly balanced around each other. There are just best and bad weapons. From pistols Desert Eagle is the best, they behave as backup when you got no time to reload primary weapon. Shotguns are theorically good for close range but in this game they are useless and Assault Rifles can kill even better at close range. Sub-Machine Guns category had advantage of no accuaricy drops while moving, but are still inferior to Rifles. Rifles category has two best guns: all-range assault rifle like AK-47 and all-range sniper rifle like AWP (which doesn't even require headshot to one-hit kill), exactly what majority of people use. The only Machine Gun is 'pew pew pew can't hit'. And all-range is all-range, random is random. You may run and shoot in general direction of enemy and pull off a headshot from your AK-47 by luck. Or you may walk around corner, thinking of your next grandious tactical plan, just to get headshotted in insta-second by guy with sniper rifle from close range. It's just so full of cheap and frustating, the rage is probably the main thing that keeps players coming back for more, not honest fun, as well as luck of possibly pulling few magical headshots. Slow-down when being hit doesn't seem to be good idea either, making it harder to get away from the choke points. And random spread is not actually random, it just randomly follows one of the pre-set pattern. And yes, if you will learn them, you will be able to control your shooting better and get on top. Exactly what puts apart newbiews and elites, and exactly what elites seem to boast about when they want to say that Counter-Strike 1.6 is the best because it takes more skills and time to learn, with artifical challenges like this one that makes little sense. And well, once you spend your time to learn them, you will still find out on top that it didn't make the game any more amazing.  But you know, it's not too bad. It does teamwork well. Sometimes the game just works. When you work along the team, round the corners and storming the next room, where you follow teammates, supporting each other. Provide covering fire to the corner. When upon entering next place, each one covers his own direction, as some of the rooms just have too many places from which enemies can shoot you (smoke grenade and flashbangs help in these cases). And it's pretty damn nice at those moments, until they get ruined by something stupid, something you don't feel like could be prevented. Yea, getting shot by sniper.  And yes, this game has good enough sounds. No music, sadly. The graphics are quite HL1 high-definition era, but otherwise are fine enough. The levels are a bit of bland though.  Can't really recommend it. Because everybody who will like such games are already playing it. And player base of this game had too much time by now, that they will be just way too skilled for new players, who will just get destroyed and it will take a long time to get onto same level. It's not like there aren't enough military/realistical shooters anyway.",1,0

"I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane.

Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.

Would be difficult to allow mods and add ons since most of kids cheat anyway?  The fact that this game still costs 20 buck is the proof that money is all what they seek.

"Have you ever played an MMORPG and felt, 'oh gosh, I wish there was no once else but me and the NPC's around here'? Then this game is right up your alley. This game is right down to the core an offline MMORPG. You get tons of trash armor, there's something that reminds of dungeons, kill and fetch quests everywhere and as much action in the gameplay as you would expect of an MMORPG. While the overworld have some pretty places to look at, you rarely get much of a chance to do so since you spend most of your time inside somewhere.  Positive: + Combat is responsive when dodging and there's nice hit detection when hitting an enemy + The armor is the game looks good + Overworld is pretty and there's a lot to look at + If you dig deep there's can be some fun character builds  Negative: - Using shields in combat is absolutely unresponive and awful - The amount of trash equipment you get makes it a chore to find anything. You spend more time going through trash than you do comparing which weapon to use - Questing is VERY overwhelming in this game. You get quest, on quest, on quest, on quest. - Questing is completely uninspired. If you've ever played an MMORPG you probably have experience with the kinds of quest you get in this game. - They don't put much effort into getting you interested in the story, which is needed in this game since you get so many story side-quests. Sometimes you end up doing a quest and out nowhere find out it was apparently a huge part to the main story, but unless you're really reading and listening to every single NPC on the way you won't get anything from it. - I played over 10 hours and not a single hint of a mount of any kind. Wouldn't even be a little surprised if at least 5 hours of my gameplay time has been just running from dungeon to dungeon and city to city just to get filled with quests. Some cities only exists to give you quests. - Overworld, while pretty, feels very empty. You get the feeling of playing a dead MMORPG everywhere and it just stops the world from feeling alive at all.  With all of this said, you might find some enjoyment if you really enjoy making original character builds and mess around with that. But if you're anything like me and just enjoy some classic warrior action this game is going to bore you to tears and you're better off with Guild Wars 2, which actually is an MMORPG with an alive world and have fluid combat as well.  Only buy this game if you're starving for some wRPG action.",1,0

"Ok, so Kingdoms of Amalur. After watching the trailer when it was on sale, and looking up some reviews, I decided to buy it. Straight off the bat, I came across my first problem. When the game was done downloading, I counldnt see anything. I can hear the audio just fine, but the visuals didnt show. (and no its not my graphics card, it can easily handle it [Amd A10-5745M Apu with Radeon]) So i deleted it and reinstalled it. It worked so i continued to play. After the turtorial, I agreed with most if not all players that the combat is EXTREMELY FUN. I was somewhat bewildered and happy with this new combat mechanic. But the fun combat cannot cover the other complaints I have. First off, the characters are really boring. Not just the npcs, but your player as well. Though a somewhat interseting backstory, it doesnt grip me enough to play on. Same with the plot. The unintersting story, just doesnt flow well.(Dont worry about spoliers, beacuse i dont even know whats the plot) Maybe its due to the fact that Ive only played the game for 3 hours, and it picks up later on, but if it does, then thats a fail for a rpg. Or any game for that matter. These flaws already is a turn down for me. Fighting makes only half of an rpg, and story and character devlopment as the other(where this game fails to achive). There are a couple of minor flaws, but I think its more of a play style prefernce. So my verdict:5/10. A decent rpg with an extremely fun fighting mechanic, but lacks in essensial rpg elements. If this were a free game, i wouldve cared less, and probably wouldve given it a positive review, but if Im BUYING an rpg game, I EXPECT an rpg game.",1,0

"Advantages: a good idea, an opportunity to play on a network Disadvantages: poor performance, graphics, textures, defects. Collection of my reviews on video games continues. Today we will speak about the most famous first-person shooter 'Counter-Strike'.  Igrushechki this appeared quite a long time, already in the year 2000 and won the gamers. Then all these 'shooters' were a novelty, and of course all like this game. I knew about it a long time, I heard enthusiastic talks about it, heard the word 'bots', 'contra', 'headshot of', 'ks'. And what is it, I managed to learn five or six years ago. Games then I was not 'tempted', but even then I have appreciated this game for three and a minus. Why? I'll explain later. Now the whole of the game. Created her notorious guys with the short name 'Valve'. About 'Valve's' I will say this: all of their games on the subject stopped 'fantasy' and 'half-real.' And this game belongs to the second category.  So, the creators of the idea is quite tempting. Confrontation of the law against terrorists. They gave the game the proud name of 'Counter-Strike', ie 'counter-attack', but that's just shock, as such, no intrigue in this game. And that is? There are running with a gun, a gun, a knife. Oh yes, there is another grenade (use 0). And you can take the shield (not a bad thing). We can play for the 'special forces' (which I did) and terror (very few people want). Most probably the main thing here is that we can play a 'bot' that is, our friends runs the computer, the computer runs our enemies, but we can play and through the network, where all have real people. Play over the Internet more interesting, but still 'stupid'.  I do not want to talk about any reality or fiction, but all I will say. I have not seen, not in movies, not in life, to special forces, and the terrorists jumped as the 'hare', climbed the stairs, as if running on the ground. And finally, it is that even the slightest preparation is absent, the men can not hit no shield, no weapons, no arms / legs. The hostages, but here too there are, behave calmly, stand, no one is afraid of fear or cry.  So, I criticized a little, and now tell you about the features. Game modes are different, rescuing hostages, rescue VIP-a, defusing a bomb, knife, grenade. A quest we give money, we buy ourselves, that it is necessary, for example, body armor (a rare case when it is not worn in advance on fighter (in reality)). On the job, we allocated time, which is usually enough. Each of the men says that he wants and commands that it is possible to give no one is listening. By the way, there you can sprinkle a logo that can be selected in advance. Beauty is not gaining.",0,1

"So i did some research and found that this game crashes if you enable interlacing, which is something that has to do with your gpu and how it streams its data that almost every modern gpu uses by default, which has to be changed in the B.I.O.S. Which makes it confusing how I managed to play about a half an hour of this before it crashed in game, and loading a save only made it crash again during the loading screen, and the community seems to not have a fix for it. Starting a new game also didn't work in case you didn't think I tried. Downvoting until i hear it's fixed, odds are with a game this old now it will never happen. Really fun though, controller pretty much necessary.  Edit: So I looked at this review and realized that I pretty much didn't cover any of the game I actually played, so in short, it has some decent puzzle elements, like stopping a fan blade over a death pit and walking across per say, or walking up to a dude, taking his gun and punching him in the face. You would not believe how much fun that is until you try it. I've played through most of the game on my friends ps3, which is why I picked it up, however I'm still dissapointed that there isn't a solution for my problem no matter how hard I look, considering my BIOS is apparently crap and I don't have interlacing options. This is a good game, and I reccomend picking it up, just not on PC, I hate to say it.",1,0

"Initially this was a good game... no really- it was. I Mean who doesn't enjoy dropkicking helicopters to death in a 'free roam' environment. between a massive slew of unlockable powers and movement mechanics, some really stylish animation, and overall addictive gameplay- this game has a lot going for it. However, between a thin story (It could've been a lot better if there was just more character depth) and some maddeningly bad boss fights *cough* elizabeth green *cough* and the abysmel slew of bugs that invariably result in stunlocks and instant death- the latter parts of the game will probably leave you feeling like you should go play contra to unwind. for a game released in 2009 to have so many weird bugs is. well... not so great. Especially from a publishler like activision. Still the bugs arn't so bad as to completely ruin the game. All in all i'd give it a 6 out of 10. The animators did great, the graphics, for the time, are OK. (Would be better if not clearly aimed at consoles) the story and gameplay itself could be a little more solid. Still worth buying if you catch it on sale, but be prepared to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at a couple poorly designed boss fights, the ocassional unavoidable stunlock, enemies running around at mach 12, and the autotargetting system leaving you spinning in circles at 90mph.",1,0

" ...MmmMy Name Is Alex... Mercer... an  angry-as-f__k  pile of bioplasm in the guise of a man.    I was interested in this game when it was new because ot the amazing opening sequence done by Blur (I am an un-repentant fan of their work) but was ultimately swayed toward the PS3-exclusive Infamous. Having played that game I've decided to give Prototype a shot.  The name couldn't be more apt. Unfortunately for me, having something to compare this game to has compromised a good chunk of my objectivity.  I like the open world aspect, and the visceral feeling of power that Alex has, but I could do without his one-note, 'I'm angry, with a gravely voice', presentation   I don't like that his only interactions with the npcs range from  NYC-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  to  homicidal sociopath .  The game performamce is a little laggy but otherwise problem free, (I am playing on a laptop with middling AMD graphics, as my gaming rig is in storage until get a new place) and it holds up pretty well at 720p The issue I have is with how long it take to switch to and from the... 'genetic memories'(?) Section.  I am not through with game but right it's grade is a c+  Addendum: I am finally at the end this... game and my enjoyment has dwindled as I have gone on... I am at what is I'm guessing is the final boss (after starting the game over on a new machine) and I am struggling to find any reason to continue.

"From my original review, Postal III was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful sequel to Postal 2.  However, let's take it back a few notches.  Postal III is a third person shooter, unlike Postal 2, which was a first person shooter. The game, gameplay wise, is similar to Postal 2. You shoot ♥♥♥♥ and perform tasks. However, Postal III introduces alignment. You can be good, or bad, and depending on your actions, you get different endings. For example, helping cops bust a hippie pot ring aligns you Good. Killing everyone during the bust aligns you Bad. That is a pretty cool feature that makes this game one of the more unique Postal games.  The game makes outside references to the likes of people such as the infamous director Uwe Boll, Gary Coleman from Postal 2, and other such things. It's got the Postal feel, and everything that is there is great, but it doesn't work all the time.  That's really my only main complaint with the game. Due to layoffs and rushes, the game is extremely buggy, and crashes often. The game runs on Valve's Source Engine.  Postal III on the inside has all the mechanics and gameplay aspects to make a good Postal game. However, on the outside, it's a buggy mess that crashes often, has gameplay breaking bugs such as cutscenes not playing, parts of the map unrendering, and other such things.   It's price isn't really warranted, considering it is a buggy crashing mess. If you get it gifted, or buy it out of curiosity, you might be dissapointed, but the game itself is still enjoyable if you can look passed it's flaws.",1,0

"The game is actually good, just not for the price.  I picked this up for three dollars, it came with another game and it was at Dollarama in a physical case. I figured multiplayer on Steam was a thing, since I originally bought a copy for my friend from the same Dollarama and noticed it had steam.  I'm a bit disappointed that it still doesn't exist, same with a lot of features that you'd expect. However, it seems to be ready for multiplayer to be added, as well as the ability to support never-incoming workshop content, since the mods are all really simple reskins.  The game is very simple and fun, and the story is mature, B-movie level garbage, as if Kung Pow: Enter the Fist was directed by Cheech and Chong.   If anyone can find Mr. Healey and get him to mend in workshop and multiplayer or pass the license off to someone willing and capable, it might do a whole hell of a lot better, rather than abandoning it for the PSN version, or even the iTunes comedy doodle version.

"As a diehard fan of the real Postal games, it's very difficult for me to think of any redeeming qualities of Postal III.  Many know this already, but for those who don't, Postal III is not the creation of Running With Scissors. It was licensed to Akella in hopes of developing a next generation Postal game, but thanks to the Russian recession Akella went bankrupt and all developmental work went to a fledgling 'b-team.' The results were catastrophic, as what was once intended to be an open ended and graphically impressive Postal became a bug-ridden mess.   Although its price can never be justified even at 50% off, I will say that for those who already own it, two things about this game are decent. First is the free-roam feature that is unlocked after completing those horrid story missions. If you really can't stand playing through it, which few can, there are ways to bypass the missions that a simple Google search will yield. The free-roam itself is mediocre, as there are few things to do but walk around and slaughter a few civilians until the game crashes, but it's much more rewarding than the series of tutorials that constitute the main game.  The second feature worth mentioning was a joke that occurred... I'd say about halfway through the game, where the Alternative Postal Dude is approaching a building being held up by rather incompetent shooters. In the midst of the inaccurate bullet fest, a peacekeeper attempts to approach the building only to have his head blown off. The Postal Dude then exclaims, 'holy s***, did they level up?' It made me laugh, anyways.  That's really all that's worth experiencing in Postal III. You're much better off paying a fraction of Postal III's price to own the real Postal games.",1,0

"Well.... when it came out, the developers advertised so well, that I choose it over skyrim. After I played the game I regerted my decision. The game is fine, it has refreshing story scent to it. Everything you do feels like a fantasy novel. However, it does not have the open worldness that it advertises, compared to skyrim which you can do much, reckoning's degree of freedom is very limited.",1,0
"In my toddler times I spent a great deal of time playing this. Many sequels have come and gone, but so far I still think of this as one, if not the best version.  However it did not aged well.

So nowadays you're better of following one of the following options:   - Turn around and check TF2; - Turn around and check CS:GO;",1,0

"Tips for noobs:  ~ Skills ~ -Alchemy, lockpicking, persuasion, and stealth are useless skills. -Up to 5 levels of each skill can be found or bought in the game (6 with DLC). -Detect hidden should be invested in immediatly. I've found Purples and Yellows in hidden chests. -Blacksmithing is incredibly OP. -Fateweavers reset all skills. Use this to maximize your training potential (You can be too overleveled in a skill to train it) -Mercantile is excellent for early game. Once you have 2mil+ gold, reallocate those points to something worthwhile.   ~ Combat ~  -Bows with the 7 charged shot ability can one shot bosses when fired at close range.  -Invest early in +health/second gear. This keeps you from overusing health pots.  -Weapon damage stats may be misleading. A Dagger with 30 phys and 30 piercing will read 60 damage. Another dagger with 20 Phys, 20 Piercing and 20 poison/5 seconds will also read as 60 damage. -Use Reckoning often; it's quick to recharge. Combine with experience potions for exponentially more exp.   ~ Misc ~ -Quests are black and white regarding moral choices. These have little repercussions. -You will outlevel the available gear considerably. -Many zones and quests will be skipped. -NEVER repair via a blacksmith. Always use repair kits, it's astronomically cheaper this way (even with 0 Blacksmithing skill) -Explore early. This aids greatly when fast traveling from redundant quest to redundant quest.  -You can buy back EVERYTHING you've ever sold in the game. Only sell to the Fence in Star's Camp. That way you can buyback anything you want (even if you stole it) if you choose to respec.",1,0

"I wish I could rate the online mode some where in the middle because I do have fun from time to time. Unfortunately, I can only recommend a Yes or No. While single player is pretty good, the online experience is extremely tainted with hackers and aimbotters. The worst part is that I do not believe anything is really being done about it. I will admit that I have had fun playing online. But this really only happens if I am able to get enough friends together to start a party. To sum it up, if you plan on playing online, expect this: You will continuously be shot through walls by aimbotters, ruthlessly tracked down by wallhackers, rude players, the occasional dDos from poor sports that can shut your net down for a bit, and you will quickly discover how sexually active your mother actually is (likely within the very first match).",1,0

"While OMD is a very cute game, it suffers from some fairly crippling design flaws. Firstly, most of the levels' difficulty results directly from one decision the devs made; instead of allowing choke-points or open spaces or a single path, the people who made this game decided that each level be bifurcated, but provided portals to allow us to traverse the two. Pick one, devs. Difficulty or ease. As well, barricades are among the most expensive single buildables. In this vein, it is much more economically viable to murder all the monsters yourself, as traps are A) very expensive and B) reset much too slowly. So why, for the love of Atheismo, is there only a 'cash bonus to trap kills' purchaseable!? Why can't we simply rely on weapons? Oh, right-- because the devs decided to split each level in two, so we can't simply use one route or the other. You're forced to use both the (mandatory) crossbow and (shoddy, unreliable) traps. Still, it's a fun romp, even for its faults and flaws.",1,0

"The games dead. Its basically worthless to anyone in USA unless you want to play with third worlders. Even then theres only a few servers it looks like. I would rather die than play with South Americans. Anything south of the US border is just hell ( I have never had a positive experience online with these people and if you know anything about geopolitics I need not go into that), so I advise not dealing with these peoples idiocy and just going with CSGO these days unless you want to LAN this game.  One of the greatest FPS games to ever come out and will forever remain a classic but also a game that can still compete design and gameplay wise with games released in more current times. We will never have the natural form of support from players and ESPORTS ever again. This is before ESports was just a way for devs to market and shill a game. This was from when people who liked to play a game competed and not just a bunch of rich kids trying to win monetary prizes like ESports is now (who else could play CSGO all day erry day in this economy?)  People got behind this game because they liked it, instead CSGO is all about market manipulation and human psychology manipulating with less consideration about gameplay because they want the most monetary return. If the idiots will pay hundreds for a digital knife skin then why would any company invest in gameplay that won't have direct returns like a digital nongood would have?  The video game market is full of idiots who will dump money into anything now just so they can distract themselves from the politcs, economics, and slowly declining living conditions of the western world. Bread and circus in its truest form.  CS 1.6 is from better days, more honest days. When people who wanted to make games, and people who wanted to play games were very closely related and the average IQ of someone who was online was higher than now. These days every idiot has an internet connection. That is to say, the target audience then was just better than the target audiences of todays games. This is exampled many times in economics.

"One will find it is quite easy to encounter persons of highly polished skills in the original version of the Counter-Strike games. This is evidenced by thousands of hours on many of the players records; keep in mind that Steam has not been tracking game hours for a good few years after it first came out with this mod!  I highly suggest one passes by this out of date game, as classic as it may be. I compare an exaggeration of the experience for a new player to that of being anally entered, spontaneously, by barbed nethers. Overwhelming, painful, and a strong sense of defenselessness.  One would do well to instead spend their time playing the latest, 'sexiest' version, anyway. After all, the gameplay is an evolution on the one this game has to offer. I also recommend passing over the current middle-child version: Source.",1,0

"As a diehard fan of the real Postal games, it's very difficult for me to think of any redeeming qualities of Postal III.  Many know this already, but for those who don't, Postal III is not the creation of Running With Scissors. It was licensed to Akella in hopes of developing a next generation Postal game, but thanks to the Russian recession Akella went bankrupt and all developmental work went to a fledgling 'b-team.' The results were catastrophic, as what was once intended to be an open ended and graphically impressive Postal became a bug-ridden mess.   Although its price can never be justified even at 50% off, I will say that for those who already own it, two things about this game are decent. First is the free-roam feature that is unlocked after completing those horrid story missions. If you really can't stand playing through it, which few can, there are ways to bypass the missions that a simple Google search will yield. The free-roam itself is mediocre, as there are few things to do but walk around and slaughter a few civilians until the game crashes, but it's much more rewarding than the series of tutorials that constitute the main game.  The second feature worth mentioning was a joke that occurred... I'd say about halfway through the game, where the Alternative Postal Dude is approaching a building being held up by rather incompetent shooters. In the midst of the inaccurate bullet fest, a peacekeeper attempts to approach the building only to have his head blown off. The Postal Dude then exclaims, 'holy s***, did they level up?' It made me laugh, anyways.  That's really all that's worth experiencing in Postal III. You're much better off paying a fraction of Postal III's price to own the real Postal games.",1,0

"To clarify, the GAME is fun, and I would recommend it. The DLC **DO NOT BUY**. There are a lot of little bugs and glitches, and all of them can be overlooked....except for a few. Which will literally end your time playing on that character. The Dead-Kel expansion was what stopped me. After defeating him, my companion spawned dead next to him, and remained dead when escaping the tunnel where there are 2 cave-ins which the companion gets teleported imbetween before coming to a dead-end beach. The idea is, your companion will be teleported to that spot so they don't get too far behind and will follow you onto the beach where you will be teleported out after speaking with them. Sadly, if your companion is dead, and you don't have multiple save spots, your game simply ends here. If your companion is stuck but alive, there's an exploit you can do which will cause it to get 'un-stuck' and you can hopefully continue with your game.   The game is insanely easy, even on Hard difficulty. Once you get a set-piece with +1hp regen, you'll almost never need to use a potion ever again. It's just sad, that I couldn't play it through just to see the story and was cut short due to a horrible game design. The company is disbanded and won't be patching a fix for it, so I'll save you the time now, and tell you to just keep moving along and find another game. Or don't play any of the DLC's.....or....have a lot of different saves because you'll never know how far back you'll need to restart to compensate for bugs.",1,0
