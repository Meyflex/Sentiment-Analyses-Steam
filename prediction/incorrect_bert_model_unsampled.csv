"Unless there is a good rework of the game and physics, UI, editing mode, story, physics, physics, physics, and physics, the game might as well be kaput, the whole reason to play this game was the work shop and that body of work is what this game was made for. The physics model and neat tricks to exploit it can not be seperated entirely, the technology that the community has developed is impressive and vast. I hope this community of builders keeps making things!",1,0
"i dont think the dlc is that bad. first of all your Diva points will work normally so dont worry about that.
the videos for some songs are indeed,bad. like they look like theyre made by a 5 year old. but most of them do look pretty good. also there are no new miku modules???? i have to costumize miku for like every song kind of a wasted opportunity",0,1
"The difficulty settings in this dlc are off. You better play the Campaign from last mission  to the first mission.
 The first mission is the most difficult and the most annoying mission in total. This is not just because you have only 5 minutes to prepare the defences but also because the finnish superior is nagging you every 2 minutes that soviets have entered your defences and you should get them surrounded and killed. The mission takes about 2 hours to complete that means he reminds you 60 times of what is obivious. Makes me wanna FIN(n)ISH that guy myself!

Other than that, it's a solid package.

[h1]Good things:[/h1] 

It is a simple game where you use cannons to manually shoot enemies and have to build some barricades to extend the road that enemies have to travel to have enough time to shoot them. I like that every few levels there is a new mechanic and new enemy type added as that keeps the game fresh and forces you to learn new tactic to win.

[h1]Bad things:[/h1] 

It is funny that first time you click setting it automatically set all sounds to 0 and also disable the tutorial. Sometimes clicking the GO button just makes your cannons automatically shoot and can destroy an explosive barrel and makes you wait for reload while the wave of enemies is already moving. There were 3 times when the starfish that spawns from killed zombie was just moving and ignoring all obstacles instead of moving using the road that all other not flying enemies use.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1] 

I think this game is like a devolved version of tower defense games. Much more manually shooting than real planing.

Overall score 5.5/10",0,1
"Friend & i were close to being the first to 100% the game but a bug suddenly caused us to no longer be able to search new crates. Meaning we were unable to get the gear to kill the fire demon. Additionally, theres a bug where if you jump too much while you are out of stamina, your energy will not replenish. you can fix this by just attacking with your weapon or using a tool",0,1
"40 min in and just like all the other reviews say don't let the graphics fool you. I think the graphics are fine for the type of game it is. Super addicting and I have only 5 stared the first zone with the first character and it took a few tries. The dice rolling is almost akin to a slot machine and you're trying to hit certain symbols. The difference here is you can customize your dice from the store and make cool builds.

"I like educational games but [i]Pelagos[/i] is not something I expected to see (or sea, to use a pun, which pelagos means anyway as it is a Greek word). The video on the store page showcases an underwater level with lots of species we can look at and - as per the description - we can photograph.

This is all fine but, unfortunately, the relaxing music is not present in the actual game, at all. Movement is also automatic which means you cannot really have an immersive experience and within a couple of minutes the level simply ends. And this movement is what makes you believe the fishes move - they are, in fact, not but all of them are in a still position.

But what exactly can you photograph? Well, shrimps, eels, fishes and even sea horses. Taking a photo is only possible when the crosshair appears (the description of the gameplay in the settings menu wrongly states ""crossheir"" - there is not much text available; I don't like when devs skip proofreading) but it is not explained that the right mouse button will need to be pressed for this.

Also, why are there numbers appearing next to the names? Sea horse 3: does it mean there are 3 different species to be found and I have just found number 3? When all this ended I went to the gallery to see the photos taken but the game abruptly crashed. Verifying the game files and rebooting my PC did not help.

Do we see the photos only? Or is there a description as to what, for instance, the Garibaldi fish is like? It would also be good to know what the ""Kelp Forest"" is - this is the only level we can pick while the others are ""coming soon"". Not recommended until it is fixed or expanded upon.",1,0

"Early access, but already playbale with some fun fights.",0,1
"I do like the game, especially the direct PVP aspect where two teams of five directly fight over the last objective. Engagements can be very chaotic at the final moments due to the overwhelming amounts of dinosaurs, on top of enemy player attacks (sometimes it's even hilarious). Outsmarting opponents in those situations with reflexes, tactics, and teamwork is thrilling and satisfying, and achieving victory with an MVP title is ultimately the best reward in any team-games, including Exoprimal.

Exosuit actions are both smooth, flashy, on-point, and adequate. The developers successfully built unique personalities for 10 exosuits with only their moveset. If you played Warframe before, you can expect the more refined feeling of it in Exoprimal. If you never did, your actions are much lighter and faster than you'd think; they are not mechs nor tanks. Sci-fi aesthetics are also great, I'm a big fan of any good sci-fi world design. 

On the technical side, server connections are stable. I experienced 100ms+ lag during two matches, but other than that I had no noticeable issues. Optimization seems solid, no noticeable frame drops even at the most demanding combat sections. I do own a RTX 3080 and Ryzen 5600x so the game should run well, but since I've become a little skeptical of the recent AAA game launches, Exoprimal did surprise me.
So what I want to convey here, is that the development team has put effort and love to Exoprimal.

But since the Steam asks, ""Do you recommend this game?"", unfortunately I have to say ""No"" to that. I don't think that the Open Beta does not appeal to both the PVP and the PVE audience. 

As for the PVE component, your approach to the gameplay is neither diverse nor deep. It's shoot-to-kill.
One may argue that every PVE co-op shooter can be summarized into shoot-to-kill. However, other co-op shooters offer build customization so that each player can gear toward specialized tactics to effectively deal with certain enemies, and rely on teammates to defend against other threats. Exoprimal has no builds to speak of.
There are some enemy attributes that a player can exploit to gain an advantage, but the problem I see is that you keep repeating it over 75% of the match without the satisfaction coming from ""I am achieving this thanks to my theory-crafting (or my strategic planning)"". 
I enjoy playing as Roadblock the Tank, so here is how I play the game:

[list]
    [*]I toggle Taunt on, lean against a wall, and wait until my teamamates kill all dinosaurs.
    [*]If a dinosaur that can interrupt my Taunt spawns, I turn on Reinhardt Barrier instead, weave in some attacks, and wait until my teamamates kill all dinosaurs.
[/list]

Although I like protecting my teammates, it's hard for me to deny that what I do is repetitive. It's repetitive because there is nothing I can do to change up the gameplay. Battleborn featured gear customization and a skill-tree for both pre-matches and in-matches to promote experimentation and break tedium, but Exoprimal (or at least the Open Beta right now) does not.

This was why I said that the direct PVP combat was fun, because I know the situation will be different when facing off against human players. Despite the good direction and display, PVE encounters felt indifferent, even when swapping exosuits in a class. 
If you do want to experience something different then you will need to swap classes, but players in general don't prefer Tanks and Supports because they are regarded as ""boring"", ""passive"", and ""not flashy"" in a horde or a PVP game. And even if they do try them out, they will probably end up getting bored again (due to lack of builds and customizations - ""depth"").


As for the PVP aspect, again, only the direct engagements against human players were interesting. I assume that the designers wanted players to build team-cohesion first by introducing PVE and utilizing that as an asynchronous PVP challenge. I usually see this kind of gameplay in a mobile game, not a PC game, and I think that this is what the developers missed - people who own a gaming PC or a console are core gamers. 
Core gamers either prefer to directly compete against other players to feel superiority, or cooperate with others without getting stressed out from heated competitions. Core gamers tend not to like games that try to mix to two different genre. 
The two exceptions I know of are Sanctum series and Escape from Tarkov. But Sanctum still stays within boundaries of PVE shooter, and in Tarkov, players can choose to be stealthy and disengage to prioritize safety over loot. But in this Open Beta, there's nowhere to hide from repetitive AI-killing or human enemies.

Combat legibility and communication are poor in direct PVP combat. It can be difficult to tell what is going on at times due to sheer amounts of dinosaurs present on the last section. Each exosuit has a voiceline for when using an Ultimate, but I cannot tell if an ally or an enemy used it until I get hit. 
Ping system is decent enough, but they are inconspicuous. Pings players placed need to be bigger, more highlighted, and display target portrait so I can tell what info is being relayed by just looking at it. Pings should also be marked on the minimap. 
Dinosaurs block line-of-sight when attempting to ping enemy players which I find annoying. Enemy players should take top priority when targeting a ping. 'Enemy exosuit!' ping also has a bug where is removed shortly after pinging an enemy.
And I do not understand why pings and emotes share the same radial menu. They need to be separate. 

The balance between exosuits and classes feels decent, but there are some outliers. I believe that a good Zephyr - an aglie melee attacker - can really stomp the opposition thanks to his potent crowd-control for being an Assault. Skywave, a Support exosuit, probably has too much utility and evasiveness compared to other Supports. Vigilant is a sniper Assault and is seen every match. I find that she can do damage too easily when Deadeye has to constantly track enemy movement while also considering bullet velocity, and Barrage is unreliable in general.


So if you are wondering my final verdict based on this Open beta, it's ""good for me, probably not for the general audience"". They put effort to this game, it's by no means a half-assed game. But they should have presented two gamemodes for pure PVP and PVE players to leave a good first impression. Alternatively, they should have decided to entirely focus on a single genre during pre-production instead, but I'm afraid that they are way past that point.
I wrote this review as if I'm a PVP-oriented player but actually I play both, especially leaning towards PVE. So I'm expecting a prettier, better version of EDF as everyone is asking on the Steam forum. 

And finally, to whoever is the final decision maker - please consider making Exoprimal free-to-play, or at least lowering the price by two-thirds. I realize that's cutting a lot, but multiplayer games thrive on playerbase. If you put a massive paywall in front of potential buyers (especially with a new IP), it will be very difficult for the game to sustain its population. Exoprimal is also implying that there will be a season pass, which will make the overall price too expensive. Only famous games such as Diablo or Monster Hunter series can get away with this, since gamers know that those IPs can be trusted.

"I am a little torn on this review...I enjoyed the modeling, but whoever translated the story into English is not a native speaker of English by no means and its very poor in that some times not making a lot of sense. In premise the story is ok, but the translation is like fingernails on a chalkboard. This is what ruined this for me. The story could also be longer, to many opportunities were wasted that could have let to more scenes and plots that where obvious. It needs a lot more work to be good.

*Edited Version* I went and installed the Fan Mod by HarryMason which greatly improved the enjoyment of this short game, no more ""fingernails down a chalkboard"" cringe factor because of the poor english translation.  There is still plenty of issues with this game with way to many missed opportunities and paths that *Could* be included to make this a longer, better game. I now gave it a thumbs up WITH the FanMod. If you do not install this, its still a thumbs down.",0,1

"If you like slot based games you will love this... eventually.  The game itself has an ENOURMOUS amount of depth, content and additional concepts from similar games.  However, most of that content is unveiled slowly as you complete missions on the map.  And a lot of it is not really that well explained.
Pros :  
- Solid slots play reminiscant of other popular games
- Totally unique symbol mechanics, item mechanics, meta mechanics and more
-  Something like 20 full SETS of symbols each with their own gameplay mechanics and synergies
-  Meta progression 
Cons :
-  The graphics are a little mobile feeling ( some of the later sets are a bit stronger in graphics but still)
-  The slow release of content can feel a bit TOO slow for some people, making them not really get into the game and give up before they ever see most of what makes it good
-  Meta progression
-  Bad translations/descriptions.  I don't acutally know if this is based on translation or just poor wording but many of the abilities and item functions are hard to immediately understand, you actually have to use it and see what it does.  Similarly they call the symbols chess peices which makes no sense whatsoever as the game has no connection to chess.

You'll notice meta is both a pro and a con, it really depends on preference.  Unlike a lot of these games this is actually meant to make you feel a bit... stronger... as you progress, with more options and more abilities and less junk.

So i would STRONGLY recommend this game, but if you play it you really need to get through the first few maps before you will see what the game is really like.  If you are the type that likes to test and refund if you don't like, maybe check out a later game play video somewhere first.
This is a VERY good game that does a VERY bad job of selling itself.  It starts too slow , isn't very appealing to look at , and explains itself poorly.  But if you can get through the first couple hours and start unlocking the depth it is amazing.

"This is an okay remake, but it's budget is too low and it really shows. Didn't experience any major bugs, and it looks [i]fine[/i], but I wish it had been better. The physics are also too slow. The small delay every time you butt-bounce really frustrates me, it's pac-man's signature move and it used to be so snappy. This game also makes me really miss the flip kick from world 2 which allows you to cancel your upwards momentum, so you can land faster and thus platform faster. Really this just made me want to play world 2 because that game feels so much better and more responsive.

I like this and want to finish it. But please, if you remake world 2, don't touch the physics at all (except for the ledge climbing on platforms moving away from you which makes it impossible to climb up them), and put more time, effort, and money into fleshing out the graphics and the world.",0,1
"Great dlc, very similar to the base game.
I see a lot of people complaining about the wrong things, such as base game permanent upgrades not working well with the new cave types. The caves are harder and have different layouts because it adds new content, and it also forces players to come up with new ways using the new equipment available to them in order to solve the roadblock. The new permanent upgrades are grindy yes, but they are also almost completely useless (except for the Emergency Safe and Core Beam). If you looked at the upgrades and thought to grind them out, then that's your mistake.
Instead, exactly like it was in the base game, there are a few things that you must hyperfocus on in order to thrive. Can't destroy the new caves? Try the Heavy Exosuit or the Seismic Suit anomalies. These both turn the caves to absolute dust, even at the very top. Having trouble defeating the enemies? Just like the Laser Gun in the base game, use the Locust Machine gun. 
This dlc is not hard, just slightly grindy. The main problem with this entire game is having a few really good anomalies and weapons, but leaving the rest as filler. The runs are boring because instead of figuring out a new strategy based on what you have, you just gotta pray you get a good item. A few small issues like audio bugs and accidentally starting the Zeus boss fight which restarts your run :(
Overall, very similar to the base game imo, and for less than $5 you can get a good 10 hours of gameplay if you want to 100%.",0,1

"I recommend this DLC to anyone who has any intrest in game design as I have never before seen a dev actively make their game worse by releasing DLC for it. It's like they deliberatly expanded on the worst aspects of the base game and introduced other design flaws alongside it.

It's a bore to get through and even the new boss fights feel tedious, the devs seem to agree as they made an upgrade that let's you skip one of them completly. The mining is completly braindead and takes forever, the new materials are so rare, that the only reason to find them is that old weapons and upgrades are made useless by powercreep. Each enemy wave takes forever now and taking damage is unaviodable. 

The ""story"" is not worth thinking about: There are other humans, they wanna kill you. There are more monsters, they wanna kill you too.

Devs just focused on making the game hard without making it enjoyable. The best comparison I arrive at is Dark Souls 2, except Dark Souls 2 at least had some good ideas that added to the franchise overall.

"SCS Software: New truck? It's free content and it will be available within the in-game truck dealers as free dlc. 


Nils Jakrins: New vehicle available but you must purchase because we need money.


Update: It seems I've been called out on their Discord. I don't think people understand why it's hard to focus more on fixes instead of creating vehicle DLCs to be bought for like 3 bucks. This game shouldn't be doing paid DLCs right now and I'm still in shock to why it left Early Access, when it [b]STILL[/b] feels like a game that is in Early Access. 

Do you want to know why SCS Software is respectable? Because they're not greedy, they're not toxic, and I'll be glad to buy their expansions because they always bring quality to the table and of course they're not scummy enough to charge any licensed vehicle for just mere 3 bucks. Even if SCS Software has DLCs with the same price tag, they deserve the support they get. Look at their devblogs versus what Flashing Lights has done in terms of content. I've gotten bored of FL to point I decided to just redownload LSPDFR. Hey you want a new Dodge Charger to add your police fleet? Head on over to LSPDFR's website. Do you want more callouts? Go to the LSPDFR website. Hell, do you want to replace your audio like sirens and gun sounds? Head to the LSPDFR website.

My anguish, conversely, spans decades, and runs through my blood from the uttermost depths of my being. I have sworn fealty to the realm of Dransik since the beginning. Twenty years I served, languishing beneath swarms of bats and the molestations of giant spiders in search of higher purpose. Never before had pixels so bestirred my heart. Here were forged the most enduring and meaninful friendships of my life. And even in this unforgiving land of magma and impenetrable woodland teeming with carnivorous squirrels, betimes love did blossom, and my paramours and I gambolled about the meadows, petting sheep and smelling what were, if one squinted, most likely flowers. 

A life without Dransik was not one I could bear to contemplate. Alas, entropy is but one of many symptoms of the disease we name life, and sooner or later, the greatest of humanity's works all fall prey to rot. What exists on Steam today is merely a shadow of Dransik's former splendour. Gone are the early morning 200 player orgies, gone are the seal parades, gone is the thriving economy fuelled by the slave labour of hapless new players. It is a husk, a barren shell, an ensemble of bones dancing on puppet strings held by the careless and incompetent. 

Abandon all hope ye who enter here. Dransik is dead. Joy is dead. And soon I shall follow suit.",1,0

"First-person shooter we used to find on demo CDs 30 years ago.

The graphics are extremely washed. Everything has the least amount of texture possible, and there are very little details. It somehow suits the time period it's attempting to imitate. The map is a vast foggy and snowy landscape filled with deserted streets, forests, houses, and other things. It's almost like a ghost town.

There are some funny guys living in the area who are attempting to make friends with you. They're simple to recognize because their bright blue clothes shine out against the wintry background. Since ammo is limited, you must keep a look out for supply boxes, which also include food, beer, and a medkit, all of which are needed to regain health. 

When you initially start, supplies appear to be scarce, yet you soon discover an abundance of them. This is because you will eventually infiltrate a military camp with spongy adversaries. Nobody has a gun, so you can at least run away from them. 

If you're lucky enough to get there. There is an objective tab, however mine kept telling me to collect ammo. Instead, I was supposed to find a bomb in a burning building. I stumbled upon it by pure luck after wandering around, not knowing what to do. There is a limit because the map is surrounded by radiation that slowly deteriorates your health.

The game is very short once you know what to do. Compared to copy-paste asset flips, this one at least tries to be original. It's ok for one silly game, but you'll delete it right after.",0,1

"I just don't get it. To go from body horror, psychological horror, survival, combat, beautiful sound, and art design to this? In my mind its completely unthinkable, but if the devs were mad enough to make darkwood, they are also mad enough to make this.

 I understand that acid wizard is a passionate developer that lets pasion guide what they do, and probably feels very nostalgic about being a youth and playing pickup and gym soccer, even if they didn't play it (or were bad at it). The artwork and world of the game seem to have as much love in them as darkwood, but that doesn't make me understand the situation anymore. Acid Wizard seems like they kinda just do things however the **** they want, and that was clear in darkwood  (and their 5 year break from being a studio). 

Just be aware this game was not made for Darkwood fans, it's simply what the devs FELT like making. refer back to me saying they do whatever TF they want lol. If it wasn't already completely apparent that they don't care about making money, holding a steady fanbase, or having a ""style"", this is proof. 

This game couldn't be more different than darkwood unless it changed it's camera perspective. For me (a person who despises sports games let alone something that makes sports go by even SLOWER) it was an absolute turnoff. But i see the love that Acid Wizard put into the game in the short amount of time it took me to understand I would NOT like this game. 

TLDR: Don't play this if you're a darkwood fan looking for something made by the same devs, im honestly surprised the same people could make these two games. Play this game if you like passionate game design and are a fan of sports in a tactical sense. not for me, but could be great for you. 

I wish there was a neutral recommendation, since I think this game would be fun for many people, but for myself its the polar opposite of what i want to be playing.",0,1
"Pros : Can now take navies; Can now embargo countries I don't like/plan to go to war with to cripple their economy; The Aircraft Designer which lets me make whatever aircraft I need for a certain situation (for example playing a minor nation, a cheap multirole is better than making a fighter and CAS)

Cons : Can no longer make a puppet in a peace deal and give that puppet land in the same peace deal; Airwing changes, I hate the airwings now so much the fact that I can only have 100 planes per airwing is just so annoying especially when you want lets say 2000 planes bombing berlin or 1000 CAS over the maginot line, now instead of making 1 airwing of 1000 or 2000 planes you have to make 10 airwing or 20 airwings of 100 planes and then make sure they are all doing what you want them to be doing. 

Conclusion : would I recommend this dlc, yes, is it because I like the dlc? no, is it because I think the dlc adds features that should come with the base-game not in a dlc half the price of the game, yes, while the by blood alone DLC is overall kinda crap it adds features that make the game more enjoyable, and with new focus trees now there is even more to do, and while yes the airwing size restriction which is forced at 100 so if you wanted anything smaller than that to conserve manpower you can't, and with the changes to the peace deal system making it so I can't for example puppet a minor nation and give it tons of land to serve as a resource puppet while it also having no focus tree that could harm me further down the line, is annoying the other things by blood alone offers makes it not a dlc I want but a dlc that I need.

TLDR : DLC is kinda crap but is sorta worth it but only if you play the game a lot or want to play the game in the future.

"Highly Recommended.

Zi Xao - the Owl guy - is a pretty poor choice for the game. While he has the potential to be very powerful as a damage dealer, he is also incredibly inconsistent and relies heavily on chance scrolls to supplement his poor vitality. You cant CONTROL how his power works, it's very much a gamble. After hours of gameplay, I still don't know exactly how it works - it's very poorly communicated and gameplay aspects are not obvious.

Weapons - The weapons add a good variety for the game. It's amazing that a relatively small studio can create more weapon assets and mechanics than most AAA guys.Wolf Gaze is a particularly helpful weapon in less versatile builds.

But there's one reason why you [i][b]ABSOLUTELY[/b][/i]should get this DLC:
[h3]Nona[/h3]

Iron Wing and Nona's rocket completely break the game. It's easy mode. Getting into a lobby where multiple people have upgraded Iron Wings can stomp even the most challenging foes.
When played in a group - we had a lot of difficulty facing the more difficult foes, but then we switched to Nona and it was a cakewalk.
She's fun, addictive, a great way to grind, and can boost even the most inefficient players.

Nona is [i]Gunfire Reborn[/i]'s easy mode.

"Honestly I do not know how to feel about this. In my review of overall game when I bought it in may, 2023 I complained of lack of the late medieval technology such as arquebus or bombards. Now I am found dumbfounded, beacuse there was no overall information about this in may 2023. Which makes me kind of happy that they added gunpowder ranged units how ever seeing them lock behind DLC makes it weird in my opinion that somehow in the overall medieval fantasy what it was supposed to be the period, I thought but the new culture seems kind of 17-18th century with touch of steampunk. The armors/outfits of the said culture remind me that of Dreadnought from Age of Wonders 3. The Reavers we could say are remnants of lost era or pioneers of upcoming new age? Magelocks seem to interesting concept although I do not know the explaination behind their rifles and cannons are they using gunpowder and ignite it with fire magic or the entire rifles and cannons are fueled by magic too and all of this in order in a way to stabilize the said magic trajectory. I have thought on this and it would be interesting to see an explaination. Considering that gunpowder rifle such as musket works when firing the flint strikes the frizzen and shaves off iron to create sparks. The hammer's blow also snaps the frizzen back to expose the gunpowder in the pan. The pan's gunpowder ignites, and it flashes through a small hole in the side of the barrel to ignite the gunpowder inside the barrel. Considering the compostition of gunpowder (75% potassium nitrate, 15% softwood charcoal, and 10% sulfur) about the composition, certain society trait comes to mind ""Ruthless Raiders"" if there were resources, you could if you want something inhumane for that trait consider them making bone charcoal out of bones of their fallen enemies. Anyways that aside overall the new Culture is great, also given the chance of talented people that are the modders you could create new cultures that use magelocks to make the game Fantasy 17th century 4X Strategy Game.  The new form is somewhat unique I would say are the Bird Anthropomorphic species?

POSITIVES:
- Magelocks
- Siege Engines that use magelock tech
- Apparel reminiscent of the Age of Wonders 3
- New Quests


NEGATIVES:
- No Magelock Naval units
- Seem kind of out of place and time
- Bird Form ( just beacuse bird shat on my friend's head, and ate my hidden cookies on my balcony)
- Price of the DLC
- Content feels limited compared to that was made for Age of Wonders 3 for example Golden Realms
- Culture seems like it is lacking something in it
- unbalanced compared to others  (when I played)


Overall Score: 4.3/10

Unbalanced Industrial Culture with birds for some reason, lacking content which is a shame. I recommend it, but still buy it at a sale or from third-party seller rather than buying it here at full price.",0,1

One the one hand its up the the same high quality standard to the rest of the game and delivers more of the same. 

However it feels more like it should have been free DLC / a lot cheaper. It doesn't add 1-3 hours, more like 1.5 hours as collecting everything isn't hard and was a lot quicker than all the other islands. It feels like it should have added more overall and really is a self-contained section with an interesting reward, but not worth an extra £6 worth.",0,1

"The games name ""Hockey Shooter VR"" pretty much sums up what type of game this is. It is a pretty basic Hockey shooting game with 4 main game modes. There is ""free-mode"" in which you can skate around and take shots at goal, target mode (hitting target), obstacle mode (avoid barriers and get goals) and long range mode (score goals at long range). There is no real effort here to make this any different than the countless other hockey shooting games out there. There is one arena, arcade-style controls and a small amount of fun to be had here. If you ask me 'VR Hockey League' is still the PC-VR hockey game to beat, but if this game was a lot cheaper I might have still given it the thumbs up.",1,0

"As much I really like when Gunfire drops a new content to mess with it for couple more hours. I like and hate this DLC 

You gain 2 new Heroes, Owl and Raccoon also 4 new weapons for a really low price like in previous DLC. 
BUT
Like in DLC1 most of the weapons are f*cking dogsh*t :
- Brick is a really powerful weapon in the Sniper category being one of the best early game weapon for all characters and mid-endgame weapon for Lei Luo (Tiger) 

- Jet Octopus it's another Injector that you would skip/sell every single time you see it. I like the idea by tickling enemies and using Alt-Fire to do massive damage BUT meter that you need to full in for that ALT-Fire takes too long and takes your ammo by making you pretty much useless on the field 

- Wolf Gaze we finally got a new SMG since Scalpel was added 2 years ago. Shortly another cool looking automatic weapon that really really suck d*ck

- Star Ring f*cking sucks and it's really clunky to use 

Heroes :
- Zi Xiao (Owl) by just messing around a little bit looks like a really cool endgame character but the amount of the really stupid information really hurts your brain and you don't even know what you're doing. As the early-midgame 3-5/10 as the lategame 7-8/10

-Nona (Raccoon) really fun character to play a bit squishy, but the thing that you can build around the Robot making him you're Meat Shield and some sort main DPS source is really fun and feels fresh 

Free stuff and update :
As usual they added tons of the cool scrolls for free, little changes to some gemini's and inscriptions.
No buffs for weapons that scream ""BUFF ME"", I'm looking at you SMG and Assault Rifle category
In DLC1 characters were ok but new weapons are a lackluster. 

Otherwise for that really low pricetag you can still spend more time in the game mess around with the new stuff

"Not enough, lmao.",0,1
"First of: the time I have in the game is not accurate. I've played it completely through on my phone multiple times, which of course doesn't show up on Steam.

Now to the actual review:
Hm. This is a bit complicated. On the one hand, I definitely enjoy the story and the characters. The writing is good and I don't really have any complaints. Just based on that, I would definitely recommend this game.

However, the technical aspects are very unpolished.
I'll try to keep the examples spoiler free but no promises.
Choices that you have already made don't consistently get grayed out. [strike]At the party you can keep repeating the scenes with the different groups despite having seen them already. This lead to me seeing the bathroom scene with the girls twice.[/strike] [b]Edit:[/b] This particular example has been fixed. The issue itself remains at other points however.
Occasionally you get multiple reactions to one choice that clearly are responses to all available choices. Samantha at one point answers first to my initial choice and then on the same page says something completely unrelated which seems to correlate to the second and third choice options. [b]Edit:[/b] I haven't encountered this on my last playthrough. Might be fixed.
Sometimes you just skip to an unconnected scene (which is very clearly not on purpose because usually there are transition segments).  [b]Edit:[/b] I haven't encountered this on my last playthrough. Might be fixed.
There are also continuity errors. I picked the man as my spouse but after he received a certain call, the woman showed up, [strike]repeated the information as if she was revealing it for the first time[/strike] and stated that I was married to her. [b]Edit:[/b] the information repeat was fixed, the marriage error remains as of now.
Generally  I'd recommend going through dialogue options in order since they're often nonsensical otherwise and contain information you do not have yet.
Occasionally there also formatting errors, like the markup tags for italics showing up and the text then not being formatted properly anymore.
Something that really annoys me and a spoiler for the end of the game: [spoiler]Every ending I have reached so far described either my spouse, Michael or both as dead even if they were never killed and later showed up alive in the epilogue.[/spoiler]

So, overall, I'd tentatively recommend it, hoping the game gets updated with some fixes soon. Compared to some other games like this it's quite short but the choices don't feel nearly as frustrating and constraining as in some games. I hope it gets improved on and I'll be able to recommend it without hesitation.
Edit: clearly, this game is getting some fixes. I hope someone actually goes through it again and it improves further.",0,1

"[i] My Experience [/i]

I enjoy trying these little student-made games, especially when they are in a genre like Stealth that I have a lot of fondness for. I found the story of the game to be pretty creative, and it was a lot more involved than it really needed to be. I probably still would've tried the game even if Jean were stealing from this mafia for no particular reason.

Unfortunately, one of the core mechanics in the game worked inconsistently for me and really detracted from my experience. In brighter areas, Jean needs to teleport into these small, circular shadows beneath patrolling criminals. Many times as I was playing, the game would either not recognize these small shadows as areas that I could teleport into or the teleport wouldn't ""take"" and I would remain where I was in the room. Each time this occurred, I would lose a little bit of patience with the game.

I did finish, despite this teleportation problem, but I couldn't recommend Shadow Burglar to any potential players until the aforementioned issue is remedied.",1,0

"Minus the bugs and server issues which seem to be improving as the weeks goes by. I love supporting New World but I want to start off by saying mounts should be free for everyone, that's just my personal opinion. The introduction of increased level cap to 65 + enemy AI against the new gear overhaul for PvE makes PvE way too easy and I hope in the future they will introduce harder enemies to fight along with tougher enemy mechanics to go against. The Mutated Expedition overhaul is lovely but before Rise of the Angry Earth update, Mutations were accessed to all players in the base game but because of this change people who don't own the expansion won't be able to go into Mutations ever unless they make this purchase.",1,0

"For someone familiar with the 2 main games before it, and the few ""official"" joke games put out by the developers, it originally felt like it was shooting for a mix of backstage episode with the doujinshi joke works of the past, which sure, April Fools release, what else do you expect.

But considering it leans in on telling a serious story about as much if not more than it tries to fool around, frontloading the jokes seems like it was a bad call, especially when it doesn't do that much fun with the format.
It might have benefitted from even more fooling around and delivering a serious story in the manner of an off hand whimsy like it is no big deal.

Another point against the frontloaded jokes being that the entire thing was too linear, sure the serious story could have been as is, but there were absolutely no choices to fool around in the joke RPG part, which is something that even Requiem for Innocence had in the bit where it was fooling around [spoiler]trying to appear to be a dating sim[/spoiler].
The whole RPG part had so much potential for cracking meta jokes and non canon stupid endings [spoiler]like J.B. min/maxing so hard the game breaks[/spoiler]

From a technical standpoint it has a few typos and misc localization errors. But what annoyed me more is the fact they used the new text presentation format not only for the IRC logs part(which it fits nicely) but also the few flashback dialogues and the epilogue. Do I even need to point out that a wall of text that isn't color coded or have a handle to determine who is speaking at which paragraph or have brackets for thoughts is a bad idea?

Overall the story had more room to spread its wings compared to a Requiem for Innocence which was heavily chained down by being a prequel without much room to pull out crazy developments because it would break continuity.
But it was too linear, missed a chapter of fluff where the very late joining character could get used to the setting in a natural way as opposed to feeling too on board with the situation and ""script reading"" [spoiler]Maria who speaks like knowing too much and a bit too forward, even if you take into account her further plot development.[/spoiler]
But then it also spent a good chunk of time with needless flowery language just to describe something as ""incomprehensible and ineffable"". I'd rather suspend my disbelief on the characters going along with it in 2 sentences, than having it to use text space that could have given the script reader a bit of extra time to feel less like one.

Either way, I still found it pretty good, but it is still in the shadow of how amazing The House in Fata Morgana was. But since it was not restrained to being a prequel or a sequel, it had more moments than A Requiem for Innocence.

Oh and how could you hate on it if it has the incredible fan favorite character that only appeared in one side story and one of those joke games, have a lot of screen time in Seventh Lair?",0,1

If that's anything like what you're hoping a re-release of these games is (lots of improvements to make it more appealing to today's gamer), you're going to be disappointed.  It is a classic D&D game from a long time wayback.  DOS interface, very slow everything.  Old school graphics.  Minimal animation.  Minimal character interaction.  Fight monsters, take their treasure, sell it, and gain levels as you go through the story such as it is.

All that said, these games got me into CRPGs.  They were my first foray into it and I was hooked.  These are those classic games. It's a nostalgia trip and that's good enough for me.

"[h1] Very Fun Game With Trash UI [/h1]
I'm going to get the bad stuff out of the way first.
1. The character model is a bit off putting
[b]2. The UI is really really bad.[/b] I open up the game menu for the first time and I'm taken back to the one time I tried to learn Unity and went through a youtube tutorial. I understand that when games are made, some corners need to be cut but this is glaringly bad. I don't know if this studio is a two man shop or something but come on. For how great the rest of the game is, you would think that someone would actually put in more than one afternoon making a grainy light green color scheme that tries to look cool with the odd shapes but just ends up looking cheap.

Now to the Positives
It takes a bit of patience to figure out all the odds and ends after the tutorial. However, after you get over that short hump, it's a really good time.
I typically don't like farming games but HA keeps me engaged with an ongoing plot and an engaging crafting system that is intuitive but also doesn't hold your had. I like messing around with reciipies and building off of them to create tastier food in real life and this game does a good job of emulating that experience without being tedious.
If you're looking for something chill with a bit of mystery and tension thrown in every now an then, this game is for you",0,1

"Steam recommended this game to me because it is like Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale, spoiler it is not.

You start the game picking between a grand total of one character, the others are grayed out.  The character you get is a female elf.  She has an issue as her sister is missing.  She wanted to bake the female elf a cake, so rather than going to the grocery store, she went to the Obsidian Fortress to get the necessary ingredients.  

So to go rescue her you first go to a place in town and wait to unlock your skills.  Then you go and get gear at the blacksmith.  Then you exit the blacksmith and go right back since now the game wants you to upgrade your gear.  

Then you get to leave town and walk to the right.  You keep walking for a minute (literally) before anything happens.  This is when you are attacked by slimes.  You can do nothing but autofight them and then you run into mushrooms.  The mushrooms knock you back and to the left and stun you.  Once you are unstunned you keep fighting them until you collapse.  Then you are back in town to upgrade and do it again.

The enemies that stun you in an autoattack AFK game show the game does not respect your time.  Thus I will not give it mine.",1,0

"Certainly worth a try if you're curious, and want to play around with as it looks like the developer is taking an interest on the discussion board. It's a good starting point, and free so of course that always helps smooth over many of the issues. This is a first impressions only, and I will probably get back to it once it's been updated a bit.

The controls are a bit wonky, sometimes you teleport for no obvious reasons or spin in a circle. Once you pick up a weapon you don't seem to have any option to put it down, and the movement is a bit difficult to control in general. I'm not sure of any suggestions to make it better, it just seems to need fine-tuning. For example: I was trying to pick a rose and dropped it, leading to the thing rolling across half the map with me chasing after it between the hills of volcano. When the rose finally stopped rolling, I couldn't pick it up and finally decided to give the game a rest for a while.

You get the usual weapons: sword, axe, shield and bows, but you also get a spear you can throw. That's nice. Enemy AI is simple, but serviceable for now. Environments are very basic, but I'm happy to ignore those faults for now due to the early build given the developer does seem to still be working on the game and we can hope for future improvements.

I haven't seen any smut yet if it's in this version of the game, but it seems to be revolving around a single female character who you will complete tasks for in order to get her interest. All NPCs have computer generated voices, but they're decent quality, if unemotional. Future plans seem as though you will be able to engage with other characters, but how much variety of species/appearance or what you can do with them is unknown to me.

The game is definitely an alpha build, but the idea is interesting and I look forward to seeing where it goes. Given the free price tag, it's certainly worth a look if you're at all interested.",0,1

"Early Alpha level game.  I like the idea and when the bugs are worked out and it's polished, I can't wait, but right now it's difficult to play.  Game froze and kicked me out when I tried to save.  First person movements and attacks are very blocky.  Support the developers if you want and try it out, but as of now it is difficult to put in real time.

Difficult to recommend and review negatively, because it is early alpha and very cheap.  Hope the developers follow up and deliver a killer game.",0,1

"This game is the epitome of disappointment. I came to this game as an alternative to BF2042 but it seems it was made by the same developers This game was the highlight of my 2022. I was so excited to play it after watching the E3 trailer last year. When this game was nominated for Game of the Year I was so excited but yet the dev has failed to understand his single player base. Truly the world we live in. I just wanted to play a fun BF like game with insane movement and shooting. Instead we got a game in which I could not even do damage to the host. The host claimed it was because he was a friend of the dev and gave him an 'infection mod menu' from COD 4. He then proceeded to call me an multitude of swear words in this so called christian game and community.

I'm not mad at the devs I'm just disappointed. However, I will be keeping up with the development cycle and hope one of the fixes is that I can actually damage a person. I remember when I was in Afghanistan in the city called Dome, I heard rumour that this was going to be a third world war but after everyone saw that this game was going to be announced, you could hear cheers from the the streets. World War 3 averted thanks to Mirror Shoot ™℠®©.

Okay now onto the review of the game. It didn't work. I could not do damage to the enemy, I blamed REGO, he called me shit and screen captured the scoreboard, now my friends are bullying me for going -1 and 12. TY BluePrinting™℠®© developers.",0,1

"*Disclaimer * Review made for the steam awards event, so take this review with a truck load of salt lols *Disclaimer*

This is the second version of Cluedo currently on Steam and it is still pretty much in an early access phase of development. This game does have a few improvements over the original Cluedo released by Marmalade Studios,  along with its own issues as well (understandable as its still in EA).

Pros :
Better Character Models and animations
Better map textures
3 different game modes adding to re-playability
Various unlocks and achievements to earn through game play
Better and improvement detective notes, with more options to take notes as you play the game
Cosmetic Unlocks and Case Note Unlocks

Cons :
MP Lobby bare bones and slightly bugged - lobby quite empty and thus is hard to get a game
SP Ai requires more work, as the game is too easy even on Hard difficulty
Only 2 different maps so far
Occasional graphics glitch, but nothing too major (so far)
Cosmetic unlocks when equipped are glitched - some still show when not equipped.

So is this game worthwhile? Well the improvements made with this version and the 3 different games modes show this version's potential for a great title, although its current issues (especially in terms of MP and the ai) are currently holding it back. A lack of content ie maps and different character skins is also an issue as the game has a somewhat kinda 'unfinished' feeling, again though its still in EA.

Rating : At the moment  5/10 - buy and play the first version of cluedo first - its easier to get a MP game going in that game. I would wait another 6 to 12 months for further development in this title before considering.",1,0

"While this game wasn’t terrible, it suffered from the exact same issues that another of their games did. Namely, there’s no way to speed up the incredibly slow text or adjust the game’s volume from inside the game, and the animations were just as drawn out and boring, seemingly only there to be a time-sink. That’s not to say the animations are bad per se; they’re just overshadowed by the horribly slow and tedious mini-game. By the time you finish it, any enjoyment you may have had from reading is long gone.

Nevertheless, the writing was competent enough, and I enjoyed the game until the animations started. The three women you interacted with were mildly interesting, even if you barely got to know them since the game was so short. And even shorter than it might seem since you spend much of that time waiting for the sluggish text to appear. (5/10)",0,1

"[b]Tales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn[/b] is probably the most eco-friendly DLC on Steam :
With over 90% recycled content, it undoubtedly cements itself as a game that thinks about the planet... but not about your wallet. (haha... it rhymes.)

[h2]The good :[/h2]

- Tales of Arise has great environments and cast of characters. Any excuse to come back to it is great, and this expansion does just that.

- If you ever wanted to know what happened to the world after the end of the main story, this will cover it.

- New character named Nazamil is introduced, along with over 40 sub-quests, and some challenges in the training grounds as well as extra achievements.

- Lots of new dialogues & skits to go through.

[h2]The bad :[/h2]

- 90% of the monsters are not new.

- 90% of the areas to explore are not new.

- 90% of the sub-quests are about slaying monsters. They all feel pointless besides artificially inflating the game time.

- Your gear/skills/levels do not carry over from the main story. You start at level 65 with predefined gear. I understand they want to make the new story accessible to people that haven't finished the main story, but what would be the fucking point? Play an after-story without having finished the main story? Come on.

- Bosses don't feel as challenging as in the main story.

- The new story is okay, but it feels weaker in comparison to the main story. More could've been done here.

[h2]Conclusion :[/h2]

It pains me to put a thumbs down on this great RPG (play it, seriously), but for a 30 bucks expansion, I expected more original content besides the story. You're essentially paying 30 bucks for a visual novel; almost everything else is recycled.

[b]Verdict :[/b] Wait for a (at least) 30% sale. The game will still be eco-friendly even at a reduced price, so no worries.",1,0
"Lots of great additions, but doesn't seem quite ready for prime time just yet.

While Atlas of Discovery adds new items, skills, dungeons, and all sorts of interesting new mechanics, I believe that the new Ancient Relic Mode is the primary draw for both newcomers and returning players. ARM offers a higher power and productivity ceiling than other modes; eventually it will lead to End-Game content and dungeons becoming much easier. I generally view Ancient Relic Mode as the most complete version of the game. Almost like a New Game Plus or Post-Game for a JRPG. Those exclusive rewards and power-ups are quite tantalizing.

My first impression of ARM was largely positive. Capping skill levels incentivizes players to explore laterally and consider using skills they may not have paid attention to in a previous playthrough. It's also great that players are mandated to prioritize combat abilities and clear dungeons to unlock non-combat content. Melvor has so much to offer, that it can be easy to inadvertently ignore combat and linger too long on the other skills. Even in idle games, players often want direction, and I suspect that many players can struggled to decide where to start with the combat. Ancient Relic Mode starts to mitigate what is probably Melvor's greatest flaw - a reliable progression between clearing dungeons and non-combat events. It's almost like the players are being asked to pair wine + cheese.

When a game has an incredible, even overwhelming amount of depth and numerous ways to succeed, limiting early player choice via a method like level caps is a good design decision. It can make the game more accessible, enjoyable and provide a more consistent experience. 

Unlocking Ancient Relics and the accompanying skill power-ups also seem pretty awesome  - I'm happy with this feature so far.

Unfortunately, while ARM is advertised as challenging and requiring active play, that doesn't mean I was expecting it to be so punishing and restrictive - at least not until significantly later in the game. I bought AOD the day of release, and I came in with a decent understanding of the core mechanics. So it doesn't make much sense that I am stalling out and getting frustrated before being able to clear the second dungeon. And that even though I've capped most skills to their max of 10, 15, or 25, I'm being held back by a very annoying lack of more available recovery items. There is no good reason for this type of delay or requiring so much active grinding - I've barely gotten into the good stuff. This is especially alarming since I own the Throne DLC and because it will be an even larger barrier to entry for beginners and more casual players.

AOD adds 2 new skills: Cartography + Archaeology. Both seem like good additions, but since I'm focusing on my new ancient relic mode, I haven't explored much past 10. They both seem feature-rich and fun, and offer the discovery the DLC advertises. But neither seems fully polished. I was surprised by the choice not to offer simple in-game tutorials or a more expository in-game guide. The difference between survey and auto-survey seems wonky and weird! Why can't we manually survey more tiles when auto-survey can do so indefinitely? Sometimes we can set sail for only a short distances (in hexes) away. The open seas are supposed to be liberating but even the active game-play isn't too flexible.

Map-making and usage (for Archaeology digs) feel unnecessarily complicated and confusing; I couldn't even figure out how I was supposed to operate the first free map I was given. There are other indications improvement is needed. Does it really make sense to create the maps (and paper) needed for Archaeology in the Cartography menu? Not completely and it would make much more sense with a smoother execution.  Cartography and Archaeology still do many things I like, especially with checkpoint rewards - its a bit early for a full verdict.

I haven't commented on all the new features; There are many areas I haven't had a chance to explore yet but I have seen enough to trust I will be satisfied with the amount of added content. For example, the new lesser relic consumables appear to be well implemented and useful.

While I don't regret my purchase, I think that Ancient Relic Mode would greatly benefit from some early-game tweaking and possibly additional balance changes. That being said, I am fairly confident that the developers will patch in some timely improvements and be responsive to any upcoming concerns from the player base about their experiences.


Edit: Changed my review from thumb up to thumb down but please know steam is forcing me to express my review in a format I don't really like. DLC doesn't need to be evaluated by the same standard as a stand-alone game. This DLC is very promising and its execution errors seem fixable. Players who enjoyed the base game may choose to support the devs with a purchase even if they don't think the product is fully ready.


UPDATE: Since writing the review I've discovered an obscure feature called ""spam eating"" allows many players to clear dungeons that they could not clear otherwise. I don't think there are any in-game indications about the feature. I thought potatoes could only restore 3-6 hp/second not 30-60 hp/second (estimated); That's a HUUGE difference! This should be addressed.


One final note. The devs have repeatedly emphasized their desire to design all DLC (including future DLC) as standalone content with complimentary effects. This is a praise-worthy goal, but it may prove more challenging and risky than expected.",1,0

It has been a few months after I played the base game and I was a bit scared I forgot how the game was played, but within minutes I felt right at home again on my trusty ship... although it did fail me one time during the DLC. (PSSTT that was my own fault, but don't tell them ;)   )

Playing more DREDGe made me feel so appreciative again of how a game about fishing can have so much more story, be addictive, and have just awesome mechanics. The DLC gives you a new island, with a new mystery to solve. It is as big as the other islands, so if you already played a bit of the game, you kinda know what you're in for. It has one main questline and 4 sidequests.  

A bunch of the 8 new DLC achievements you'll unlock by completing those quests. There are others for collecting all fish, as well as their ""weird"" forms. And there is one achievement that does something with a new type of item you'll unlock. 

Most time of those 3/4 hours will be spent on finding the rare forms, but the new book you can find by one of the sidequests will help increase the % to catch them, don't forget to equip as many items as fit that increase the percentages on rare catches. And if you don't mind a bit of superstition... there is a topic on the DREDGE steam forum, it seems to help if you post there :P. What I also did when finding the last 2 is listening to this awesome song by Dan Bull: I'm heading out. the inspiration for that song was this game and it is just so good! 

I had a lot of fun to return to the world of DREDGE. I was quite harsh on the main character by not sleeping that much but we managed to get to the finish line :P.",0,1
"In short - this game is a shining gem with the Oculus Rift CV1, but do not bother with other hmds.

***

The game is 2/10 and utter garbage with my Valve Index (lcd) - so blurry it looks like having liquid butter in my eyes, Index controllers are dead (needs gamepad) and 2D video images aren't separated (look like 2 different images). Not even res 300% with my oc'ed RTX 3090 helps with the image quality.

Then I tried my great old Rift CV1 - it's like a night and day difference. The game supports native Oculus drivers and integrates into Oculus Home. Using ss 2.0 with the Oculus Tray Tool - now the game didn't look blurry at all but quite sharp. Touch worked perfectly, no need for a gamepad. Got solid 90 fps with ss 2.0 (that's 17 mill pixels per image for both eyes - much similar to Valve Index res 200%).

Setting the brightness, using Index the ""barely visible"" symbol could not even be seen before changing the slider, but was easy to see with the Rift CV1. Looks like this game was made for oled hmds - like the Rift CV1.

Choose your hmd wisely with this game - the game is unplayable with the wrong hmds. Index is not supported even if it says so on Steam, you need the Rift CV1 for this game - there's no blur at all with the Rift CV1, it's like magic :winking_face:

So my ratings: Valve Index = 2/10. Rift CV1 = 8/10.

This is a game which should just have been in the Oculus Store, in its current shape it's an Oculus-only game, it should not be on Steam. I believe the lack of Meta support for PCVR forced devs to release this Oculus game on Steam.

I took some screenshots using my Rift CV1 ss 2.0 - find them here:

So this game is pretty mid and has quite a few glitches, but has some promising parts as well the plants make a creepy noise when they work and the giant creatures are actually kind of terrifying looking. The story isn't the greatest, but it's not awful if you make the mistake of pausing the game when you unpause the menu will be there until you get to the final boss The middle mouse button for flash light would not work for me and my xbox controller didn't seem to have a way to flip the light panel switches so I had to use my keyboard/mouse and my controller to have 100% functionality in the game which is dumb af. In the final boss room it took me forever to figure out what to do because some of the objects don't block the wave like they should.

"*Jazz music stops*
*Alabama music intensifies*

There is a preference option to turn off Alabama mode

I write this review having not finished the game yet. 

The story starts slow but once it started going I found it hard to stop seeing the next step. It doesn't have much humour however it does have a few satisfying moments. Most of the side characters are interesting and enjoyable, none of the romances feel forced or free to get (aside from the one freebie) you actually need to pursue them for a decent bit and side with them to get there. 

The adult portions of the game were actually a bit disappointing, you can see the quality improve as you get through each episode from the start to chapter 7 I noticed a very clear increase in the quality. Also a substantial portion of the adult is exposition on top of renders with a few animations, early animations were a touch clunky the farther ones far better with better quality renders. 

A few warnings 
There is some Alabama music playing (can be toggled off)
There is an alien race with both sets of fruit. (interaction not mandatory)
It does push the boundaries on what some people would be comfortable with (all scenes given essentially a skip option on this or ""look away"" ""Think of something else"" ""leave"")

TLDR : Not finished yet however feeling good about it so far 7.5/10 more for the back half than the first half, a few things people will definitely not be comfortable with almost all avoidable.",0,1

Movement low key hype.,0,1
"Fun game, spent 40 minutes in it. But once you've understood the concept it gets old quickly.",0,1
"This game is advertised as a ""casual roguelite"", so if you're expecting more than a medium indie game length (4-7 hours) out of the main game, you're going to be disappointed.  That said, if you are looking for a nice experience with plenty of polish, you can certainly get that here.

Meta-progression is similar to many other roguelites which is not something I tend to enjoy due to grinding.  I still don't here, but it supports the casual experience the developers were aiming for.  I personally recommend playing on hard if you have played some amount of roguelikes before, as this game might be boring for an experienced player.

If you are new to (or have played very little of) video games, I can easily recommend this one.  It's easy and has a non-intimidating amount of depth.  Otherwise?  It's for people who enjoy cute games that are reminiscent of older 2D MMOs.  Note that replayability comes from player desire to use different builds and try weird combos of abilities rather than intense difficulty/absurd generation as found in Barony, Spelunky, or Vagante.  It's quite short and I wish there was more.",0,1

"I don't recommend nor not recommend this game, this review is mostly informative. I chose to use recommend because I could not bring myself to ruin the rating of this game with good inentions.

So, In this game, you just steer your boat around water, looking at scenery, honking your ""horn"" to guide you and say hello to the species around you, while collecting petals and scrolls. There's nothing wrong with it, it's a bit bland, sure, but it's definitely nothing bad.

My first problem with the game is definitely how long it takes to travel through places. I understand this is considered a walking simulator therefore it's not necessarily meant to be fast paced, but it feels really tedious and time consuming to get around, and when you've already seen everything and are just looking for the last few scrolls, it can get very boring.
My second issue is minor, but still present, which is that steering feels way too fast and janky. Steering a boat is meant to be slow, but in this game it's incredibly fast, which doesn't really fit with the atmosphere that it's trying to portray.
Additionally, which makes the steering's issue more noticeable, is the really low FPS the game seems to get, along with the poor camera angles, which makes it much more apparent how bad your FPS really seems to be. 

My final issue with the game is a spoiler for the game's ending:
[spoiler]The ending, while I found really cool, was very out of place and illogical. There was no build up or foreshadowing that the game would take a dark turn, and it made absolutely no sense. I love horror and whatnot, but this was very poorly executed. I understand the implication it tried to get at, but I really do feel as though there needs to be buildup towards it for it to work properly[/spoiler]

Other than that, the game's visuals are nice, it's relaxing, and the scenery is beautiful. I got lost a few times, but that's alright. Overall, the game is pretty good, and worth trying. I wish the developer luck on their future projects.",0,1

"Very, very, very, very reluctant thumbs up.

It needs a lot of direction and work.

Dev needs to stop copying rotmg 100%.  It's to the point where it's a really bad look, at least change the numbers around, or classes like a tiny bit?  

Rotmg is one of the oldest games on the internet and has barely changed...there is nothing but opportunity to create a better version.  This isn't a better version.  It's currently a bad copy.  
Add unique mechanics  Add unique content. Add story. Refine. 

Fix map design.  Many areas of the map & boss fights have projectiles the exact same color as the background.  
Many objects are so large that enemies can hide behind them.  Yes, enemies capable of instant killing if you get close. You copy every aspect of rotmg but create trees at 600% of the tile size of rotmg?  Fix them.

Already making huge mistakes in the tier system... weapons are either trash to the point there are thousands everywhere, or they're so unbelievably fucking rare they're worth 50+ hours of grind in trade value.
They copied an entire decade of rotmg's power creep on launch.
Like, seriously... there are so many blatant mistakes that you learn immediately in game design.
The game runs smooth, is well done, etc.  They just need proper game design and direction.  It's like a team of incredibly talented workers with no blueprint.  

There's an item that prevents death. Yep, in a permadeath game.
Remove that garbage lol. 
Two things always need to be true: 
1. Death can always occur
2. Safety is always one button press away

"[h1][b]THE SHORT GAME OF THE PRINCESS[/b][/h1]
Sometime ago, i'm pretty sure I saw this game on DLsite or some other website, but I didn't bother picking up, though I couldn't quite remember why. After playing it briefly, I realized that i'm glad I didn't double-dip on this one-- it's a very short experience, and the difficulty lies in whether you choose to have Estelle lose her virginity or not. Anyway, let's begin this review.

[h1][b]THE STORY[/b][/h1]
The story in this game is basically laid out for you in the first few minutes of the game, the game's synopsis, and if you scroll down and look under story. How do I feel about the story? It's bland, like the majority of H games out there. It's not the first time this sort of premise has been used, and there's quite a few strategy games that employ this sort of plot device that you can pick up on DLsite if you scrounge around a little and look for SLGs.

[h1][b]THE GAMEPLAY[/b][/h1]
Pretty simple, you can move your units as many tiles as you want if they're your tiles(indicated in blue). Touching an empty red tile or trying to attack an enemy will end the turn of the unit that was moved, and if the enemy on a tile is defeated, you will capture the tile as well. Aside from that, I mostly found myself using the archer to chip away at enemies on first hit, deal damage with the soldier, and then finish off with mage. I almost never utilized the Knight or Armor Knight, and somewhat utilized the Guardian Dragon-- they do virtually no damage and cost too much to heal to be worth using.

Don't engage an enemy if it puts you in a point where 2 or more enemies can attack you at once, try to bottleneck them if you're having issues. As stated earlier, the game's difficulty lies in whether Estelle is a virgin or not, and there ARE endings tied to the state of her chastity. With how short the game is, learn the game by popping her cherry as soon as you can, then go for the virgin ending on the second run; the game's short enough, and easy to understand to do as such.

[h1][b]THE GRAPHICS/VISUALS[/b][/h1]
Aside from Estelle and the CGs, everything else, from backgrounds, to units, etc were stock assets in RPGmaker, Wolf Editor, and various other engines  that you can lift assets from.

[h1][b]THE AUDIO/BGM[/b][/h1]
Much like the graphics, everything is stock-standard stuff you can lift from various engines and websites, with the exclusion of Estelle's voice actress. In other words, basically nothing to write about, though I will admit that I enjoyed the vocal performance, it was pretty expressive in a good way.

[h1][b]THE H CONTENT[/b][/h1]
I have to say it every time I write a review for an H game:
This is the section all of you are interested in.
To summarize, it's mostly just PZR, Mouth stuff, non-con, and eventually consenting(mild corruption, I guess). There's a few tags that some might be interested in, namely Somnophilia and Hypnosis, but it's very light, and there's only like... 8 CGs with a few variations. The H content is light, in other words. If you're a complete freakin' weirdo like me and have been in the H game scene for over a decade, you'll definitely find this game's H content severely lacking(alongside the game itself...).

[h1][b]MY PERSONAL ENJOYMENT[/b][/h1]
I'll be honest, I was strongly considering filing for a refund. The game definitely isn't worth $8, especially with how long it is, but I played it long enough that I could consider it a ""minimum wage"" level game, so for what it's worth, if you consider game duration versus price, then it's priced properly.

The game itself wasn't very fun to play, and gave no explanation on how to actually play the game, but it's not difficult to understand. Did I enjoy it? No, not really, but it made an hour slide right by, so I guess it's somewhat okay, at best.

[h1][b]THE CONCLUSION[/b][/h1]
The Winning Secret of the Newbie Strategist Princess is kind of a pain to play, but there's definitely worse out there. If you want to be silly, you can probably just pick the game up, grab the adult patch from OTAKU Plan's website, and maybe get a quick fap, then refund the game after. The game's short enough to do all of that within the refund window.

[h1][b]THE VERDICT[/b][/h1]
[h1]3/10[/h1]
Skip this one, unless it's on sale for 50%(or more). I'm not cheap enough to refund a game I beat, but I will definitely say that the game is [b]NOT[/b] worth $8. The only reason why the score is as high as it is is because the vocal performance was entertaining, and Estelle's dobonhonkeroos are just about the right size for my weirdo tastes.",1,0

"Full disclosure: I got this on sale for .90 cents USD. And that would be the top price I'd pay if no changes are made. The photos this time were a mixed bag, some being really pretty and some looking like personal holiday photos. A few were just OK to me, but given everything going on lately it's a nice attempt.

However, the game has a bug where after the first set of puzzles you always warp back to the first set. So you can complete a puzzle in the second set, and when you exit, you have to tab back to the second set of puzzles. Thankfully, it saves the page you were on at least.

"I'm not as firmly against this racing pack for Forza Horizon 5 compared to others. While I can see why people are annoyed at it (Mainly for not being part of the premium edition of 5), its a decent pack with some mildly interesting cars, with the standout to me being the Altimaniac.

However, I feel like that if Playground is going to have these kinds of packs to introduce more new cars, just bring back the Car Pass system like in Forza Horizon 3. Have a set amount of cars to be released on a monthly basis which you can opt in for all of them with the Car Pass, and keep them in individual packs like this one so if there is a pack that does appeal to you, you can just purchase this one without worrying about the others.

I feel like it would be seen as less negative, everyone has their choice of vehicles, and Forza Horizon 5 gets more financial assistance to keep improving the game.",1,0

"Wow, HEDE* is improving!

In a departure from their previous hidden object outings, this game is now actually in 3D and even features some animations. The zoom feature now works and doesn't constantly reset, and the preview of the item to be found is much clearer. Knowing HEDE's other games this is a huge improvement. And they are actually publishing it under their real moniker ... what is happening?

Sadly that doesn't mean much. The price is still [i]far[/i] too high as creating such a game will take an average developer not much longer than one or two days. The achievements work - that's something - but seem to be implemented wrong so they unlock after finding the first six items despite their descriptions suggesting they should be unlocking every 8. The camera movement is slow as molasses and there's no way to move the screen with the mouse. And while the graphics are at least a bit nicer this time the water just looks like oil. Maybe it [i]is[/i] oil and this game is a critique of the ocean pollution? Hmm.

Even with the improvements, at 8 bucks (or even 5 while still on sale) I can't possibly recommend this, sorry.

"A diamond in the rough
An RPG with a system reminiscent of Final Fantasy V and Live a Live
As for why I am making these comparing these games, the class system is similar to that of Final Fantasy V, like 
how you are able to give High Jump to a white mage in FF, you can give the ability to heal to a physical class.
And for Live a Live, it is separated in various parts and you playing a seperate character in each part.
Characters themselves are quite well written, and are quite likeable.

It is still in development but with what is currently is available, I cannot wait for more
Sadly, this games updates very slowly as months can pass without any major updates.

Although, quality takes time and the devs are very transparent.

Now back to something positive, the story and worldbuilding is great, with many details to be found and many choices to be made that changes the story and world.
Ergo, this game is game is quite replayable.

"Suppose that you were sitting down at this table. The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your ‘left’? Or the one on your ‘right’? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is ‘correct’ too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute ‘society’ with the ‘Universe’. The correct answer is that ‘It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.’ …Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‘society’… Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all. It’s not that anyone can fulfil this role… Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the ‘losers’.

Shattered Land Tips: 
- If you want to speed up the gameplay turn off animations (hotkey: ""A"")
- You can pre-buff area affect spells by having your full party visible (hotkey: ""5"")
- Thieves deal sneak attack damage when behind a creature (creature must be facing opposite direction)
- The game may try to force you to end your turn through a toggle (using all movement, being 'stuck' from a spell/effect), close the toggle and you can continue fighting (shoot, spell, attack adjacent enemies).
- You'll gain a lot of XP playing through the game so creating characters with at least 2 classes is definitely worth it (I beat the game with 3 characters with 3 classes, and one with 2 classes and they were all near max level by the end, so would definitely be max at 2 classes each)
- You can max your stats/hp by clicking the box next to the number during character creation (max constitution before maxing HP)
- There is a 'default' party by loading the game and pressing start game without creating any characters
- Money is nearly useless so don't worry about looting everything
- Haste is the best spell
- Dual wielding weapons gives no determinable penalty and you can attack more
- Some higher-end enemies can destroy your armour / weapons permanently, so keep an eye out for the text (it flashes quickly).
- Clerics are unique in Dark Sun; each elemental sphere of cleric has its own unique (and small selection) of spells. Clerics never learn healing spells or resurrections other than Cure Minor Wounds, while Druids get Cure Serious Wounds, and Cure Critical Wounds, as well as the Raise Dead spell. Clerics are seriously under powered/low-utility.

Wake of the Ravager Tips (adding as I play through):
- Left shift key skips the opening videos
- The default Half-Giant gladiator character (Gerakis) starts with a special weapon, so start with him and transfer the weapon over and drop/add a new character in his place if you want the weapon but not the character. (may also appear in inventory of new parties?)

"LOVE the design of the player character

But the game summary hypes itself up a little too hard, combat is very simple (melee attack spam) and easy (enemies die in 1-3 hits, and often don't even get a chance to hit back). There is no objective beyond ""find the end of the level/game"" (no clue if the blue collectibles are supposed to do something, the game never tells you what they are) and I think I found only 4 NPCs that have very short interactions, and two of them were at the very end of the game. Majority of the game's story is told in the store page's description, if I hadn't read that, I'd have no idea the player character was supposed to be wearing a disguise the whole time? Not sure why that stuff couldn't be added to the start in the form of narrator exposition or monologue by the character itself or something.

Even with all that the game is by no means bad, the environment, characters and animations look great and the gameplay feels smooth and responsive. It'd be a great base to expand on but I understand many student projects don't have the time or resources (or even want) to do that.

"I wish I could give a neutral review. This is a fun hidden kitty game, with cute art and little secret spots you can only find by clicking everywhere lol. I found it more frustrating than not though. Clicking certain spots requires precision, it's finicky, and there's hints, one in particular, where I've clicked all over the place with no success. Switching rooms can be a pain if you don't know where to click (make sure to click doorknobs or the arrows if they're present). When looking for secret kitties, be aware of tiny buttons *cough* side of computer screen *cough* and the light switches on lamps. I'm indifferent when it comes to the magnifying glass feature rather than being able to simply zoom in. I really don't want to leave a negative review, as I love these types of games and this art style, but it caused me some irritation I haven't really dealt with in other games similar to this one.",1,0

"I agree with the reviewer that said this was not the best game in the series.
If you've played the others this will be disappointing in comparison.

I had no problem with wands without stars.
They reminded me of every wand I ever saw a stage magician use.
Did the wands of the fairy godmothers in Disney's OG animated Cinderella have stars?
I think not.
As to stars on wands, well maybe if it's for a 5 year old princess.

The unicorn artwork was ok, with puzzle 15 a standout with very nice equine looking beasts.
That was also the puzzle that the last unicorn I found was just it's butt, no leg just the butt, all else being hidden and needing a hint to find. 
Poor form.

"You know they say that all games are created equal, but you look at me and you look at WWE 2K23 and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another wrestling game, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add AEW Fight Forever to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 way on Steam, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning, because AEW Fight Forever KNOWS he can't beat me and he's not even gonna try!
So WWE 2K23, you take your 33 1/3 chance, minus my 25% chance and you got an 8 1/3 chance of winning on Steam. But then you take my 75% chance of winning, if we was to go one on one, and then add 66 2/3 per cents, I got 141 2/3 chance of winning on Steam.

The original was flawed but the basics were addicting. 1st Your thief is useless in combat until you are lucky enough to find a bow and I still haven't found one. How about make one available in the store. 2nd.. TAKE OUT LEVEL DRAIN! 
The game is a grind but having a mob hit you and permanently reduces your lvl is insane. My priest was ready to lvl up and she gets hit by lvl drain so not only did she drop a lvl she also lost her lvl up so that was two levels lost not one. The spell to teleport you out needs to be moved to a level four spell. It's stupid that every time you exit the labyrinth it resets your map progress. Also if you decide to run it completely makes the map go crazy and it becomes useless. My biggest reason for the negative is the lvl drain ability mobs have. The game is a huge grind and to lose two levels on a single hit is insanity. Two hours lost in second.",1,0

"While Team Fortress 2 (TF2) undoubtedly made its mark as a classic team-based shooter, it's time for it to take a backseat and reflect on its shortcomings. Enter Overwatch 2, a game that effortlessly surpasses TF2 in every aspect, leaving the latter feeling outdated and inadequate.

Overwatch 2's innovative hero design, intricate abilities, and dynamic team dynamics put TF2's limited class-based system to shame. TF2's aging graphics and repetitive gameplay pale in comparison to Overwatch 2's stunning visuals and immersive environments, making it evident that TF2 should hang its head in embarrassment.

The introduction of story-driven elements and engaging PvE modes in Overwatch 2 showcases the evolution of the genre, leaving TF2's lack of depth and variety exposed. While TF2 may have once been a frontrunner, Overwatch 2's freshness and refinement expose it for what it truly is – a relic of the past.

In the grand scheme of things, it's clear that Overwatch 2's superiority isn't just about being newer; it's about pushing boundaries, embracing innovation, and leaving antiquated games like TF2 behind. It's time for TF2 to acknowledge its inadequacies and step aside as Overwatch 2 takes the rightful spotlight as the superior and much more impressive game.

"Pros:
1)AI is gathering fleets in one big plob during the war now;
2)AI became better at building economy;
3)Game became faster (both in performance sense and in game(no more restrictions for science labs and rare resources production buildings));
4)New Megastructures and switch of payment for spy operation from energy to influence allows you at least some way to spend it.
Cons:
1)AI fleet composition is awfull (mix of all ship types in the end-game (after 2285) ); it results in AI fleets being desintegrated by 2 times smaller fleets;
2)It looks like AI doesn't consider overlord power, when declares war on vassal (same issue with guarantee independence);
3)vassals are broken: basically the only two ways to make them pay you anything are either to subjigate them by tributary war, second - send them new terms of vassalization over and over again untill they wouldn't have enough influence to refuse (didn't try myself);
4)Heard that low stability dilemmas are impossible to resolve without revolts; didn't experience this issue myself, but AI is definately struggling with it.
Overall, AI became better, new buildings look cool, game performing better and gameplay was speed up as well.

"The second DLC ever to come out for any TSW, I do love this one for the nostalgia as well as the nice and easy runs and the variety of gameplay.
Unfortunately, and I do understand that its not possible to go back to every DLC in a major way, this is in desperate need of some love. This route worked quite well for a long time, but since some bugs have been introduced that are possibly game breaking. Also, though there is quite a lot to do, for a 4 track route this feels quite empty. You do see quite a few AI on any run, but most of the time you feel you have all four tracks to yourself. Also, no other stock layers on here, which is sad.
The route and track layout is as great as it always was. Lots of possibilities, a lot of it unrealized.
Scenery-wise, this route still more than holds up and looks great. Though setting it during caternary construction in my eyes was a questionable choice. Wanna do diesel as is, leave it. Would have been better for Diesel Legends, too. Otherwise an electrified version would have been interesting, too. But I do like the HST.
If you are not really out for the HST or GWE, you probably will have a much better time with Southeastern High Speed and/or London Commuter.",1,0

"It's incomplete. I can't describe it any other way. It has some growing pains it will likely go through in the near future. I think the first thing to address is my headset because it causes the most incompatibility with games I've seen so assume anything that relies on it (height, tracking, controllers, etc.) could just randomly have problems. That aside, some games work well on it, so I know it's possible.

(I think) headset related bugs:
-Sprinting it difficult to activate unless you're looking at your hands, likely due to camera positions + how it reads the up and down movement, I would've preferred a more accelerometer based approach but this might have been more reliable idk.
-The 'abxy' buttons are not mapped by default so dash and jump need to be mapped. I published my config, all it is is abxy mapped.
-Reaching over your shoulder or for your side weapons in difficult, they don't line up on my body.
-My arms/shoulders are like a second set of arms beneath my arms that meet at my hands, this wouldn't be an issue if they couldn't collide, but collision is important for realism so idk.
-Response to controller movement is average, which would be better if it didn't rely so heavily on it working.
-My height felt all wrong, I left it on auto but even when I set it manually, things felt off.
With WMR/Reverb G2 issues out of the way:
-The weapon rack had the executioner's sword off center, and it's trigger would prevent you from grabbing swords next to it even if your hand was essentially touching the other sword because it's trigger area is so large. 
-The ice magic staff I assume is meant to represented by the top diagram on the stone pillar but it's diagram is clockwise, just like the fire, when it's actually counter-clockwise for the spell.
-Dialogue is all but inaudible when not staring basically right at the character.
-Triggering the bell at the blacksmith is challenging.
-The tutorial has a boss, this boss is fun but nothing about the consequences of dying were explained (matter, weapons on the ground, potion loss, etc.)
-The way you are intended to move the panels when ordering at the blacksmith is unclear: can you grab it, or only slide it, why is it so hard to trigger? 

Now I've griped, let's talk about what they did right, which is what I'm very happy with and why despite what I mentioned above, I played for 2 and half hours without taking off the headset.
1) SteamVR. It works great, and binding adjument on the fly worked a charm. What buttons 1 and 2 were wasn't clear but everything worked so it's fine.
2) Game feel. I felt immersed, wanting to swing my sword with accurate and powerful blows (though the speed might not affect damage, idk). This is a game I can see myself playing again and becoming invested in the story and progression of.
2a) Magic. Very fun, balanced by limits on knockback, shields, and mana pool. At first I thought it would make it too easy but mana regen speed means that when your pool is empty, you feel more at ease if you pull out a sword or hammer to fight with while your mana regens. I've got the ice and fire staves and they have similar function-ish with great recognition of what is and isn't the right shape, only wish it worked vertically. Can't have your cake and eat it too, i guess.
2b) Weapons. With immersive combat comes a need for fun and varied weapons, and what better way to serve that than by giving that? You have axes, swords, hammers, daggers, spears, shields, and magic staves all of which have multiple variants to craft. Choose handle, blade shape, guard, etc. 
2c) Potions and materials. You lose all but your starting potions when you die (provided they are unused) but materials aren't kept with you. Both materials and potions are 'hidden' throughout the places you might engage in combat. Materials are for weapons, they are schematics (for the previously mentions weapon building) and resources like wood, iron, and gems. Potions are used to recover health and/or mana should you choose to use them. They can be found the same way as materials: as occasional drops or as loot/hidden treasure.
3) Skill tree and armor. I like that your armor is free and interchangeable depending on your build, just like resetting your perks is so you're very free to explore different playstyles. Health regen to compensate for choosing heavy armor? nice. things like that.
4) Switching it up. There isn't a time I've encountered (except when I died, all enemies respawn if you die, loot doesn't, go collect your corpse) that made me feel bored. I never thought about quitting because there was nothing different. The story doesn't force too much on you and it plays easily, keeping your interest the while time.
5) Menus. Pause is a thing (not): you can press your settings button and the game keeps going and you're still able to move. Accepting quests and interacting with the guide felt very natural. I especially liked the nod to accept.

Overall, I'd say they've got work to do, and not just for WMR. Bugs are common in a early access game and I really look forward to what this looks like in a few months when it's more mature. Overall, I recommend this game with the understanding that what you;re getting is still being worked on and it not done yet. Also. the herbalist looks weird (so does the old man, but that's just old people). To devs reading this, good luck, I can see you really care about making this a great game.",0,1
"EDIT: Switching the resolution to the lowest setting actually helped the game run better, and I no longer have consistent performance issues. If you're trying to switch your resolution, you have to try pressing the arrow keys AND enter before it updates. It's an entertaining game for sure, I got it again because of the patch fixing performance issues so I could give it another honest try.

Not really sure what is wrong with this game but the first time I booted it up I literally couldn't move because of the lag. I reinstalled the game and found that it only ran at a shocking 20 frames per second. I managed to make it to level 9 of the first world, but really the biggest enemy here was the timer. Would be a cool(?) game if I could actually play it. The timer sucks!",0,1
"Just can't GET ENUF of this. 

The OST includes [b]MP3 320 and WAV files[/b]

So grab it all in just one place. Conveniently stored full quality funky soundtrack.

- VA - Jet Set Radio OST (both released and unreleased parts)
- 2 Mello - Memories of Tokyo-To
- 2 Mello - Sounds of Tokyo-To Future
==============================
Some personal highlights of the OST:
Personal top:
2 Mello - I Wanna Kno | neat funky vibes from this one
CYBERMILK - Condensed Milk | anime something something song, won't fit everyone's taste
Sebastian Knight - Feel The Funk (Computer Love) | funky~

Personal bottom consists of songs that are overusing annoying repetitive samples:
GRRL - Operator | ""OPERATE, OPERATE, OP-OP-OP-OPERATE""
Olli - Precious Thing | ""LET ME SEE YOU SHAKE THAT... A$$ A$$ A$$ A$$""
Color Plus - Hair Dun Nails Dun | ""GOT MY HAIR DONE I'VE GOT MY NAILS DONE""

The rest is good and fits the game and the theme nicely.

Also the voice acting is awful. Just pure cringe. 

Despite these flaws, this prologue is free, and I am interested to see the final game. Although it seems to me this game has had very little testing, and probably needs a beta or some kind of feedback system.

"[h1] Sadly has not much content [/h1]

[h3]Title: Cozy Fishing[/h3]

[b]Introduction:[/b]
Cozy Fishing is a game about, well, fishing. The fishing mechanic itself is very similar to Stardew Valley, except the bar is shorter and sideways. There are four main fishing maps, plus an aquarium to keep track of each of the 20 different species of fish you have caught.

[b]Graphics and Atmosphere:[/b]
The game has a fairly calm atmosphere. There isn't much to see but there are atmospheric sounds. The graphics are good looking and overall the game has very little visual bugs as far as I can tell.

[b]Gameplay and Achievements:[/b]
The entire objective of the game is to catch all of the fish. Something that can be done within very little time, even the most casual of game fan can finish this game in one sitting. There are no descriptions to the fish you catch, no additional content other than catching the existing 20 fish species. Some fish do seem rarer than others, I spent half of my short game time just trying to catch the sunfish.
On the other hand, getting all the achievements is fairly easy since they are tied to catching certain fish, which as mentioned takes almost no time at all. 

[b]Issues and Challenges:[/b]
I only really found one visual issue, that being on the last map, where water seems to go into the boat but that is by no means any sort of game breaking bug. 
This game is no challenge at all.

[b]Replayability and Longevity:[/b]
There is little to no repeatability. This game is easy to complete and features almost no content. 

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
If you like repetitive games with little to no substance or are just looking to increase your achievement count, then this game is for you. The atmosphere is not nearly cozy enough to keep me playing, especially because of the lack of any sort of additional features. If you are planning on getting this game, I would suggest getting it on sale, despite the low price tag.
 
I don't like not recommending games but at the current state I can't give a recommendation without feeling bad about it. If I could give it something in between, I would.

[b]On a different note: the developer(s) seem(s) to be working on their next game and I'm exciting to see what they put out in the future, since this is by no means a bad game.[/b]",1,0
"I think the game is actually very fun as a small arcade game. It does come with it's flaws tho.

The good:
- Quick 10 minute battle  with AI team deathmatch (5v5 or 10v10)
- Three different gamemodes
- Good time killer
- Some costumes
- Fun arcade-style gameplay
- Ass

The bad:
- Lack of weapons (only three: pistol, assault rifle, shotgun
- AI can be broken as they can spawnkill you quickly
- only one map, and kinda small, so it can happen that the AI will spawn next to you and instantly wipe you
- Line gamemode seems to be the least fun as you get killed kinda quickly and can't really balance it between shooting the shooter or the runners.
- Had one time where a zombie was invisible or spawned out of the map which caused me to not finish the wave

What should I'd like to see to be added/adjusted
- Health bar and ammo should be next to player character so you can keep track of your health
- Some sort of health regen or lifegain when killing an enemy
- More weapons, (marksmen rifle and SMG would be great)
- More maps, preferably bigger so that the 10v10 can be even more fun to play.
- The aiming seems to be a bit weird on all guns, meaning you cannot really be accurate long distance
- More characters and outfits
- Adjust the Line gamemode slightly to make it more balanced, maybe a health pack every now and then
- A dash in zombie mode (even if it's a longer cooldown)
- Aiming and aiming while crouching seems to be more of a burden than that it helps you aim better, maybe it's the camera angle.
- In zombie mode, you cannot refill your pistol ammo (the gun is displayed on the map, but you cannot pick it up)
- There's a glitch in zombie mode where if you stand at the dead end with the two parasols, the zombies stand still and won't attack you.

Overall:

I still had a fun time playing the game and I would play it every now and then just to kill time.
I've also noticed the dev is pretty responsive and updating the game based of other reviews which is already a big plus to me. I hope to see this game more polished and more additional content.",0,1
"[i]If you are interested in eroge games which contain actual gameplay and not just the pretty pictures, follow us [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/42611799-Quality-Eroge/]here[/url][/i]

I have been waiting for this one to come out. Where to even begin.

The game is basically an auto chess clone, with sprinkled in eroge. There is no ""city management"" to speak off. The game  basically consists of 2 phases. The base phase, where you can upgrade your income, number of units you can deploy etc., and the battle phase, and you have to repeat this for 40 days(turns) So far nothing special.

The meat of the game is basically in its second phase, where you buy and deploy your units in formations, and let them duke it out with the opponents. Your units all have different abilities of their own, and have 4 different classes and races which provide various bonuses if you deploy more of the same race or class, and you can even upgrade your units by buying more copies of them from the store, which randomly offers you units which you can refresh for some extra gold.

This can provide some replay value because otherwise the battles aren't random, no matter how many times you start over the game, battle 10 or battle 12 will have the same enemy lineup, but you can't see said lineup before the battle starts, you have to remember.

Before I get to the eroge part of the game, it's also worth pointing out, that before you start a campaign, you can build a deck containing 10 abilities, like reduce lust by 20 for 200 gold, or next battle your units will deal 8% damage. These abilities are basically what you can decide to use in the town phase, the only problem is, that some of these skills are mandatory, so if you unequip them you are certain to lose. One such skill is the reduce lust, cuz if your lust meter reaches max, its game over.

Now on to the Eroge part. The game is trying to please the corruption lovers (its all about letting your character turn in to a succubus or resist and remain pure), but sadly, the writing and the translation is....not the best, so enjoying them can be difficult.

The art is also hit and miss. Some CG looks good, but some looks pretty bad.

You can also have unique events with certain units if you've bought them, but those are few and far between. (Yes this isn't just a Yuri, there are male ""encounters"" too)

Overall the eroge part of the game, leaves me with mixed feelings. It's not bad, but the simplistic writing/translation (not sure which one to blame) makes enjoying them pretty difficult, then there is a the mediocre CG.

But the actually game, and the whole corruption process is overall good. It's definitely worth the price. After you've beaten the game there is also an endless mode.",0,1

"I really like this game, the issues for me is the glitches, like, was this play tested at all? Anybody play it to make sure bugs were minimal? It really feels like this game was rushed out. Hopefully the devs will release patches for it soon.

Issues I've had:
When I press D to open the relationship chart, it is blank and I can't get off that screen. Only solution is to go back to main menu.
Missing text for a medical visit.
Challenges get really messed up pretty easily.

Also the FISHING SYSTEM ISN'T GOOD!!! A spear can go directly through the fish, but I don't catch it. It is incredibly obvious that this game was made for console, which isn't bad, but also annoying when there are challenges that are next to impossible on keyboard, and there is no way to change the controls, which are also super wacky and not normal.

My suggestion for people planning on buying this is 1: Wait until it's on sale or 2: Wait for them to update and patch things up. This game has a lot of potential, but it's really buggy and feels unfinished at this point in time.",0,1

"I am a 52 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing Thyria: Step Into Dreams. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son found this game at Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. Loaded into the game world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

"This is more of a mixed review, but i'll leave a thumbs up because it's important for me to support a developer like that and i want to see more.
The game is weird in a quite a good way, there's plenty of fun systems, the fighting is nice, the stealth is difficult but possible, although i mostly end up just fighting enemies. The movement is extremely quick and overly responsive, personally i do prefer a sligthly slower pace, but it's overall good stuff. The level design is good? There's a lot of shortcuts and multiple paths to the same places, but it didn't make me really look for cool stuff, and i got lost in the end. Like i don't think i'm going to finish the game because i simply don't understand were else i can go and what the game wants me to do.
But my biggest problem is visuals - it's really stylish overall, and i do like it, but it also makes the game actively hard to play. The game is very pixelated, which turns this into near-sightedness simulator, and combined with extremely high movement speed this just doesn't feel good. You already have to move almost by touch because of how little you can discern from the enviroment, but then the level design pretty often expects me to do high speed moves and jumps.
Hopefully this project leads to a lot of experience for developer and we end up getting a more refined and expanded version of similar systems and ideas in a new game.",0,1

"50多个小时打通了，整个作品算是高开低走，有上限可惜没做好。评价不分先后，想到什么写什么。

1. 【难度】难度算是大败笔之一，纯堆数值没有动态平衡，感觉就20多年前仙剑的难度水准都没有，后期就很无聊
2. 【经脉】比上面做的更差，感觉就像是想做但是最后不知道怎么做，就随便摆烂一个在那
3. 【自由度】自由度过高，一开始就中原全图都能走，从侧面引发第1点里的问题
4. 【锻造】烂中之烂，还不如扣掉不要，锻造升级也是摆烂，后期材料也是不知道哪里搞，图纸也不是很齐
5. 【精力】可以有，但是不要这么恶心，学专业就是来回一直跑，差评
6. 【武学点】也是堆数值，前面稍微练多了，后面加入的就是弱鸡，也是第1点的侧面体现
7. 【队友】这个可能和剧情有点关系，比如小彤就根本没必要加入，小雪和玄女也是过于频繁时进时出，都是虚伪的女主，陪伴最久的还是上官虹姐妹，分配个女主不过分。而且最后结局的时候玄女和小彤都不能入队，小雪还是强行入队的，就一个突兀。
8. 【切磋】有些个高难度切磋是放那骗人的吧，正常打根本就切不了，送礼都不让送的，简单点可以扣掉，不用让人去修改游戏。切磋要用主角，导致这个游戏主角不强就玩不了，侧面反映了队友都是废物，平时混就完事了，还能带这么多人在身边，实在是浪费开发资源。
9. 【AI】AI也太笨了，敌对的不会绕后，自己的也不会用范围
10. 【战斗掉落】装备掉落也太高了，虽然基本都是垃圾，侧面更不需要锻造系统了，一个高级垃圾比低级的锻造好用多了
11. 【感情线】拉胯，评价是可以扣掉不要，强行天降女主就很尬，略等于没有铺垫。看好感系统貌似以为是自由度高的感情线，结果一拖答辩
12. 【好感物品】杂而无效，看似多样化，实则完全没必要
13. 【支线】支线反而比较有意思，但是有一些支线任务和道具指向不明
14. 【即时制】由于前面提到的难度问题，这个系统真的有必要存在吗
15. 【NPC】很多可以“交易”，但是都卖的垃圾，有必要吗
16. 【武器体系】看似多样化，但是也没有克制系统，优劣其实也挺明显
17. 【多周目】好像也没有二周目奖励，打通一次就僵住了
17. 【结局】猝死，感觉就是作者突然就死了，后面的人不知道怎么结局就直接写了个句号，而且只能上固定2个人，再次突出队友都是垃圾

"After a 110 hours of Stellaris overlord and not touching grass, this is what I think of the new DLC...

Vassals:
Before the update, vassalization was one of my favorite parts of Stellaris...
It still is.
The fact the entire vassal system for the base game was changed overnight, is going to cause problems and it has.

It can let you delegate micromanagement of planets to AI, whilst getting resources for it, to avoid mental illness.

I did not have any major problems with the vassal system as I kept the loyalty at max at all times. It seems that subjects have become more powerful to the overlord. I don't like that you need very niche conditions (subject has inferior technology) to be able to negotiate integration.

Scholarium - Taking 45% of basic resources, and 75% of technology, with extra research bonuses, of a 20 planet empire is overpowered, whilst also lowering subject naval capacity (so they don't rebel) is very useful. This is my favorite vassal type.
Bulwark - Expensive for both subject and overlord; useful for defensive purposes as subject gets defensive bonuses.
Prospectorium - Basic resources in exchange for science. Best for resource rich, and science poor subjects.
Subsidiary - Basically: the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer. Useful for taxing resources. That's all they do.
Protectorate - The only type of vassal that can be integrated. Subsidiaries can automatically become converted to protectorate if they fall behind overlord in technology.

I was not disappointed with the new vassal system, although I found that an empire on the other side of the galaxy had 3 bulwark vassals which seemed a bit broken, and gave them an edge over all other empires. I am not sure about the vassal rebellion system though, as I kept the subject loyalty high.

Megastructures:
The megastructures are the best part about this DLC, all of them have uses (apart from quantum catapult).

Quantum Catapult - Virtually useless by the time you can built it; just use gateways or wormholes.
Matter Decompressor - Can be useful without vassals, but subsidiaries can give you minerals anyway; situational.
Hyper Relays - Very useful for transportation, almost replaces gateways; acts as a galactic gateway.
Orbital Rings - They are just a mini starbase on your planet, that can enhance it (i.e. add districts, increase production).

Enclaves:
The enclaves make the game more interesting, and can make military fleet management in the game stronger and more versatile.

Salvager Enclaves - Never had a need to scrap ships for alloys, I prefer to scrap them in combat, and only one spawned in a huge galaxy; mostly irrelevant.
Mercenary Enclaves - AI likes spamming these whenever possible. They are useful, but take up a lot of naval capacity, and cost a lot of resources to maintain. You can destroy them to remove the fleet that an AI player is renting, however they will eventually build another mercenary enclave anyway.

Conclusion:
If you're planning on completing a full grand admiral difficulty game on a huge map, it's better to not buy the DLC and touch grass. It took 5 real life days to complete the last 100 years, on a mid to high end PC with this DLC, which contributed to more game lag. 

However, This DLC makes the game more interesting, which is good, despite the insane lag of having 6-8K empire population, which the game wasn't optimized to handle, nor was the DLC.",0,1
"Very simple and straightforward (free) survivors' game, where the only real progression between runs is unlocking other characters through killing bosses. While the rest of the game is just for the achievements right now. Since it's free and without game breaking bugs, no reason not to recommend it to people who love the genre and wish to help the developer to improve it.

Though the game uses more resources than such a game should even if it's a bullet hell, given the graphics, the low amount of enemies and the complexity of projectiles.

Has a pretty slow start at every run where you just wait for enemies to get to you. Bosses are kinda pushovers, maybe besides the last one and even that more because of the short time to kill it, while the freeze on bosses is too op, should give it some kind of cd.

Lack of some kind of reward for surviving whole 15 minutes, especially since you don't even have to kill the boss. Ideally would be great to have some progression system between the runs with currency/ies to improve stats/items etc.

More elements you could add are electricity, poison/nature, dark/shadow/death, light, water, earth. Summons probably would be too imba with the current state of the game.

Later could also add some endless mode but then you need somehow to make the game hard enough which would make you lose no matter what at some time.

At first it's not obvious that freeze damage is not the same as cold damage, as opposed with fire and burn damage which you could guess is not the same but think that fire would still add to burn. could add more info for the skills on pause menu and create icons for them instead of writing their names.

The no damage taken achievement is also a bit vague, can you reroll for example (practically taking damage to do so) and does getting hit when you have a blue heart still counts as being damaged? While the inconsistent reward from bosses/mimics isn't great, red potion is totally not the same as a blue one, so should remove the red from the mimic's drop

Since terrain objects block projectile, could add some feature to ricochet off those objects too with a skill and add explosions as a skill, along with traps or without.

If you can get over the thought of another guy pillaging your woman's poop deck,  it just might be the best medicine for a sorry love life.. I mean it worked for that dude who Let Dennis Rodman plow his wife, while he spent time chilling in the Worms mansion, watching his TV and crying in the closet while he choked the chicken..

The Story - 

Anyway, sad story aside, it brings me what you're all here for the main event,, the whole enchilada.. Sex Story - Cuckold life Ep 1..  The Story is what you'd expect from a game called Cuckold Life, it's the story of a married couple..  Adam and Nikki. Adam comes home early from a work trip he surprises Nikki.. After a few pointless scenes and text she decides to let her Boss give her the old Meat Rocket as a way of putting spice in their love life..  The game goes about how you'd expect from 2.99 cent visual novel.. Completely devoid of anything worth while.. and the translations are kinda lackluster..

Gameplay - 

Press the Space bar and read the REALLY slow moving text. Make some choices which have absolutely zero effect on the game..  Want your wife to wear black panties.. LOL.. no way bro she's going with Red..  If you can't figure out how to play this game in 2023, then I'm pretty certain you'd have some issues with staying alive if your body didn't' automate your breathing.. 

Pro's - 
Easy achievements
Counts toward the +1
Bewbs???

Con's - 
Broken achievement...  The one for finishing the story is broken, it took me a while to unlock it after playing through like 18 times, then it randomly unlocked in the middle of my fifth play through
no speed text or options at all
no animations (for 2.99 can't complain too much I guess) 
Weirdly worded text, probably translation issues.
Choices mean nothing....

Recommendation - 
The game has a few pros..  for starters the easy achievements..  play five minutes and finish the story (finish the story seems to be semi broken), the lack of options ANY options, is really frustrating, means sitting through the same boring story numerous times to unlock the finish the story achievement.. The fact that it's really cheap and adds a +1 to your library count is beneficial to game collectors, the fact you can get 100% completed game in under an hour is another benefit to achievement hunters.. If you're looking for a visual novel that is engaging and interesting, this isn't for you, if you're looking for a visual novel that tells a compelling story, this isn't for you.. If you want a +1 to either you're E-peen (game library) or your E-Scrot (Achievements), then by all means buy it.. if you care about any thing else,, just avoid it..  Snooch to the Booch",0,1

"I want to add something different then everyone else reviewing the game so enjoy .   I cant recommend this game for several reasons the biggest reason is i had to grind for 20 hrs before any interesting sec happen. When it finally did happend some of the it was really great .I didnt like the MC because half the time he came off as a perv and not a guy in a harem .  There are so many good AVNs available and i thought this could have been one but no.  Yes the female selection was great with the MILF, best friend,  Bi chick , curvy shy , Asian, redhead , silver hair alt girl, and Dancer girl. This game became bearable with the cheat enabled and it super annoying that there is no go back button choice . Then again, some of last scenes were really good art and the MC had the best looking D of alot of games because it looked natural . I have to admit its probably really hard to draw cunninglingus accurately but what they did was not how its done .

"Whoa. Coming as someone who played portal prelude when it initially came out back in 2008, the immense negative response seems hyperbolic. No. This wasn't created by Valve, just some small team and I'll admit it, the puzzles aren't great. The source engine's use of momentum combined with questionable puzzles is where the true ""challenge"" is.

My nostalgia might be preaching here, but the new tech and the updated voice lines really makes this feel like a labor of love to the Portal community. Specifically to those that played the original mod. I am pleased with what NVIDIA and the original mod team have done to update this mod. Its a shame it appears to have passed it's time for praise. Yet I will gladly have my cake and eat it too.

If you decide to venture forward past the negative reviews, then please read my following suggestions:
•Get comfortable with quick save / quick load, use them liberally.
•Adjust the RTX settings to your liking but prioritize performance. (Press Alt + X in game)
•Consider using a walk through when truly stuck or No-clip when momentum puzzles are kicking your butt.",0,1
"It's weird. The developer clearly has amazing ideas, but the execution on a technical level didn't win me over.
I liked bits of it, but it is a very ""watchable"" game rather than a ""playable"" one, but it's 250 INR (5$) so I can understand.
As for each chapter:

1) Split Screen and Alone: I really liked the differences between what the player sees and what the camera picks up. To notch wizardry there. And the monsters contorting the way they do, all Blood Starved Beast (Bloodborne) looking, the audio design, lighting. Loved everything, except the ending. It diluted the whole experience for me.

2) Just a Peep: Loved loved this one. You basically do tasks, walking around pressing E. But the pacing and the art style akin to a black and white Hylics is absolutely wonderful.

3) Intermission: There's some actual gameplay elements in this one. This is pretty fun. Ended up clicking ""ATTACH"" for 5 tries. 11/10.

4) I Think I Hit Something: Very nice mish mash of various perspectives. There's a tiny bit of a disparity between artstyles but it's okay. It gets over way too quickly.

5) Don't Look Up: Press W. Game over. Nifty core idea hindered by its overly simplistic nature. And the voice line audio is much quieter than the voice lines in the rest of the game.

6) REPEAT. REPEAT. Compulsion: Did not finish this. Keys would not register, and due to the resolution scaling of menu elements, most text would be out of the screen.

7) Sheep's Gun: The game we all brought this game for, and it is easily the best of the bunch, Very good. Very. Very Good.

But due to constant stutters, and the basic overall feeling of ""meh"" I wouldn't recommend it in its current state. But I will be keeping an eye on this game for future updates, QoLs; and will be keeping an eye on the dev. The person is meant for great things in the horrorscape.",1,0

[i]Roma Invicta[/i] is a strategy game that combines turn-based conquest management with real-time battles. It has a lot in common with the [i]Total War[/i] franchise, but obviously without the massive AAA budget. The core gameplay involves back-and-forth battles between the Roman invaders and the Gallic tribes defending their territory.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
You start out on a small campaign map of Western Europe. Your mission is to start in Italy and eventually conquer every region on the map. There’s a basic supply system that requires you to feed your soldiers, as well as an economic system that gives you money to spend on food and soldiers, but it’s extremely straightforward to the point where it feels dumbed-down. Not everything needs to be a grand strategy game full of political intrigue and complex economic simulation, although a little more depth would have been appreciated.

Once you get into the real-time battles, it becomes more challenging. The AI isn’t spectacular, yet it still manages to provide some much-needed difficulty. The limited amount of possible army compositions means that you will usually fight with the same units, give or take a few. Strategically, you’ll always be trying to execute the same general plan, just with some minor twist. It gets stale after a while, but the game is pretty short and doesn’t overstay its welcome.

After playing the campaign, you can try out the custom battle mode, which removes the strategic map and focuses only on the real-time battles. It’s a nice bonus but ultimately didn’t do much for me. This may change with the recent addition of Steam Workshop support, but this review was written a few days before that feature existed, so I can’t say how meaningful it is.

[h2]Presentation[/h2]
I loved the graphics, despite them being a little odd-looking. Every part of a soldier is modeled individually and it’s cool to see all the different moving parts during combat. The tradeoff is that performance is significantly worse than it would be with traditional animations. It didn’t impact my enjoyment, although it might be a deal-breaker for someone with an older PC.

[h2]Verdict[/h2]
[i]Roma Invicta[/i] is far from a perfect game, but considering the price and its low-budget indie status, it comes out looking fine. It manages to do more things right than wrong, I just wouldn’t give it a strong recommendation. Fans of the [i]Total War[/i] franchise might enjoy it as a smaller, less complex version of those games, although it probably won’t scratch the same itch.

[h2]6/10[/h2]

"TL;DR: A single tiktok managed to set expectations for this game in such a misdirection, that everyone came in expecting a successor to Green Hell or whatever else came to their mind. This game is nothing like that. I doubt that was the only reason for the game being hyped up, but it was at least for the initial hype. Paired with the performance issues at launch, that's the main reason why people reviewed it negatively. Most never played the whole thing because they weren't able to at launch, but you are now. It's just a 3 hour long story-based game about a dude trying to escape an island. Just try it out, it's free, no harm in doing so. Just give it a chance, don't ignore it because of the reviews. But that’s just my opinion.

If you're reading the comments, deciding whether or not to get this game because of it's negative reviews, I'll give my honest opinion on the game here, but let me tell you something first: This game is a really good example of how TikTok can completely fuck people over. 

The main reason for the massively negative response is the fact that 1.5 (as of this review being made) million people saw a video on TikTok about the game, and like I, decided to wishlist for what the TikToker said, taking their word for what this game would be. Looking back, this game is nothing like that review, and my only guess as for why is because the TikToker saw the ""Explore, Solve, Fight"" tag and assumed that it would be like Green Hell or Sons Of The Forest. It didn't help that it also had ""Online CO-OP"" as a tag, which the TikToker spun into  playing with friends. His entire account is just lazy, he does that with every game releasing that there's no info on. It probably took him 30 seconds to read the steam page and then another minute to spin that into something that would get him views. He mentioned so much stuff that was undoubtedly enough to hype people up for the game. This set people up with the hope that it would be this and that, have survival elements, be CO-OP, basically so much more than what the dev had really put on his steam page. A single steam page. That's not even enough to base what a game is like on, and yet all these people assumed that it would be whatever they thought it would be. 

This game is nothing like what that guy said on TikTok, and that's okay! Honestly, it's an amazing free game, I was running it on max settings and it ran fine, the areas looked gorgeous, enemies looked terrifying, and the people looked realistic. It's a short game, only took me ~3 hours to beat, but for a free game, you're getting a lot. The story is almost like a COD campaign, where you can replay missions and its entirely story centered. You play as Jeremy, a teen who is along for the ride investigating an island. His group gets separated, and picked off, and Jeremy must escape from the island. The story has a few twists, and the ending is pretty shocking, and overall the story is decent. Felt a little bit too twisty, in my opinion, but I don't think its unbearable. The puzzles are interesting, and actually make you think. Some of them I understood in seconds but other people had to ask on the community page, which I see as a good thing, if it's able to get people thinking and the community helping each other.

Sure, the performance wasn't amazing, but definitely better than expected. I just want to close this review out by saying please be kind, supportive, and give feedback to the dev, even if negative. Just remember the fact that he created all of this alone, put his own time into it, and possibly his own money. What did he get in return? A game that was drowned in negative reviews by people who played expecting what some random dude on the internet said, and a game that would be perfect at launch. Think about how it feels to him. Negative reviews are fine, but be more constructive than ""The guy on tiktok lied :steamsad:"" because this dev isn't even affiliated with him.",0,1
"UPDATE:

After getting back into it and playing it after a few months I can see the ladder climbing is a bit better however its still a pain to deal with like in blast pit and places where you have to climb really long ladders, it'd be better if it was like HL Alyx where you could just  teleport to the top of them.

Also one big issue I have is the more you die the more the audio breaks and after a while only a handful of sounds will play so you have to restart. This was a big problem for me in blast pit as its easy to fail the jumps that land you in the toxic waste, some jumps are a pain to make so would be nice if you could teleport across some gaps. 

The trains are a bit hard to control, not sure if I'm just doing it wrong but I really don't understand how to make them go forward and backward. 

Most guns reload sounds don't play so you can't tell if they reloaded unless you look at the ammo count. 

Some of the soldiers audio sounds slowed down for some reason.

Weapon switching is in now but its very inconvenient, you have to scroll through them all to get to the right one, would be nice if there was a weapon wheel.

Overall a bit better now and more playable but there are still a lot of issues that can hopefully be improved upon. 


Original Review:

A good start but definitely needs a lot more work, some of the ladders you can't even climb to the top at all making progression impossible unless you switch to legacy ladder climbing, would be nice if you could just teleport up ladders like in Alyx. Also there seems to be literally no way to switch your weapon at all, you have to take off the headset and change weapon from the game on your desktop so that sucks. Also the movement and turning is a bit nausea inducing, really needs teleport with blink turning. There's also no way to change options from in the game, you need to exit it to launch the config tool and there's no way to open up the normal game menu in VR, you have to take off your headset if you want to change options or load/save game. Also one really bad thing is the game seems to crash quite often so that sucks, sadly wouldn't recommend in its current state, will change review if the mod gets updated.",1,0
" Why play it?

"The new weapons are very fun and powerful, but the DLC area itself is kind of underwhelming (compared to expedition anyway). Not much lore at all, even if you get the secret ending by helping the boss. The companion is good enough, certainly far better than I expected from a game that was not designed with companions in mind.  

More on the dungeon: if you try to clear it like a traditional dungeon, slowly looting everything and checking every nook and cranny, you will have a bad time. The enemy patrols are tough and spawn very quickly (but not infinitely, though there are a very large amount of them). Sneaking through is surprisingly easy even with no stealth, mostly because enemies are not static -- so you can probably make it to the end of the dungeon without even seeing a single enemy if you are quick enough and make the right moves.",0,1
"[h1]Beautiful Singing Boys recruiting…So, let the Squid Game begin, boy band edition![/h1]
Hanbyul is a young girl with a dream… She wishes to have the opportunity to be at the center of the spotlight with an audience enjoying her songs. Thing is… Life is never easy, and she will have to do everything within her power to overcome debts and also her grandma’s hospital bills, on top of that. So, in order to guarantee a good source of income covering all their needs. She decides to participate in a contest in which a boy band is looking for a new member to join their ranks, as a way of killing two birds with one stone.
The protagonist decides to crossdress as a boy to have a chance and win the cash offered in the aforementioned contest. Leading her into a living situation that could feel similar to the TV show called Big Brother… But the Korean edition.

You can choose between some options for your preferred disguise, three available for hairstyle and other three as per choosing an outfit of your liking. A little funny graphic issue I spotted before the game was patched, made me think: If you want to really disguise yourself as a boy, never forget about finding a way for your b00bs not to bounce around giving your disguise away!

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3078678587 
The plot most of the time is really easy to guess, with not so much of a plot twist to offer to the reader, and also the way of rushing the available routes as to try making you feel aware of them, feels, like, imposed and sometimes ridiculous, as the situation unfolding couldn’t be the worst timing ever for that to happen.
[spoiler]Her grandma is in a hard condition regarding her own health and the doctor is interested in asking for your number because he wants to take you out on a date… While what you wanted is a way to ensure that once the surgery costs are paid, the treatment for your closest relative will start and proceed as promised. And that’s only one of the examples you can encounter[/spoiler]
Her self-image can change a bit drastically sometimes… Going from having confidence in her own abilities to almost feeling like there’s no possible way she can do it. And that would be understandable, as it sometimes can happen in real life, but within minutes, changing her thinking so much is hard to empathize with.

There’s no skip button available nor a way to rewind the conversations or check the log, and given the fact there’s only one save slot available per walkthrough… You should be careful with your choices!
The background music in general, but more so the one trying to portray tension in the scenes unfolding ( the aforementioned, a bit excessive to be honest), can be cut out suddenly once the scene finishes… Which gained, more than once, one of my eyebrows rising at the abruptness.
One thing I would like to praise the game for, is the portrayal of the so-called Korean Wave or Hallyu, hard working conditions. Usually, all we see is glitter and not the pressure conditions the artists have to constantly endure… Even though within the game they touched the subject in a subtle way, it is good to see the problem being mentioned.

The romantic interests available:
[list]
[*]Cho Jin: The uptight guy who cannot keep up with his menacing attitude for long
[*]Chris: The easy-going guy who likes to cause mischief
[*]Haley: The supportive female option
[/list]
[h1]Things I would like to highlight:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Six languages available (Surprisingly, including Spanish, yeah you've read that right! But don’t expect the translations to be perfect. And that’s okay, it is more than the options we can usually choose from, in this genre)
[*]No way to hide the hud, so if you are planning to take screenshots, the text will linger there, hiding half of the art you wanted to capture as a memento.
[*]Character sprites have movement animations, and a more realistic art style!
[*] Well designed backgrounds
[*]Sometimes the menu freezes and you have to keep clicking around for it to react to your commands.
[*] The characters’ own opinions can change soon after having said something… It’s quite contradictory most of the time.
[*]Would be nice if the romance routes could be a bit slow-burn, but instead of that, the forced proximity suddenly burns in your face within five seconds after the love interests first appear. And the situations trying to give off vibes of a possible love triangle are far from being successfully intriguing.

"This would be a neutral review if it were possible. I landed on ""negative"" because it doesn't look like the devs were even trying. If anything changes for the positive then so does my review. 
[i]-UPDATE: I'm tentatively changing to ""positive"" after the dev reply below... aww, and losing my ratings lol [/i]

I only checked out casual mode, which is pretty much - and I don't use this term lightly - a mildly interactive screensaver. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, if that's what you're looking for. Just be aware that it lacks even the most basic things you might expect from an actual game. 

If you've seen the trailer, you've seen most of the game. When the screen turns black, that's not a cut to a different part of the game - that's what it's like. You see your relaxing (?) lo-fi shark swim around and then suddenly, often without any visual clue like a gate of some kind, you're teleported to a different scene. There don't seem to be many of them, and some are tiny. Some locations look interesting, but from what I could see there are no items to find and no ways to interact with anything, you can't even stop unless you hit an obstacle. I experienced quite a lot of clipping through rocks and stuff like that. 

I see potential for patching this into more of a game, if the devs are interested in more than a money grab (which I have my doubts about). Things in need of adding: an options menu with video and audio settings, something that makes it clear where you'll get to a new scene (maybe a magic portal that would explain why things suddenly look different), a compass or something else that helps with orientation, maybe even a map that gets uncovered as you explore, a little intro, a nicer loading screen, probably some collectible like shells or whatever... There are a lot of possibilities that would add more value. 

Idk, maybe survival mode is mind-blowing, but according to the description the only difference is that you have to eat fish (presumably just by swimming near them). Casual mode as it is now... I had it running while I was eating something and it was nice enough for a free review copy, but I wouldn't have felt good about paying the current introductory price for it.

"The game follows the familiar story line of the famous story, but adds small independent intrepretations that gives that little extra feeling of familiarity combined with uncertainty. This is of course not to say that M. Poirot, with his charismatic moustache and accent, is not single handedly capable to carry the game on his own.

Though the plot is very similar to the original, it is set in a modern setting with mobile phones and other equipment. This aspect is well integrated as a plot device, which doesn't simply feel forced in for the sake of nothing but formulates an intriguing story of deduction.

The game itself, while excelling in the 'feeling' of the plot, still plays a bit uncomfortable with slow movement with relatively large maps, making it frustrating moving from one side to another when you forgot to speak to a single person, resulting in sighing and loss of interest. Therefore, the deduction and other vital investigative parts of the game remain pristine, according to my experience, but the room between these seem simply annoying, and something as simple as making the doors inbetween the train wagons open with you moving into them rather than activly opening them with interactions would have made it more tolerable.

Overall a great detective game, that captures the spirit of such games, but an annoyance in navigating between these scenes of deduction.",0,1

Firstly, the game needs some optimisation work. I don't have the greatest computer around but it should certainly be able to run the game better.

There were also a lot of issues with vehicles. I think I was only able to actually drive one (a tractor) but all the others would freak out and start bouncing around the moment I tried to enter them. There was also an instance were I was teleported a bit away after entering one.

Some other issues I had:
- The default volume is way too loud (and if I remember correctly, there wasn't a way to change the volume once you are in a match)
- The 3D audio seemed to have a really long fall off range, so vehicles that were really far away sounded as though they were right next to me",1,0

You can view my gameplay & early impressions here: https://youtu.be/Q343Ip14qYc

So consider this a neutral recommendation. I honestly wasn't having fun playing this game. However, I do think that others may find it more appealing. As a hardened VR veteran, I just don't think this type of mini-game type gameplay / shooting gallery appeals much to me given my experience playing hundreds of games like this. 

I really thought this would bring back the nostalgia of Paperboy, which I have fond memories of playing as a kid. However, this game really didn't bring back those fond memories at all. It's just really more like an on-rails shooting gallery where you're throwing newspapers, phone books (fire or electric), or shooting at stuff. There's just too much visual noise and it's hard to pick a target. I was disappointed that you don't actually control the bike, just put your hands on the handlebar at the start (set it and forget it).

While the aim-assist is very generous, you just have too many targets. It's sensory over-load really. You barely get to notice any destruction you may have caused just due to all the visual noise. Unlocks are also very easy at first, then you grind to almost a total halt, having to replay levels to try to get that extra challenge done.

Game is running on the Unreal Engine 5.1, but I honestly wouldn't have guessed that. Performance was less than optimal, although I was getting mostly 90 fps on my RTX 3080, I would get severe frame rate drops at times along with some stutters. Which is odd because the visuals were less than stellar, especially around the waterfalls. The music also wasn't that great, which is a must for an arcade type title. 

I think others might enjoy this game more than me. However, as a hardened VR veteran with over 10k hours in VR, I just wanted to stop playing at about the hour mark. And that is exactly what I did. Hopefully, the game gets much better once it leaves Early Access. Maybe some future updates improve the game substantially. Right now, it's just lacking for me personally.

"New updated review: Hey look an update finally, keep them coming.

Updated Review:  Seems like the developer didn't find the initial success they were hoping for on release and this EA title is dead in the water aside from a bug fix here and there. I loved the look of it but if it's not actually going to get developed further I have to change this to a thumbs down.

"It's a cool mount that is large and onyx or as many comments say black...

It was released as part of a pre-order bonus, but I am sure one-day when the game does begin selling DLC this will become available to everyone for the price of like $25!... Hopefully not that expensive, at most $5 and that is pushing it IMO. Anyways for now this isn't available anymore as the game has been released and you can't pre-order it once it's released... 

I marked that I got it for free as it's really free; unlike the Deluxe Edition clothing and stuff which you only get by spending more on the Deluxe or Special Edition, this was really just a free bonus for pre-ordering the game... it didn't cost extra, the game (normal and special editions) cost the same now (at release) as they did as a pre-order.",0,1

"This is a hesitant recommendation. I had fun experimenting with The Last Commander; I love the art style and concept. However, the clunky UI and lack of tutorial or tips makes it difficult to access.

The Last Commander is a cool concept - it's a tile-based base building game that involves really tight resource management integrated with real-time horde defence space battles. I also love the boardgamey art style. However, it desperately needs a tutorial or UI upgrade.

"There are things I like about Bonding Ambivalence. Namely,
-The sound design (especially the soundtrack)
-The visuals (there are less interesting parts, but certain enemy designs and visual set-pieces really stand out)
-The combat (satisfying and cathartic after spending so long on puzzles)

That said, I would be lying if I said I generally enjoyed playing the game beyond it being something to do with a buddy.

-The puzzles, whilst sometimes clever and interesting, are typically gated behind finding a particular panel or object that is far from easily spotted. Often, my buddy and I would be stuck, wondering how on earth you were supposed to solve a puzzle, only to discover that we hadn't checked some random corner to get the item / flip the switch we needed.

-The roles, while neat in theory, often boil down to the hacker getting to do most of the fun stuff (hacking terminals to their benefit, having access to most of the information needed to progress, and wielding better guns with more ammunition) while still participating in the team activities. Leaving the infiltrator to mostly just walk around trying to find some bio-data they can scan, or a panel they can open. (admittedly, I was the one playing the hacker, so this is based on second-hand information) Supposedly the infiltrator's draw is their mobility and stealth, but their mobility consists of the ability to slip into a few infiltrator-only zones (leaving the hacker to wait for them), the ability to jump (which my buddy confirmed after playing that it was never once necessary, or even useful), and ~possibly~ a faster running speed (by the end of the game we weren't sure, so take this one with a grain of salt). As for their stealth, to quote said buddy ""There was literally never an opportunity to sneak past anything.""
-The story is serviceable, though the antagonist never felt particularly threatening/interesting/memorable to me. Of course, this is rather subjective.

Overall, there is plenty of potential for a great game here, and at times, the game realizes it's potential, but as far as enjoyment goes, constantly waiting for each-other in sections where only one person can act, and banging our heads against the wall at dead-ends made for an experience I thoroughly didn't enjoy. And I was playing the funner role.

Still, the game might be for you if you're super observant and have a duo who's just as observant. Provided one of you is willing to play the infiltrator.

"As a Survivor game, this is the best one that's ever been released - full stop. On a first playthrough, it is very fun because you're able to make decisions that affect your relationships with your tribemates, play in challenges (that have wonky controls but after you beat the learning curve, they're alright), and strategize your way to the end (or win every challenge like me LOL). However, after you beat a season, there's very little replay value.

This would all be alright if this version wasn't 1/3 OF THE FRENCH VERSION RELEASED TWO YEARS AGO. For something that I spent $22.49 on, it was very disappointing to learn that Season 2 is the most that this game offers. The original French game ""Koh-Lanta"" has 6 seasons, shinier graphics, and fleshed out island life mechanics... and all we get is two seasons? The latter season glitching at the merge so you can't even access the relationship chart because there's an extra 8th player at the merge???

I've gotten all I can out of this game and I only played 5 times: Season 1 three times because I got med evac'd Round 3 twice and won 4-2, then Season 2 twice because I was a losing finalist (lost 0-7), and then won 6-1. The game is too easy to complete and seeing a FINISHED version that was made two years ago doesn't make me feel like my money was well spent.

Overall, I would recommend to wait until the game is FINISHED before spending your money on this. In the meantime, play Outlaster on ROBLOX to get the full experience and more because it accomplishes everything here for the wonderful price of $0.00 (unless you don't want to play with actual people... in that case idk what to tell you)",1,0
"Gosh damn is this a great looking and enjolyable game! (Is what I would like to say)

The aesthetic design and progression are very enjoyable. Levelingup gear and finding new loots is the best!

I have had this on my Wishlist for Months and I was very excited to finally get to play it...

But, there are some issues... The complete lack of controller Support is sort of lame. 
The Hitboxes are very difficult to nail down. I have turned my mouse speed up to the maximum and still struggle to get my cursor in position in time.
The Delay on the right mouse button to use the shield is very frustrating, there is a delay on the deployment of the shield which makes it very easy to miss.
There are no Trajectory lines when reflecting objects and so that can cause them to fly in all sorts of directions.
Trying to attack a target while having to simultaneously pull back for a block and factor in delay for shield deployment or to deflect a projectile away or towards the sender feels incredibily stressful and is very difficult.

Overall, it is a neat game and it sure is a looker. I just wish the controls felt better. If you have any type of motor impairment disability in your arms/eyes/hands however than this game is literally just not for you.",1,0

"Foreword: Don't buy this if you are computer illiterate. Transition from the hub-world to some of the games wasn't always so crisp and there were plenty of technical difficulties that would make most people tear their hair out or just drop the experience entirely. I had compatibility issues with every Unreal Engine game and intense screen-tearing in the hub world despite v-sync. I have a pretty standard 60hz monitor and a 2080 Super so things should have been fine.... That said...

This has been one of my favorite video game experiences of all time. It is my first (and hopefully not last) Dread X Collection. The games are a mixed bag, the hub level is full of screen-tearing, and the unreal engine games in the pack have to be played in Windows 7 compatibility mode... but man, what a ride. 

It felt like I was playing through a Creepshow movie. Every game was it's own short, new horrific scenario. And there is something incredibly satisfying about playing through what basically amounts to experimental game design. When it works, it feels like you've discovered something new and exciting. When it doesn't work, it still feels like an interesting experience. And they are all short enough to where you don't feel like your time was wasted if you didn't like one. At least not significantly. 

There were a few games where the means of progression felt tedious, repetitive, or unreasonable, not in difficulty, but in practice. I really don't like QTE's and they weren't set up well for controller in Gallerie (maybe I should have lowered the difficulty?). Interim should have never tried timed platforming, though there wouldn't really be a game-play aspect to it otherwise. And finally, why wasn't there an in game end game for Ludomalica? You just go around and around the game board with no end in sight? It nearly made me think that the game had no ending whatsoever and I nearly put it down. I'll also briefly mention that last chase in Beyond the Curtain. The hit-boxes were unclear and I had to restart it about five times. Atmosphere and horror go by the wayside when all you feel is frustration.

I won't write down my least favorite, I feel like the developers deserve respect for what they've made. These were all small teams and I still enjoyed a technical aspect of the one I really didn't like. 

But far and away my favorite was We Never Left. It was exceptionally well crafted, tight in story AND technical execution. I don't get scared at video games or films, I'm too desensitized to them. I understand too much about how games are made to be frightened. But We Never Left made me excited to [spoiler] look out and see if what was on the computer had affected the game world. It was even more exciting to see that it did affect the game world every single time. Little touches like footprints in the laundry and coffee room were exceptional. Or the doors opening when he entered the bedroom... oooh that's good stuff! [/spoiler]

Here are some things I enjoyed from each game:
- the book puzzle in The Book of Blood
- the dreamlike feel and twist in Karao
- the game within the game in Vestige
- the concept of the game in Ludomalica (the rules of the game)
- the grotesqueness of Julie's story and integration of ASMR in Gallerie
- the bizarreness of Hunsvotti (and its overwhelmingly satisfying ending)
- the artstyle and general vibe of Resver
- the proto-surrealist architecture of Beyond the Curtain (and the opening and ending puppet shows)
- the cartooniness of Spirit Guardian
- the third person gameplay and Silent Hill ""feel"" of Rotten Stigma
- the integration of live-action MP4 files in Interim
- literally all of We Never Left (including the outro video which was surprisingly crisp considering the game's file size)

Last but not least the hub world, Outpost 3000, which was incredibly fun in itself and often loosely set up whatever next game I was going to play: for example, going behind the curtain before Behind the Curtain, or going through files about missing children before playing Rotten Stigma, or playing a video game within a video game before playing a video game within a video game within a video game in Vestige.",0,1

- Intriguing hard-sci-fi setting, that has a rather realistic take on how space development would progress after an early discovery of artificial gravity generation.

- The story has some interesting themes, such as what constitutes sentience and the perception of reality, which are particularly fitting for the setting type at hand.

- Between tasks, puzzles, exploration and dialogues, there’s enough variety to prevent the adventure from getting stale until the end. 
[/td]
[td]
- Despite a solid choice of topics, the game doesn’t fully explore their potential with its plot, which ultimately feels underwhelming, even if it does keep interest up for the most part.

- Very low level of interaction with the environment. Apart from mission-related items, there will be very few secondary interactions for the most part. This makes the experience feel lifeless while exploring.

- Excessive exposition dumping towards the final stages. Instead of gradually introducing events and lore, for the most part the game stays cryptic, to then rush most things in a very short span near the ending.

[h1]In-Depth[/h1]
[h3]Setting & Writing[/h3]
An alternate history 1999 has humanity colonizing most of the solar system thanks to the discovery of advanced artificial gravity generation, which allowed long-range space faring and the construction of stations and outposts alike. Protagonist David is an ordinary nobody, broke as hell and living in a claustrophobic concrete cubicle somewhere on Earth. The solution to his problems approaches unexpectedly when, at the beginning of the story, he gets recruited for a well-paying job on a far-away fuel extraction station - the titular Titan Station, that is. In a ‘Space Odyssey-esque’ environment that blends high tech with 80s aesthetics and laughably impractical furniture, many interesting things are yet to happen to our unsuspecting character.

Yours will be a speaking protagonist with most of its dialogue choices predetermined, while some of them will be up to you, choosing between a limited series of replies to other characters. The quality of writing is more than passable, however the acting doesn’t always hold up, as David (and also other characters) won’t always sound as preoccupied, anxious or startled as he should, during the more conceited situations in his time at the station. Notably enough, there doesn’t seem to be multiple endings or ‘wrong’ dialogue responses that may lead to different events or ‘failures’; whatever you reply, the result will be the same in the grand scheme of things - which is somewhat disappointing, especially in a few cases where more could’ve been done to emphasize smart thinking.

Nevertheless, the narrative, dialogues and plot evolve in a mostly interesting manner, with a constant influx of turnarounds and new information that keep interest up. It’s a shame that the latter phases of the story feel rushed, as far as narration is concerned, with massive ‘exposition dumps’ typical of a story that wanted to say more, but then the development budget went dead-ass broke and they had to somehow put a patch on it. Or the writers just were lazy, the result stays the same. Overall good… enough.

[h3]Exploration & Dialogues[/h3]
The space sprawl extends on multiple layers, connected by a multitude of service tunnels, airlocks and sections that each require specific authorization levels to get through. Most of it will be blocked at first, as you’ll have to follow the orders of the commander, Jack, and proceed with your tasks; doing so will generally give you, in one way or another, the means to access previously-locked-out parts of the station. There is a decent number of files, datapads and documents to find and sift through, that will give you a better idea of what the other crewmates have been up to, and about what happened before you arrived. Some narration relies on environmental clues and indirect means, so not everything will be conveyed through files or recordings.

Dialogues are mostly held through radio or other comms equipment: they’ll have you choose different ways to reply or questions to ask sometimes, but in general they will be linear dialogues with minimal differences. Nothing will change majorly depending on your answers or choices, even if sometimes I felt like it should have been a thing. A missed opportunity for narration surely, however the story itself remains good, even if without a meaningful choice component.

[h3]Puzzles & Objectives[/h3]
In general, your tasks will be straightforward and entail finding a series of items to use in a specific order. This is kind of the first type of puzzle, which could be classified as a ‘hidden object’: finding codes or items to proceed forward, like a door code, a keycard upgrade, and so on. There’s another type of puzzle as well, that takes place in virtual reality and will have you connect rows of colored cubes, as well as mixing the colors, to open gates and successfully hack computers or other systems. None of these puzzles is overly-complex or obscure, and they are an enjoyable variation from the usual running and looking around for stuff.

"For a $1 game, you can kind of guess what you're getting yourself into. It's a janky indy horror game. I wanna just say I was given a key for free to test this out.

Visually the game is okay. The walls of the apartment are probably the worst part. The textures are really weird and like overly large or something. Other than that, I honestly thought everything else looked fine. Not AAA, but it's an indie game, so I'm not gunna hold that against them.

Be warned that this is mostly cheap jump scares that play loud noises or make something suddenly appear in your face. I can't really say that the atmosphere was all that tense otherwise.

The gameplay is basically a puzzle game. You have to do certain things to advance the game forward until you get to the point that you need to solve a combination lock. This is where the game really got rough for me. The clues are very weird and I got lost for the most part. I managed to figure out what the two middle digits were, but the other two I had no idea. I looked around for about 15 minutes, getting more and more bored as nothing new was happening until I solved the puzzle. Thankfully another review has a youtube video showing the code. I just used that and moved on. The game ends shortly after that but the last few minutes are probably the best part of the game. It is a tad unsettling and plays with your head a little bit, which was nice. Although I'll admit it's all things that had been done before, but at least it was pulled off well.

The sound design is okay. As I said before, there are loud jump scare sounds, but there is also a subtle unsettling sound playing in the background, which was a nice touch. Also some eerie sounds will sometimes play just behind you, which did make things a bit more tense.

The story is pretty much non-existent. Based on the title, it seems you are a new tenet moving into a rental apartment? The landlord, I assume, leaves you a note saying they couldn't see you in person, so they left the key on a box. That's the story, there's nothing else I could glean from any of the other notes that had anything to do with the story. In fact most of the rest of the writing is really strange and made no sense to me. A lot to do with symmetry, but I dunno, I might just be too dumb to figure it out haha.

The game is mostly stable, I didn't have any crashes or anything like that. The game also doesn't have a save feature, but it really doesn't need it. If you can solve the combo lock puzzle quickly, you can beat this game in under 10 minutes. If you already know the combo, you could speed run this game in under 5 minutes I imagine.

I did run into 2 bugs though. First, if you close the pantry door in the kitchen while you are inside the pantry, you can push yourself into the corner where the door will open in to. Then open the door and hold the direction toward the wall and you will clip through the wall right into the fridge. You won't be able to escape and will softlock yourself. Honestly I found it kind of amusing.

Second bug was that you could manipulate the combo lock by just looking at it and pressing W or S. You didn't have to interact with it, you could just be walking around the kitchen, look over at it and hit one of those keys and it would scroll the numbers.

I'm giving this a thumbs up but honestly I don't think this game should be a paid game. That said, it's $1, and I think by now people should know what they're paying for when it comes to super cheap indie horror games. Personally I think the dev made a decent game for their skill level. I imagine they are probably just starting with game development and I always want to encourage new devs to try their hand at it. So congrats on making a game at all. That's more than a lot of people can say. Keep going and try to improve on your game making skills.",0,1

"There's a foundation for a great game here but sadly they missed the mark. One major issue I have is characters, there's only 12 total and they get randomly placed on different tribes each season. Having the same characters over and over again but on different tribes is straight up bizarre and would never happen on the TV show. A previewer lied and said the castaways are randomly generated (even replying to a comment saying body types get randomly generated too). 

But besides that i'll list some things I like and don't like.

Likes: 
+ Nice aesthetics, it's not graphically amazing but its very pleasant to look at and I like the overall graphical style they chose.
+ Fun challenges. Both reward and immunity challenges are fun, varied and range in difficulties. Some are a bit too easy but it is what it is.
+ Good social dynamics, kind of. You can create alliances and ask people who they're voting for or tell them who to vote for. It's simple but not too simple, it's a good start if this game were to keep being worked on. 
+ Balance of daily life, challenges and social play is nice.
+ Rock draws if the vote ties twice. 
+ Great music, not the same tracks from the show but very similar. 
+ Seasons are long, my first season took 2+ hours, personally I like that it doesn't feel rushed.

Dislikes:
- Survivors will NEVER come to you and ask YOU who to vote for or attempt to make an alliance with you, this might be a minor inconvenience for some but if you're a fan of the show you know how stupid it is for one person to do all the social work in a video game.
- Kinda too easy to get people to like you and equally as easy to get them to hate you. 
- Controls are awful. Keyboard controls suck and my PS4 controller didn't work. 
- 12 characters total, you can't create your own and there's no random generator to mix things up.
- Tribal Council is a HUGE event in Survivor and in this game it can feel quite anti-climatic, which is a shame. 
- You can waste all your stamina to collect wood, food and water but your tribemates will still be disappointed whether you help or not.
- Your tribemates get annoyed if you don't talk to them. This goes back to a nitpick I had before, they never approach you so all the heavy lifting in every aspect relies on you.
- Immunity Idols. I found one on day 2 and thought I could keep it to the end but it randomly got taken away from me when we merged. 

It's a shallow experience, I've been waiting my whole life for a GOOD Survivor video game, one that can rival the brantsteele simulators but sadly, we'll have to keep waiting. Unless the devs keep working on this which probably won't happen.",1,0
"So, I love this app. I want to recommend it but i have some issues :

- When I start the app, Coco model load. It's okay. But when I try to load Bella or a MMD model from the workshop, I see the logo loading but nothing happen next.....
- I tried to reset my settings first by clicking on reset settings in the menu. After that, Coco model loaded but same problem with loading the other models still remains.
- Then, I renamed Chat folder and theme.js but nothing changed. 
- At last, i tried to update my drivers to the latest, I went on steam to verify all the files of the app. It said that 2 files were missing so Steam downloaded the files again. But my issue doesn't seem to disappear....

"Edited after more game play 9/25/23
Got a little more to go but it is getting there. 
The bad first:
1. The elephant in the room is no doubt the sound. The crowd noise is atrocious, Sunday Rivals which is a fun arcade FB game demolishes this games crowd noise.

2. Commentary. From a NFL 2k05 clone. The really hidious portion being the goofy color commentator making weird arbitrary statements that are 1. wrong 2. stupid and 3. as if he were watching another game on his phone. Ie. The QB gets sacked and he says sometimes you just need to run the ball and pick up a few yards...  er...what?

3. Some pass routes put too many receivers in the same spot and dont have levels of progression.

4. A FEW animation issues but it gets better every year... the main animation flaw being when a RB shoves off a would be tackler he turns his back to the endzone and pushes said tackler to the ground...TOO SLOWLY. This animation could potentially be kept if it just clocked faster.
No stiff arm mechanic.

5. Some AI decision for coaches..but it is a rare bad decision and much better than some games.

6. Cant set lineups, particularly subs...yet

The Good:
A lot of things. While not perfect (but when have we ever had that) Franchise, customize everything, Make teams, uniforms, playbooks ...its all here.

-Nit picks. Defensive players get up off the ground too fast and get in on the tackle.
-Nit ALL animations are good, there is still some stiff animations being pushed by the ball carrier
-Drag routes for 1 deep to the boundary which result in a 1 or 2 yard gain out of bounds.
-Ball carriers dont stiff arm but stop running and push a defender to the ground giving the defense time to close in him.
-no logic in AI play calling. I mean sure down and distance is okay but there is no logic on what is working or not
-no real concept of zone defense..if a defender drops into a zone he is still looking for a PLAYER to cover and not just standing in that area for too long

Is it a Madden killer? No not yet, but it is getting closer every year.

"Edit:  After some time I decided to try this program again.  Honestly, I still feel the price may be a bit high still.  Also I'd recommend getting this only if you have a rigger who knows how to apply this to your model.  Set up is a bit of a pain, and really needs all the additional parameters. 

It does extend the tracking on the face, to make it smoother.  I'm not sure if there was an update since I last tried, but it no longer has lagging issues.

I have mix feelings on this.  I really wanted to love this program. 

Pros: 
Can connect to other iphone programs.
Does enhance the tracking [as long as your model is rigged for it]

Cons:
I found the tracking would hiccup or lose connection
Your model has to be set up for it 
Its rather pricey for the program at this stage. 

I would've like to have had a demo version to try/test out to see how things worked.  The set up was a bit of a pain, and had to end up using ifacialmocap to track as it wouldn't connect to vtube studio mobile.  I tested using TheArtGun's demo model for vtubestudio and my own, which I had rigged in the blendshapes according to their ARKit sheet Bridge Diagram.  I noticed both had the same issue, which the mouth would vibrate a bit (which didnt happen without the vBridger) and there would be times the tracking would stop all together.  The iphone was still tracking it was just between the Vbridger and Vtubestudio.  It could've been lagging the computer or the software, I wasn't running anything else to test which, but either way it shouldn't be doing that on my PC.  The program does enhance the tracking but not enough to warrent the price or set up

Ultimately at this stage I would say its not worth 10 dollars. I believe if both the vbridger and editor were together it would be worth that or even 15, but as it stands now, not really.  I, again, wished there was a demo to try, be it usable for an hour or something just to try it out and see.

I was really excited for this program, and spent the past 3 days rigging up a head to use it. Sadly I think just using the vanilla vtube is fine. It doesn't enhance it enough at this point, and with the weird lag/hiccups I wouldn't be comfortable using it on stream.  I hope in future updates this is fixed and I wish all the best to the devs. I dont want to really downvote but they dont allow wishy washy recommendations and sadly I cant recommend it from my experience.",0,1

"Shockingly good, honestly. I'd say this despite its scope is the best cultivation game I've played and I've played all the big ones. Its got a good variety in options for playstyle, feels mostly pretty fair and while some options are rather overtuned, its not like any feel completely unviable, as is often the case in these games where throw sword or lifesteal tends to be >>>> anything else.
The issues are:

Inconsistent tooltips. Some stats and effects say nothing when moused over. How much damage is '1 base damage'? Its not 1. What does it effect? I don't know. What is 'soul level', how do I grind it? I don't know. Its mostly fine, but some of the most important stats aren't transparent.

As mentioned, some blatantly superior or inferior options. Melee in general has super short range but doesn't do damage to justify this. The best melee weapon by far is ranged and requires a dozen upgrades that just buff it to compete with an average spell. One spell basically makes you invincible. % damage scaling off crit is the only damage buff that matters because of how much higher it is than anything else and % life/spirit steal quicky just restores 100% per hit as you start doing like 10k per hit.
One spell in particular, the upgraded meteor, seems outright bugged. It does '100x meteor damage' (which is absurd itself); this somehow made meteor go from 90 damage a hit to 32k+, 1 shotting over half the game. And that's per meteor. I was throwing 3 or more per cast. 

It has gungeon style combos where having certain weapons/items changes how a specifc item in the 'combo' works, but the only wayto see what works with what is very vague hints and unreadable (as so many weapons are swords or hammers and look similar) silouhettes. 

Personally I just plainly refused to use the uber broken options (demon cultivation healing its entire health per hit, meteor upgrade, turtle shield invul) and the game felt mostly fair like this. If you use any of those, its a joke. I DO use the broken % crit = damage upgrade, because of one of the main balancing issues:
Bosses have more hp than every enemy in their area combined. They're just insanely tanky for no apparent reason, to the point where if you don't have this, they can take minutes to kill despite every enemy already dying in one hit/

Its main issues lie in QoL with like 90% of its content feeling pretty well designed and balanced. Its not a perfect game or anything, but its much, much better than I expected for its price. 
I got it at 20% off which feels fair. 
Full price may be a bit much until they fix the QoL... which they won't do, since they're moving on to the next game. Which I hope is a sequel to this and fixes these issues. At which point I'd pay much more and be happy.",0,1

"Pros:
-New weapons feel great to use.
-New feats make going full tin can very fun.

Cons:
-Intro and story isn't as captivating as The Expedition, locations doesn't feel as visually unique when compared to the rest of the game and The Expedition DLC.
-Patrols are absolutely relentless to the point of tedium, you don't have time to loot or heal before you're bombarded with another group of enemies homing into your position.
-Enemies are frustratingly strong, it makes sense for Strongmen and most Transcendent Surmirbarens to have high health + defense and strong melees because they lack range attacks, you can kite the Surmirbarens or use traps and funnel them into a choke point, Strongmen are easily countered with EMPs or by making them infight with crabs. Exosoldiers have both strong ranged attacks (Single-target and AOE) and survivability, making them an absolute pain to deal with in large group. Using an EMP grenade isn't always viable, because the bot will nullify it like it's casting Counter-Nade', meaning you'll almost always have to waste AP on it first before you can throw an EMP grenade. There seems to be very little weakness for the enemies in this DLC.
-Bland, boring gameplay loop. Like some have pointed out, it's like Deep Cavern, but somehow worse.

TL;DR: Shockingly bad when compared to the main game and The Expedition DLC. 4/10",1,0

I'm down for DLC too. Like challenge runs with new stages and new enemies. Would be great if the terrain and enemy palette changes up a bit, so it's more diverse.

"I had to stop playing this to write this review because my opinion was distracting me from the actual fight and I was getting nothing done. So... Here goes this mixed bag.

I'ma start by saying this is a terrible game. On it's own this is in no way something you will enjoy or find fun. I saw souls-like and thought awesome picturing creating my own character or progressing it... Yeah none of that. I'll explain why I still recommend it with my general process in deaths.

First: Wow this guys hard maybe it'll be that familiar souls-like troupe of impossible starter fight.

Second: Oh I'm actually supposed to win?

Third: Hate + 1

Fourth: Disgust + 1

Fifth: Hate&Disgust + 1

Sixth: Planning a murder.

Seventh: Rationalizing a murder.

Eight: Depression + 1

Ninth: About to give up.

Tenth: Staring at that quit button but still clicks play...

Eleventh: Nothing more then a steaming ball of rage staring at the counter in the bottom of my screen when sudden I freeze over at the familiar sensation of annoyance and determination. The janky controls. The seemingly random gameplay. The repetitive nature. The boredom. The quickly rising numbers in the bottom of my screen. That oh so familar start menu that it throws you out to every time...

THIS IS A FUCKING QUARTER EATER!!!

This is what I mean... It's a fucking terrible game. You won't enjoy a moment of playing it and honestly when you win you'll likely feel an overwhelming sense of depression and emptiness. Even if there's game after this even if it's everything I expected and more... You're probably still done with the game... But if you put it in an arcade? It's perfect. It's the right sense of impossible yet manageable whilst the deaths and frustration quickly stack up with the high definition and detail to the graphics with little to no care to realism and quality... It's just an example of an arcade game at it's finest. Something that can grip your attention hard and drain your token stack but you could totally put down at the drop of a hat because honestly stopping would be a welcome change. 

So don't play this if you are looking to enjoy yourself - If you are thinking of playing something similar to dark souls - Or indeed aren't alone... You are probably gonna lash out in frustration or... Just be a bit of a bitch. If you play it for any extended period of time...

But if you looking for an amusing but deeply annoying quick and easy to abandon romp through a beautiful but stupid otherworldly environment and fight an angel android thing as death... This is a great arcade game for you... Also... If you are highly skilled and learn quickly... Probably stay away. Stubborn emotional and mid range skills is probably gonna make this game the proper experience for you. Cause otherwise I feel it wouldn't be hard to finish what appear to be the only fight in the game in like 3 attempts.... Luck and randomness depending.",0,1

"I have completed full boss rush of all decks. Here are my opinions:

Pros:
1. Great Art, Great Animations and the biggest selling point of the game. One of the reasons I didn't refund. CG's are worth the price of the game. Also. do like you don't have to complete a boss rush to get a cg for a character.
2. Majority of the decks are fun and varied that are able to win.
3. More new content coming that sounds fun.

Cons:
1. No Tutorial. Large heap of text which is a terrible way of doing it as I just found it to be information overload and had no idea what I was doing when I first played. Needs a tutorial.
2. Most likely bad introduction. The first deck I think most people will play Melonies first deck which is a board wipe big damage focuses deck but is a bad a example as it's slow imo and confusing for a new player who doesn't know what to do and can be frustrating to play. I find it can be a struggle to win boss rush with the deck. Better introduction decks are any of the other initial decks or just Deathgrip since it has an assured win condition. 
3. No advice on how to play a deck. All decks are preconstructed so you have no idea what the deck is meant to do. Most are straight forward but even just a sentence tip saying the idea of the deck and the key card would help a lot. I used a steam guide for tips on how to play and it was great.
4. 2 Decks are unbalanced imo. Melonie first deck needs a small tweak to not so slow. Last of red girls decks is almost an auto loss against Melonie I find as this deck can't heal (interesting idea) and can get overwhelmed by her high damage cards. This is really frustrating after playing through 2 rounds and finding her last. If playing this deck keep rolling until you face her first to get her out of the way. The rest you should have a good chance for (didn't lost anyone else with that deck. 
5. 1 deck is downright awful and needs to be reworked. I almost refunded the game because of this deck. Its 3rd girl's first (forest?) cat deck. The gimmick is you need to generate yourself milk cards that give you mana to use your spells. The problem is this is really as most of the deck is spells that need mana and the constant generation of milk cards clogs your hands as they waste your draws. You can destroy them to get rid of them but there goes your mana supply. The main issue with this deck is Deathgrip. I found it impossible to beat any version of her that isn't litch because litch's minions fix your resource issue by giving you mana when they die.  The other two just overwhelm you with minions as this deck is horrible at large swarms enemies and the one splash spell it has is awkward and useless mostly I find. Needs to be entirely reworked imo to include more splash cards and minion destroying cards to stop your opponent overwhelming you while also getting closer to an auto win.",0,1

The free level and the forest level were the most interesting for me, the other two fell a bit flat.",1,0

"Everybody has that ONE game. A game so influential to them that it manages to sculpt and shape their views on what multiplayer gaming is supposed to be. For a lot of people, it is Halo, Counter-Strike or Call of Duty, just to name a few. For me, it was this game right here, [b]Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory[/b]. So influential in fact that this game partially helped shape my gamer nickname I use in almost every game and gaming platform. 

You can guess where I got the other half.

So, what's so special about this game? It's pretty much Team Fortress in WW2, it has very little to do with Wolfenstein beyond just being a generic WW2 setting and while the tone is decisively serious, almost imediately it turns comedically silly with all the voice lines (especially the german ones) and people bunnyhopping all over the place, not to mention the gratuitous amount of gore and gibs when using explosives and mortars.

This game was meant to be an expansion for Return to Castle Wolfenstein (fantastic game BTW), but for one reason or another, Splash Damage decided to release this game for free and completely stand-alone from the base game. Growing up as a broke teenager, this game was an absolute blessing and even when I started buying games with my own earned money, I still played the heck out of this one for a long while.

The original 2003 release only had 6 maps in total, but the WolfET community got up to the task of making even more maps, including porting the ones from RTCW, there's simply no shortage of maps to choose from, depending on your favorite server of course.

This game is one of many that used the old GameSpy services and unfortunately it got shut down a long time ago. Fortunately the community has managed to keep this game alive by rebuilding a master server list (look for [b]ET Legacy[/b]) and plenty of people willing to host their own servers, sometimes it feels like a different game with each server using a different set of mods and map rotation lists.

So, is it worth playing this game? ABSOLUTELY! ... With a caveat of course. First, this game won't work right out of the box, you need to install [b]ET Legacy[/b], not only does it revive the master server list, but it also brings many QoL improvements like a proper Alt+Tab command (the original famously didn't have such a thing), higher resolution and framerate support, better audio and many more MUCH needed improvements.

Second, your XP progress is entirely server dependent, it doesn't get saved account wise like in most multiplayer games and if you're hopping from server to server, you must be willing to start all over again in every new server you visit. It's not a big deal in my opinion, you can still be completely competitive at level 1, but you can definitely have more advantages and cooler weapons at higher levels.

And lastly, don't take this game too seriously, have fun, embrace the silliness and play this game to your heart's content, it's completely free and it most certainly runs on your kitchen fridge above 120 FPS.",0,1

"It's a a prologue to a medieval story set in England, I highly suggest using saveeditonline.com or another save editor to cut the boring grind of playing in the highest difficulty and dying over and over again to start again with marginal improvements. The gameplay consists of picking activities in your army camp, each activity passes a bit of time and after time runs out you get a battle. The battles are typical turn based combat and it's fairly fleshed out, you can use different weapons, aim for different limbs and use things like poison to debuff enemies.

The good/pros: it's a fairly interesting if not wholly innovative story, your character is a young son of a small merchant near London, gets into a fight where the sheriff's son lies dead, so he flees from the hanging and joins an army going north to fight the Scots and their allied French. You meet a couple of characters and ultimately have to choose how to interact with them. If you like the setting, it's a pretty decent if short story.

The bad/cons: Personally, I hated the combat and checks of skill during events. Sure, the combat is kinda wide with all the weapons, stats, attacks and defenses, but it's ultimately shallow and you either grind a lot or set it to easy. There is a lot of RNG as well when it comes to your equipment, both from the available stock on the camp's mechant and to the loot you get. The best gear for me was a big shield and an one handed pike, but in most runs I couldn't quite get kitted out. Specially because looting dead enemies drains your virtue stat, kind of like your morality meter that comes into play sometimes. So, again, use an online save editor, max out your stats and then you don't need to worry about passing RNG checks. The alternative is playing on the highest difficulty, where each death gives you a couple of points to spend next time. I say the number checks should be scrapped, instead let players choose what they want and show the outcome, don't extend your gameplay with useless grinding.

Finally, the story is just the prologue, ultimately your arc is to realize that of the downfall mentioned in the title. You are just a cog in a war machine now, this is your life, you cannot go back home ever again or you will hang. If anything, it could have easily been a Ren'Py visual novel, specially because the choices are not going to really carry through to the next part. [spoiler] You will be used, betrayed by most people and those that don't betray you are going to end up dead. So the only people left are those you either want to kill or flee from, one of which appears as the last boss all of a sudden is implied to become your target for revenge.[/spoiler] You are also going to lose pretty much everything you own, so the next game can start you from zero anyway.",0,1

"[h1] A mess of a review: [/h1]

[u] Tl,dr: [/u]

There's potential here, but development seems slow. I'd wait a bit after the full release to see if the game arrives in a somewhat finished and polished state.

[u] First concerns: [/u]

Having played the Demo that came out in June of 2022, before this Prologue, I'm a bit worried about the development of this game. The Prologue felt like a slightly more enhanced version of the Demo (with added day/night cycle, some more recipes and objects to place), which makes it seem like the game didn't come very far in that year.
On top of that the game currently is still in a fairly buggy state; I had to repeat days because the tutorials broke on me several times, one day I just couldn't finish because the ""go home"" objective never popped up, plates seem to multiply on their own and so on.
Another point of concern is the lack of the multiplayer. Sure this is just a Prologue, however I'm concerned that the developers are struggling with the actual implementation of the multiplayer in the game, which in my personal opinion, would be the biggest selling point of this game.

[u] Mechanics: [/u]

The addition of the service counters is a bit questionable in my opinion, since you make one dish and somehow you can serve 4 of them, which kind of takes away from the cooking aspect of the game.
Washing dishes is novel at first but maybe the addition of a dishwasher would be a good idea to automate this task so the player can focus more on the actual cooking.
The build mode, although a little basic, is fun and lets you customize your own restaurant quite well.
Cooking is fun. Let the player do more of that please.
Somehow the restaurant gets miraculously trashed overnight, it would be nicer if you would see the floors get dirty throughout the day or you have customers litter throughout the day, rather than a trash heap spawning in the restaurant overnight.
There is a progression system in the game and it seem to work fairly fine.
You can make pies and so on, however for some reason you have to free-place the crust into the tray in individual slices, which can get a bit finicky. I'd prefer either putting the entire crust at once or allowing the player to snap them into place.
I had customers come in and get annoyed at me for not having enough tables, although 20 seats were free/each customer wanted a separate table for some reason.

[u] Summary: [/u]

Despite the current shortcomings of the game i still see the same potential here that the demo had. Cooking, Customization and serving customers are all fun. There are bugs but those can be fixed. I'm not sure whether or not I can recommend this game at this point. Going by the current state of this prologue I'd say no, development seemed fairly slow and there was too little communication from the devs throughout the last year. By the looks of it multiplayer hasn't been implemented yet either. However there is so much potential here to make an actual fun co-op cooking simulator. On a side note the devs should maybe think about adding VR support to this game too, as this could easily become the best VR cooking game, especially once the multiplayer works. However, the prologue was playable and despite the bugs I had fun, especially when the tutorials wouldn't restrict what I was doing anymore.",0,1

[B][U]This review was made while the game was free (before patch 1.0.6 - July 29th). I plan to update it soon, consider it out of date until then.[/u][/b]

[h1][u]Synopsis[/u][/h1]
[i]Burial Stone[/i] is a medieval-fantasy first person grid-&-turn-based RPG that requires a VR headset and motion controllers to play. It contains fantasy violence, some blood, and comically over-sized bones spread throughout the dungeon's levels. It can be rather quiet, leading to an eerie sensation of being alone. There's very little in the way of music, and no story to speak of. During my time, I didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs, but one achievement seems to be bugged (Entered Boss Hall). The weapons might also be unselected in the menu despite being visually equipped, but I didn't notice this having an adverse effect on gameplay. The final screen is also far too long, and could use a skip button, or be shortened.

[h1][u]In and out, quicker than you'd think[/u][/h1]
[u][b]Introduction[/b][/u]
It makes me feel like a monster to not recommend. It's free, so you're not losing anything financially. However, you are devoting your time while playing it as opposed to any numerous other tasks or games you could be playing. If the game had something going for it, a novelty of some kind, I would give it an immediate thumbs up. This is clearly a passion project being soldiered by most likely one person. Which is highly unfortunate, as there is nary a thing I can recall for the hour of playing that warrants a download. It's lacking in a lot of fundamental ways, and what is present is rather cumbersome, and to be honest, not very well implemented.

[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]
This game doesn't feel particularly fun to play. Movement in a grid-based game locks you to the board, and this restriction can breed innovative design. In Burial Stone, it simply limits the player with no benefit, other than preventing the player from running into walls or getting stuck against the scenery. The UI doesn't play nice while moving either, which can be annoying when you just want to click on a healing item while on the go.

Combat is clunky and unrewarding, highly RNG based on whether you hit, and how devastating you are. You'll watch in dismay as one of your skills or spells fails to produce any meaningful damage if it hits. When it doesn't, you've wasted mana, and the enemy may have struck you with considerable damage. Which results in you fumbling your next turn to chug a healing item or potion, which can be very rare early on. Almost every enemy is functionally the same, minus some status effects or use of range weaponry, both from singular entities. It's all very bland and straightforward, even the final boss lacks in mechanical depth.

All this leading to the biggest disappointment, the interactivity. VR has its place in gaming, wherein most games are going to be short and provide some level of gameplay immersion inaccessible without the headset. Pulling levers, swinging swords, and physically leaning around corners are all elements that are gimmicky in nature, but are satisfying in their own way. None of this is present in any capacity. You click on skills to make your next attack do that. You click on levers to make them open doors. You click on items in menus to buy, use or equip them (if the game doesn't do that for you sometimes). The game totes that your only source of light is the torch, but it might as well be light emanating from you to begin with, because it's never used in any meaningful manner. It calls into question why it even needed to be a VR game, it would've work about as well not in VR.

All this, yet I can still see the potential here, a lot of ideas that need exploring to flesh out the game into something that could honestly be rather enjoyable and unique. A lot of VR tends to require the player to be constantly active, it's nice when one comes along that plays at the pace of the player's decisions.

[h1][u]Dungeon Crawling Core Value[/u][/h1]
Burial Stone is a dungeon crawler defined by the older, classical descriptive used to identify a type of game from the 80s/90s; a grid-based first person rpg, sometimes referred to as a gridder, or blobber if it contains more than one actively controlled protagonist. The inherit core value of the experience is, in my opinion, a level 2.

""The game contains dungeons and/or dungeon-like environments that serves the purpose of scenery or change of scenery. The environment has little significance, but overall attempts to present a dungeon crawling experience in some way other than purely/entirely cosmetic.""

The whole experience is an immersive one to a degree, and can often feel rather eerie in the silence, with only the sounds of your torch breaking up the quiet. However, the lack of interactivity hurts it greatly. It's like a horror house where you get to see the things, but always keep a modest distance from them.

[h1][u]Final Thoughts[/u][/h1]
I didn't want this is come off so negative. In the end, it's free. If you want to give it a shot and have a VR headset, there's nothing really stopping you. It's an hour of your time, and if you feel like it's worth marveling at a passion project, then don't let me stop you. It's a quaint game, and you might enjoy it. Heck, it could be the inspiration you need to start your own project.",1,0

"Brutal old-school difficulty packed in cute little aesthetics.

The game opts for minimalistic art and basic color. If the default colors aren't to your liking, there are other color templates available in the options. Some are too bright for my taste, but a few are exactly ideal for the game. 

The gameplay is typical of a platformer, featuring jumping and attacking. There is no tutorial, but I wish there was one to teach you about unique abilities. These are in limited supply and utilize animals with special attacks. All three feel completely useless because of weak attacks.

Despite its attractive looks and appearance, the game is as tough as nails. Although you can pick between lower and higher difficulty levels, normal is the best way to receive the whole experience. In any case, there isn't much of a difference because it simply affects the damage you receive.

The majority of the annoyance stems from knockback and instant death when falling into pits. When both are present, death always follows. There are way too many situations in which you must jump on platforms, but contact with an enemy knocks you into a hole. Naturally, enemy placement is ideal for this to occur. There are, thankfully, checkpoints.

The game's balance needs to be improved. I frequently just rushed to the next checkpoint or took an intentional hit that grants you a second of invincibility to get through a difficult section. Another disadvantage is that your character's attack is very weak. 

You'll have to kill cute animals like butterflies, cats, and frogs. They can, however, take multiple hits and attack relentlessly. While attacking in the air is okay, attacking on the ground prevents you from moving for a split second. As you might expect, bosses have attacks that require fast reaction. Second and fourth boss are unplayable because of fast random attacks that are impossible to dodge. I had to rely on a another secret move; press up and jump.

If you choose to delete your save file when on stage 2 and restart the game, you may encounter a glitch. The new file will begin in Chapter 2 and will display a white screen, rendering the game unplayable. This can be resolved by exiting and restarting the game.

The game is still in early access and doesn’t cost much, but I would recommend this only to those who are familiar with old-school experience that borders on unfair. It's not fun for anyone else.",0,1

"OK, this IS early access, so some problems are normal (in my original review, I mistakenly thought it was in 1.0.)  Some of the gameplay is pretty cool, but the repetitiveness is getting pretty obvious and I don't see a good way out.  I'm willing to reconsider this review later, but here are some of the issues I've got:

-What is the purpose of having to click a button to buy fuel?  Is it JUST to irritate the player?  There is no audio notification that fuel is low until your tractors just disappear--fun.  The fuel thing is also superfluous: I have never once considered whether I should buy fuel--I just buy as much as I can.  Fuel costs vary, sure, but once I start using tractors, I'm just going to buy fuel no matter what.  (You could perhaps improve this by showing the cost of fuel in the top bar instead of in the tooltip, but even then I doubt high fuel prices would ever make me think twice.)  You want to make some tractors more expensive to use, I get it, but just make this a cost per tile traversed or something.
  
-The contracts give the game a frenetic nature--especially since you're constantly slamming me with my options.  Thanks for allowing me to opt out of this, but now the choice is between forgetting that I should be taking contracts or being constantly reminded that there are some contracts available that I don't want.  You apparently want me to use cover crops, but the contract mechanic pushes me not to do this.  [Update: OK, this is more of a gameplay/style issue--just ignore contracts until you want them now.  Still, that makes contracts poorly integrated into gameplay.]

-The game is optimized REALLY poorly.  I didn't by BG3 or a top-of the line FPS.  I purchased a game that features tractors slowly moving across the screen and crops growing...slowly.  The opening menu is a slideshow.  The. Opening. Menu.  Gameplay is OK up to about 400 plots and then it's a slideshow.  Sure, I don't have a high-end computer, but I also bought a game about, you know, farming. [Update: I turned ALL graphic settings to low.  Feels bad, man.]

-Furthermore, if I fail a contract, is it taking the resources I put toward the contract?  I haven't paid close enough attention, but if this is so, then is there a reason to take contracts past early game?

-Chickens appear to eat the crops AND seeds I plant in the pens.  This is...immersive...but from a gameplay perspective, why would I want this?  The egg/honey contracts get me $500 a pop--am I supposed to get excited about this when other contracts could get me $100,000? (For those of you who think I'm exaggerating, I'm not.)  Furthermore, why is there always a honey/eggs contract past early game eating up a spot for the more lucrative contract? [Note: This last issue seems fixed] 

-Is there an endgame here?  What am I supposed to be excited about that will keep me playing?",0,1

[h1] REVIEW [/h1]
[b]  Dolmenjord [/b] is a Casual Sorting Puzzle game.  

There is no setup story for the game. All of the puzzles deal with placing tiles on a board of different sizes and making sure all pieces fit on the map.  There is the added complexity of specific pieces either needing to connect to each other or face a certain way to be considered a complete map.

The game is very complicated in later stages unless you use the hint feature to show how to place the boardwalk. Play time is ~1 hour to get all achievements, and ~3-5 hours to beat all maps. There are a total of 60 puzzles to solve. There is NO replayability on this game as there is no end game mechanics, no map metrics to try to beat, and no engrossing story to return to. I recommend this game to anyone that likes casual games or is an achievement hunter.",0,1
"The game is awesome, however there is one problem. Its sort of dead. I checked the steam charts and there are about 2 hours a day when the game has 30-40 players, which is barely enough to fill one lobby, also considering that multiple lobbies will be playing at the same time, might have 4 games with 5 people in each.

I know the devs are happy with the game the way it is and dont plan to update it but they can really fix this game, it has so much potential. Making it free to play would gather many many players. I also think it lacks some sort of progression system, or even a cosmetic system. Right now the game has no point, you just play till you get bored with no reward. Some kind of cosmetic store that can be used with currency from wins would make the game fun and get people playing it more, or a leveling/rank system just to display a number next to your name that goes up with xp from kills and wins, special textures and patterns you can buy aside from the regular boring colours. These kinds of things would really liven up the game along with the players seeing it free to play and jumping on.

This game has so much potential and I love playing it, even if the lobby is 2v2. I would recommend buying it but first checking steam charts to see if the game is populated at a good time for you. Happy Gaming :)",0,1

Prices for things in this game are on the absurd side. I'll give an example... VIP status (which is like your sub) is $25 a WEEK. That's $100 a month plus they basically have a battle pass in this for the current season to get top tier extra rewards, they charge you for premium crates (upwards of $50) and you can outright but just about every in game currency in small quantity for $5-10 ... and THEN you have your typical mobile gatchas which you can pay real money to get more. Of course you can pay for them...

All of that would be 'okay-ish' with me for a FREE experience, but that leads me to my next point:

2) This isn't really a daily pop in and pop out game. There's actual substance, boobs are the reward which I really like. What I dislike and why its a deal breaker for me? I have to really keep this thing up all day and baby sit it every few hours just to maintain the basic gameplay loops it has (on the free side). A new day turns  over and I need to sink a good hour in it to get the basic stuff done. That's too much of a time-sink for this gamer and likley an unrealistic ask for casual gamers.

I wanted a fun and sexy little side thing to run on my 2nd monitor that isn't resource demanding whiile Cookie Clicker is going. Something I can kinda do when I play my MMO, do work, research, or watch movies. Can I realistically see myself hardcore playing this for even 40 mins a day? No. I simply cannot. If I had an extra budget of $5,ooo to blow on whale hunting games I do not think I would put it in this one either.

I was looking forward to this becoming 'my thing' but after 7 days of seeing how the gaming loop plays out? They need to redesign this to respect the players time if they want it to last. Also, if anyone spends $10,ooo USD on this (which I think might actually be possible) they deserve the right to be left outside with no laptops or phones for a week.

"Hark, ye gentlefolk, lend me thine ears, For a tale of a game so vile, it bringeth tears. A game so wretched, so utterly dire, It maketh Bubonic Plague seem but a mere quagmire.

I speak of a game called Bung Ball, A digital ordeal, a mind's grand sprawl, Where graphics resemble a child's crayon art,And sounds echo like a banshee's piercing dart.

The gameplay, oh dear, it doth surpass all bounds, A repetitive loop, where madness abounds, Thou shalt mash buttons and keys till thy fingers grow sore, While thy brain cells slowly wither and die, evermore.

I ventured into this digital abyss, Seeking solace, a moment of bliss, But alas, I found myself trapped in a mire, A monotonous vortex, a soul's dire fire.

My PC groaned, its fans whirring loud, As it struggled to bear this game's horrid shroud, Mine ears bled from the cacophony so shrill, While mine eyes glazed over, mine vision turned nil.

Yet, I persisted, a masochist's delight, Driven by curiosity, a morbid spite, I'd conquer this game, this digital foe, Or it would surely consume me, you know.

Through levels I trudged, my spirit forlorn, Mine will waning, mine hope slowly torn, The game mocked me, its laughter so cruel, As I stumbled and fumbled, a hapless fool.

Finally, I reached the end, or so I did believe, A glimmer of hope, a victory to conceive, But alas, the game tricked me, a cruel twist so sly, There was no ending, just an endless loop to defy.

I was trapped, a prisoner of this digital hell, Forever doomed to play, my fate to dwell, In Bung Ball's clutches, my sanity lost, A cautionary tale, a lesson at cost.

So heed mine warning, dear friends so dear, Unless thou seekest madness, thy mind to sear, Avoid Bung Ball, its clutches so tight, Or thou shalt join me in this eternal night.

Pee pee poo poo.

"Quite a refreshing experience on RPG Maker games. Its charm lies in its simplicity, good OST, classic and entertaining gameplay, and the manga-style graphics add a distinctive twist to the game. Bottom line, it's a game well made. Why the thumbs down, then? Because the game's mosaic'd, even with the official patch. This is actually an issue with Wasabi Entertainment games, that doesn't bother to provide a restored version for international players like Kagura Games does. Such a shame...",1,0

"When I first played Rat Clan I thought it was terrible, it felt entirely too weak with way more downsides than upsides, and I across multiple games I was always struggling for enough food. I kept trying though, and now Clan of the Rat is my favorite clan to play. 
It doesn't change the game like Dragon or Kraken, just uses the base game mechanics to create an entirely new play perspective, where the villagers themselves are more of a resource than they're ever been. Go heavy into food production and mining rock to upgrade to food production buildings, and choose Overcrowding as your first or second perk, and you won't have problems with food again (as long as you have a decent spawn point). I used to cringe at the loss of every villager from wolf attacks with other clans, now you immediately have ones to replace. Production low? Overwork, kill off the villagers whose health is too low to recover in a reasonable amount of time. I love the ability of Eir and the shamans to heal themselves on long conquests and guerilla attacks across the map so you don't have to eternally return to your own territory to heal. It's great for hit and run raids and by the time you build up you can get your pyre monster to tank damage for you. 
It's also nice you can Overwork at any time, not like Feasts where you have to save up more and more food every time. 

Is it the most powerful clan, no. But the large number of rapidly appearing villagers allow you to dump them into whatever victory path you've decided, so in my opinion it's more versatile. 
I also like how you don't have to use Houses, and now when I go back to other clans it's frustrating that I lose so many building slots to them XD 

Not for everyone I guess, but I'm a fan.",0,1
"Not bad to kill a few hours, just not a particularly good vore game either. The last game in the collection isn't worth playing tho, just do the first five and ignore the sixth one. It's a bad ending to the story and the fighting mechanics are frustrating as hell.  Also, shame on you for not giving an ending with Liv in that one chapter.",0,1

"In general not a horrible game.  
The graphics can be frustrating when it looks like a player is out of bounds and still makes a catch or players just seem to stand there as the opposition run past.
But, my biggest problem with this game is when in coach mode you call a play and that is not what is run.  Specifically, on kickoffs.  I've played numerous games when I was ahead in the last 2 minutes of the game and the other team predictably called an onside kick - I would call for onside kick return and yet my team would always lineup all on one side (away from where the ball was going) - or Even Worse, I would try to adjust for this and call for a regular kickoff return and they would STILL lineup in an onside kick return with ALL of the players on the wrong side of the field.

Very frustrating to play for an hour, be ahead by 17 points with less than 2 minutes to go, only to lose.",1,0
