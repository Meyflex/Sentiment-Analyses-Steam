"Harvey Randall wrote an article for PC Gamer calling this a ""six hour long one-shot campaign"". In reality, this is about the size of any regular world in Remnant 2, as it IS a regular world that already existed in game. There isn't much that's new, but what is new is fantastic, namely the bosses. It really shouldn't take you six hours to complete a run of this, unless you're blasted drunk or, like Harvey, a games journalist.",1,0

"Claustrophobia the game, beating this nightmare gave me a new perspective on life, anything better than being stuck in the tiny tunnels. It feels like the world-building is intentionally empty or lacking the character to create a feeling of uncomfortable space and anxiety. It slightly reminded me of HellNight for PS1, mostly because 90% of this game is moving through tiny tunnels and almost no visibility, it's almost like playing as a food that is moving through an intestine, and I have to say game was extremely immersive, I figured it had no monsters early on, but sometimes I felt like I had to look behind my back because it's just so weird.

That said, I must give a bit of a warning for anyone that wants to try it, the navigation in this game is not exactly friendly, there is a huge exploration area with low visibility, and the layout of the map is not good for orientation. I can't tell you how many times I missed a path because I just could not see it or walked in a complete circle. It got so hard I was considering drawing my personal map, eventually, I managed to memorize the layout, but it took a few hours. On top of that, some of the puzzles and mechanics require a little bit of imagination, the game does not hold your hand, so expect a bit of challenge there as well.

(If I can give a small piece of advice for playing this game, have paper and pencil ready, and hug every wall, all of them, hug every wall that you see because you will miss something).

For me to explain exactly how this game works might be a bit of a spoiler in itself, I think part of the charm of this game is figuring out how the 2 character mechanics interact together. It can be a bit confusing at first, but once you understand the basic idea, the game is not very complicated. Essentially you have a tall character and a small robot that goes into tiny places you can't go, and that is more or less the core of the game. Interestingly the game has some point&click elements combined with a first-person exploration, sometimes it's not intuitive because the robot can press certain things that are out of his range.

So my save file said I beat the game around 90 minutes, but the actual time was closer to 4 hours or so, and even that might be a bit optimistic, there are so many ways to get stuck. There are at least 3* endings (that I know), probably about 6-7 hours with no hints.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

(+) Now, I can't imagine this game will resonate with many people, but it reminded me of those dreadful games such as HellNight, and unfortunately, I have some nostalgia for games that make you navigate endless tunnels where you can't see much of anything. I am actually not a big fan of games that are too dark, I avoid them if anything, but it feels like that design choice here was not just the lack of effort, but an intentional decision to create an uncomfortable and immersive game, I have never seen someone commit to that feeling of emptiness and just constant claustrophobia so much, outside of games like Isolania or Lost in Vivo.

What I am trying to say, I am not sure if people will appreciate the mood and vibes of this game, I think there is a bit of an acquired taste there, but I personally really enjoyed the atmosphere, very unapologetic **** the player, find the way yourself. 

(+) So for the puzzles, I guess you can look at it 2 ways. Yea, they can be kinda frustrating, but I thought the game was very unique as well, if you can inspect the hints carefully, it's not too hard, and I liked thinking outside the box. You definitely want to pay attention and record anything you find, and memorize the areas as well.

(+) There were some parts of the level design that felt more immersive, moving through constantly small spaces and the overall changing perspective made the game feel very different. I do think you could have done a better job with the overall layout, I think the game is very difficult to navigate for the first few hours. 

(+) Multiple endings, I found 3 

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

[u] Nitpicks [/u] - might want to adjust the elevator controls, you can't interact with it if you are too close, and you have to finish moving in one direction before moving again. Also, if you run out of the elevator, you can softlock yourself. There are a bunch of areas where you can escape the map, mostly any joints between the areas. For one of the harder puzzles, the one with the 3x3, I didn't get the logic for the second hint, solved it with 50%+brute forcing. 

[u] Navigation [/u] - um, so in this case I actually like that  you designed the game around tiny places and crawling all over the place, the only thing that annoyed me is that some paths are just not visible at all if you moving around, you very much have to hug the walls here. Maybe at least a small object to point the player into the hard-to-see areas, use those random neons more.

And a small note for the ending, I mean I like that you left it for the player to interpret, but I don't know, I expected just a bit more context considering the treacherous journey.

[b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 [/b]

This is the game that will probably make you angry a few times, but also a rewarding game to beat because of how challenging it is to navigate, almost like you escaped from an endless nightmare. I probably enjoyed this game more than a person with objective reasoning would,  it reminds me of certain elements that I don't see very often,  the game feels very unapologetic with navigation and overall experience, and if you give it a chance it can be very moody. The puzzle mechanics were very creative and maybe a bit frustrating, but they are not hard if you can think outside the box. I played many games that were similar, but not this committed to just having so many tiny places to crawl into, so I kinda enjoyed the whole turd-in-tunnel gameplay.

"So far Im really liking what Im seeing. Very much factorio meets stardew valley (though I havn't seen any 'farming' as of yet, its all collecting).

Theres some minor QoL things Id like to see, the biggest being that building in shop automatically pulling mats from storage chests, a boost to move speed or more fast travel options, and a farther build/interact while in the shop.

But Early Access so lotta stuff Im sure will get improved as we go!

"Not gonna lie I was a bit disappointed by this title. 

While all the designs are nice and the girls are all very busty. We don’t get much content outside of the Main two on the cover. Sure they’re hot but I feel like there could have been like more content for the third female character in the game since they were the main driving force of the story. Also spoilers for one of the endings they have two new random girl designs that could have been used for more content for the game but all they do is just make the ending different from the other one.

And as with most Cherry Kiss Works this game contains a lot of Water Sports to where even one of the character straight up eats food that’s been pissed on. Normally I’m not bothered by the amount of WS with Cherry Kiss games but this one nearly broke me a bit.

Overall if you’re a Cherry Kiss fan or aren’t bothered by WS then you have nothing to worry about, tho you might feel a little underwhelmed from the potential it could have been.",0,1

"I am a 52 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing Thyria: Step Into Dreams. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son found this game at Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. Loaded into the game world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

"If you get this package,
when you can select your tier 4 ship,
take the Hermes carrier, it's worth the most credits to sell.

The price tag for this package though: WAY HIGH.
Tier 2 premium ship with no special permanent camo, and 6-point commander are the key features.

I think the package should include the unique Combat Veteran camouflage for the tier 2 Albany, that might justify this price.
But again, the camo adds nothing but cosmetic appearance.
It would, however, add to the uniqueness of getting this package, if it included that unique camo for the ship (the companies won't lose any money, because there is no other option to buy that camo).

I only recently started playing, so was not here when the Steam patches and icons were able to be earned, 
so yeah, whatever on those. 
Cosmetic only.

Most players won't play tier 2 very long anyway, 
and Albany, and its Pan American twin Alte Abreu, 
do not appear to be the most impressive ships at tier 2, so there's that.

I got it just for the sake of having it, 
and being a newer player, 
the extra economic boosters and signal flags are useful to move up ranks for other ships, faster.

Also for the price, 
it wouldn't kill their profit margin if they would've given 1, 2, or 3 days of premium time with it, too.

The odd part about the Albany, 
its secondary guns are smaller caliber than its main guns, 
but the secondary guns fire slower. 
Literally every other cruiser in the game with secondary guns a smaller caliber than the main guns, 
the secondary guns fire faster: it makes sense: smaller caliber guns have lighter shells the gun crews would load faster.
This ship seems to almost be a forgotten travesty of how NOT to put a ship in the game.

Sure, get it for your collection, for historic nostalgia, and the commander.
But doubtful you'll play it much. It just feels kinda broken with the secondary guns firing slower.

Again, like everything else, NEVER buy it at its full price shown: only buy these when there's a sale discount.",0,1

"I like educational games but [i]Pelagos[/i] is not something I expected to see (or sea, to use a pun, which pelagos means anyway as it is a Greek word). The video on the store page showcases an underwater level with lots of species we can look at and - as per the description - we can photograph.

This is all fine but, unfortunately, the relaxing music is not present in the actual game, at all. Movement is also automatic which means you cannot really have an immersive experience and within a couple of minutes the level simply ends. And this movement is what makes you believe the fishes move - they are, in fact, not but all of them are in a still position.

But what exactly can you photograph? Well, shrimps, eels, fishes and even sea horses. Taking a photo is only possible when the crosshair appears (the description of the gameplay in the settings menu wrongly states ""crossheir"" - there is not much text available; I don't like when devs skip proofreading) but it is not explained that the right mouse button will need to be pressed for this.

Also, why are there numbers appearing next to the names? Sea horse 3: does it mean there are 3 different species to be found and I have just found number 3? When all this ended I went to the gallery to see the photos taken but the game abruptly crashed. Verifying the game files and rebooting my PC did not help.

Do we see the photos only? Or is there a description as to what, for instance, the Garibaldi fish is like? It would also be good to know what the ""Kelp Forest"" is - this is the only level we can pick while the others are ""coming soon"". Not recommended until it is fixed or expanded upon.",1,0

4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1,0

"[h1]Infinity Strash - a Dragon Quest Rogue-lite? [/h1]

So Infinity Strash isn't a bad game but it's likely badly marketed and maybe a bit mismanaged - it could have been a great Rogue-lite Dragon Quest, it partially is. Now it's mostly an average fun action game, for a small niche audience that misses even their target audience due to most of the fun content being barred behind late/endgame.

After I've read a lot of them, unfortunately I think reviews do no justice for the game and most of them seem very lazy - that make the situation even worse.

I for one think the game is actually pretty good, a fantastic love-letter and an above-average action hack and slash that has a poorly executed beginning and scares players away before it gets really fun.

[b] ( Campaign ) [/b]

The Campaign and the Story is just unfortunately mediocre no matter if you are an old-time fan of the Anime/Manga or a complete newcomer - the bulk of the story ( 90% ) is told in still images and vignettes, skipping important fights and context, so story if anything is mostly nostalgia for those who love it but even then...you're better off watching the anime if you have the option for that.

The small amounts of in-engine cutscenes though are absolutely gorgeous and amazing and you should definitely NOT skip those - I loved them all and they capture the story perfectly, which is why it's a shame the majority are vignettes.

The beginning is going to be very easy and gives terrible first impressions but Boss Fights and Combat gets fairly challenging after a few chapters and you really have to use your Perfect Dodges, Blocks and Abilities perfectly to win fights, so I would say the combat gets quite fun and I haven't seen the post-game Challenge Mode yet that sounds like a NG+.

Sadly this beginning is a typical JRPG that is handholding too much and scares away players with overly basic early game.

Nevertheless, I think one of the best parts of Infinity Strash is the amount of love that went into the Monster Design and the general Character design of it as if you are a DQ fan and listen and look for the details - each character and monster has excellent sound and visual design that I'd say is on par with any Main Dragon Quest Title and while the rest of the game is low budget - you can see a lot of love that went into making this!

The Campaign is roughly a 10 hours experience if you decide to skip all the vignette recaps and only watch cutscenes and play the game - roughly twice as much, 20 hours if you watch everything!

BUT, I would say the campaign and the story is just the tutorial to the game and the LARGE majority of the content is the challenge mode AND the Temple of Recollection ROGUE-LITE mode - especially after completing the Main Story once, that unlocks even more extra content and layers in the Temple.


[b] ( Rogue-Lite Content ) [/b]

Yes I think Infinity Strash was likely designed to be a Rogue-lite Dragon Quest but a campaign was attached to it for whatever reason, maybe to increase price...or to have a story-based nostalgic factor, I don't know but I think that part is mostly wasted, but that's just me.

Even the game's story is all about collecting Dai's Memory I think it was pointless to make it a story-based action game and should have just focused 100% on the Temple of Recollection and make this game a proper fun Rogue-lite experience, since it already can be one - but misses the mark due to lots of filler content in Story / Challenge Mode that's just not as enjoyable.

[b]The Temple offers:[/b]

- Randomized Battles
- Party Builds / Combos / Synergies
- Rogue-lite progression for skills / abilities
- Character Builds
- Basic Roguelike Ability / Stat Boosting each Floor
- Fast paced mindless-fun action combat
- Post-game extra abilities and skills
- Solo/Duo Challenges
- Super Bosses

[b] ( TLDR ) [/b]

Infinity Strash is a wonderful nostalgic experience to return to the Adventures of Dai, but the storytelling isn't good for veterans nor for newcomers due to rushed pacing, but the in-game cutscenes show how much love went into creating it and what it could have been with a higher bugdet.

Because the Temple of Recollection is actually fun, I would recommend the game but I can't agree with the $60 Price on it - but if you'd like a simple Action Hack and Slash with Rogue-lite experience in Dragon Quest coating - I think you can get it here, just get past the story and enjoy the rest of the content!

"Pros:
Cool completion animations.
Nice models and worlds, specifically the car and mall.

Cons:
-Added more dlc-only achievements. (Requiring you to buy the dlc to 100% again)
-Very short, took about 2 hours to finish all jobs. (Car job took like a few minutes)
-Considering the amount of the dlc content vs the price, not all that worth it.
-Intern Story doesn't live up to prior dlc in comparison.
-No custom washer or arm model. (Unlike the Spongebob dlc)",1,0
"Pros:
-New weapons feel great to use.
-New feats make going full tin can very fun.

Cons:
-Intro and story isn't as captivating as The Expedition, locations doesn't feel as visually unique when compared to the rest of the game and The Expedition DLC.
-Patrols are absolutely relentless to the point of tedium, you don't have time to loot or heal before you're bombarded with another group of enemies homing into your position.
-Enemies are frustratingly strong, it makes sense for Strongmen and most Transcendent Surmirbarens to have high health + defense and strong melees because they lack range attacks, you can kite the Surmirbarens or use traps and funnel them into a choke point, Strongmen are easily countered with EMPs or by making them infight with crabs. Exosoldiers have both strong ranged attacks (Single-target and AOE) and survivability, making them an absolute pain to deal with in large group. Using an EMP grenade isn't always viable, because the bot will nullify it like it's casting Counter-Nade', meaning you'll almost always have to waste AP on it first before you can throw an EMP grenade. There seems to be very little weakness for the enemies in this DLC.
-Bland, boring gameplay loop. Like some have pointed out, it's like Deep Cavern, but somehow worse.

TL;DR: Shockingly bad when compared to the main game and The Expedition DLC. 4/10",1,0

"Generic survival game with all the necessary mechanics. However, the world is small and there’s nothing new. 

The first impression is not very good. The game suggests that you start with showcase demo mode that is apparently a tutorial. I couldn't test it because it doesn't work. When you click the button, you get stuck with nothing but a black and white environment. The game is broken since none of the buttons work, and the only way out is to force close it.

On the other hand, a tutorial is unlikely to teach you anything new. Fortunately, everything works nicely when you start playing the main game. The genre is a survival game with every mechanic found in similar titles. You must ensure that you have adequate water and food, gather resources, create new items, and just try to survive.

In comparison to other survival games, this is actually fairly simple. Of course, you will die a lot due to a variety of threats like as zombies, environmental hazards, and hunger, which occurs far too quickly for my liking. Water is especially difficult because you need to drink every few minutes.

Death isn't especially painful, however you lose everything in your pockets. Depending on your medical situation and food, it may be preferable to kill yourself and respawn in excellent shape and with a full stomach. 

Everything you do earns you experience points. When you fill up the bar and earn a skill point, you can put it towards one of the three skill trees. Because you don't lose progress after death, you can grind this as well. 

The fact the game can be considered easy is because resources are everywhere. They also respawn when you go away for a few meters and then return. You can simply ""grind"" a spot until you're satisfied. Furthermore, resources are distributed at random, so you may receive something different each time.

Optimization is not very good. Despite decent and consistent low-poly visuals throughout the game, there are simply too many resources squandered for overall ""simple"" aesthetics. I felt my computer was struggling with each step I took.",0,1

"This one requires a keyboard and cannot be played with a mouse only. A generally positive experience marred occasionally by janky platforming and inconsistent liquid physics. I found, when drilling for the liquid to spill more reliably, it is sometimes better not to stand flush to the wall, but to take a step back and then set the drill off.

It took just under two and a half hours to play through.",0,1
"Hmm based on what I have played so far. Yes, my PC meets system requirements.

1. 3 bar connection is way worse than that of Tekken 7, most of the match feel like your opponent is teleporting across the screen. Probably due to how rollback is implemented. Wifi or wired, same problem as I have tested with both. My connection has good ratings based on tests I have done for pings,latency,jitter etc. If your region has less players this might be a problem.

2. Match making takes too long and ping is worse compared to what I get in T7 with people(might just be my isp though, could be different for other people). So searching algorithm should definitely be changed. Rather than checking if connection matches, then match make or not, would it not be faster to just match make if connection requirements are met? In comparison T7 matchmaking is a lot faster.

3. Cross platform is even more laggy.

4. Besides connection, they should also have an indicator which shows us whether hardware of opponent is good enough or not. Weak hardware can also cause lag for online matches. Ability to filter by those specs would also be useful I believe. What good would be a nice connection if someone doesn't have pc strong enough to handle the game?

5. Now coming to louge, it would be better to match us with everyone connected to arcade machine rather than people just sitting besides the near machine. That way we can have variety of opponents. When the group of machines only have like 2 arcades, you would end up facing same guy again and again kinda like what happens in T7,despite rejecting the match.

6. Ghost battle needs a bit of improvement. It doesn't adapt much to what we do compared to real players. On a positive note, these aren't laggy.

7. Ranking system is better than T7. If there is no demotion up to Yellow ranks, newbies may have more people of their level to fight on.  But I hope it isn't saved locally else people can still smurf. Only change I would suggest is, demoted characters also get auto promoted. If someone is bad with a character,it is fair for them to fall down to bottom rather than having someone intentionally demote a character so that they can start that character at 1st dan. 

So that's all I have to say about it, take it as you will.",1,0

"It's alright. I'd say I approximately got what I paid for. There are a few things to think about, but most of the game is just repeating what you already know. 

I feel the game could be made a bit better by giving resources more freely and having the player build 2-3 tiles per turn on average instead of nearly just one every turn as the cycling through crops part is not that exciting. The meat of the game is learning to design intelligent layouts, so the main loop should focus on having the player do that a little more.

I also think the secret tiles unlock progression doesn't fit well into the game as it currently is.

"[b]This ""prologue"" feels like a demo of a beta release[/b]

[h3]Pros[/h3] 
[olist]
[*]The story so far seems interesting, nothing too groundbreaking and a bit too similar to Half-Life
[*]Visually, the game looks quite good and runs well, I never dipped below 150 fps (for my pc this is unusual)
[*]The puzzles are simple to understand but satisfying to figure out
[*]I personally really like the energy manipulator as a puzzle solving device
[/olist]

[h3]Cons[/h3] 
[olist]
[*]Unlike what the description on steam says ""a pair of gameplay hours"", this prologue takes less than 1 hour to complete even if you stop to read everything
[*]The Valve inspirations are too on the nose, everything from the story all the way to game mechanics and even the loading screen can be compared to Half-Life or Portal, which in my opinion, deprives this game from its own identity
[*][b]The voice-acting and the script is absolutely horrendous[/b] which is a shame because theres a lot of it (this is my biggest complaint about this game)
[*]The game stops you a few times to listen to dialogue and dump exposition which completely kills the flow and reminds you of how terrible the VA is
[*]The trailer in this steam page spoils almost all of the puzzles in the prologue (seriosuly, dont watch the trailer)
[*]The movement speed is frustratingly slow, crouching makes you extremely slow and sometimes you're forced to crouch to fit into vents
[*]Walking around industrial looking buildings gets boring very quickly, in a game about travelling between dimensions this feels like a huge waste
[*]I encountered a lot of bugs, although none of them were game-breaking, they were almost always annoying [spoiler]like using the green energy to stop the door from slamming but no matter how high I stopped it, I couldnt pass without wiggling myself and jumping while crouched[/spoiler]
[*]Stacking objects to climb somewhere is very frustrating because objects are very easy to be knocked away and jumping is very clunky

I forgot this was a prologue while playing and fully expected to have a prompt at the end of the game telling me this was a beta release and to submit bugs and feedback, which is what made me write this review.

"After 75 minutes of ""playtime"" I have come to some conclusions. I will state them in the order least of an issue to most of an issue in my opinion. The North America server had a single English speaker (excluding myself) though a lot of Chinese (I believe it's Chinese) speakers. The server list provides no information whatsoever, all there is is the server name, a - symbol under game started and -1 ping for all of them. The performance is quite irritating, as it runs like a potato randomly, then randomly its fine constantly. The game was incredibly difficult to launch, I had to force close it 3 times just to get to the main menu and then it crashed twice while I was changing settings as well as having to be force closed after it stopped responding while loading me into a game. Most of my time spent on the game was trying to get it to work, I got to spectate a bunch of players speaking like auctioneers that I couldn't understand and I didn't get to play even once. Does the game look fun? Yes. Do I trust that the game is fun? Yes. Do I want to play the game? Yes. That concludes my piece until I can actually play the game.

"[h1]Experienced on the Meta Quest 2[/h1]

You can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/ap1kWKqsAdk

Siienaa is a mostly cinematic experience with almost no interactions. In most scenes, you could just confuse it for a VR rollercoaster ride, except you're just floating in the air, going from point A to point B. All you have to do is sit back, relax, and enjoy the visuals. There are two scenes where you can teleport around. In those scenes, you just explore the area until you find an orb to take you to another location.

There are 6 different mini-experiences. It took me approximately 30 minutes to enjoy all the content. There's only the desert environment with a few variations, along with some character models. The animations are very basic or nonexistent. The sounds are generic & poor, you hear them coming from a certain area but there is nothing there and they just don't fit the creatures around. 

The desert environment is nice & there are some variations that change up the experience, but it's not as varied as it should be given this price-range. The character models also seem to be original, but again, there's not enough variety. The poor animations also make them not as interesting to look at as they should be.

Experience is running on the Unreal Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting a steady 90 frames per second. I did not experience any serious issues or bugs. I believe there's only two scenes where you have teleportation available, but no smooth or snap turning. The rest of the scenes are on-rails where you're just floating in the air for who knows what reason. It would have been nicer to mount one of the flying creatures. There are no meaningful VR interactions, other than touching the orb to select the different scenes.

At the end of the day, this experience is over-priced for what it is. It's obvious this developer has some talent. This is a nice looking, sci-fi, surreal desert environments and the creatures look interesting. However, the poor animations, poor sounds, & poor VR interactions & lack of variety do bring the experience down. Some may enjoy this experience more than me, but I was pretty bored.

However, this is a recently released game, so there might not be many stuff to play around, and I don't know if my opinion is valid. I've reached the 3rd set of mazes took quite sometime yet I got back to the starting room and go check the portals and there is no checkpoint to be found. It's a roguelike game but does it really need to be this hardcore? To be honest I feels so tired after defeated 2 bosses, save the game, and return to the starting room just to find that if I want to go to that point again I have to start over.

Again, I recommend this game if you love story driven game or you're jobless and have nothing to do.

Edit: I best the game and I gotta say it's very disappointing. There is no reward for beating the game except a cheat skill and the extra same old labylinth with harder difficulty, everything else is repetitive. I changed my mind, I can't recommend this for anyone at least not now. The game look likes unfinished as there is almost daily update and there are so many questionable interesting spots that is currently cannot be interacted in any way. The NSFW content is brilliant but the main content ruined it. As for the end game content, with the right combination of emblems and skill you'll become a cheat character, almost unstoppable save for your own error.",1,0

"2023 Review Update: The game appears to be abondonware, last time the game was ever updated was March 19th, 2022. The dev said they were going to add a feature to enable us to build together our own planes, but that never seemed to have arrived. Planes are available, but they cannot be flown by players.

This game was $23 Canadian when I initially bought this, I bought this to support small gamedevs. But this project is abandoned?

I like where this game is going so far from the amount of time I had been doing practice sessions, looking forward to seeing how the development for building aircraft loadouts will result as.

"Death Roads: Tournament Prologue - Steam Review #96 By HyPo Hawking
Rating : 4/10
I know this is like a trial for the full game but they should have made a demo instead, in my eyes a prologue is a prequel to a game or extra content with a beginning and an end. When i died on the boss and i saw it wanted me to buy the full game i realized this is not what i perceive as a prologue. I had fun with the game, i liked using cards and i liked how the more i played the more tactical i had to get, which i found a lot of fun. I mean this game and its concept have a lot of potential and i of course wishlisted the full game since when it comes out of early access one day i hope to play it until the end. From what i played this is a fun roquelike with cards and a nice twist to car combat. My rating is mostly based that this prologue is not either a prequel or something new to get the player hooked on the game, like content exclusive to the prologue the full game wont have, i might be wrong but i think the game and its concept are good, like a 5/10 or 6/10 and the potential for the full game is like a 6.5/10 to an 8/10. All depends how the game ends up being done in the long run. From what i played in the prologue i had fun, but i have to treat it as i perceive a prologue to be and what i expect out of a prologue,this game would normally be like a 6/10 but for the sake of giving my honest thoughts and following my review codex , it gets a 4/10 because the prologue was done like a demo and not an actual way i described in the review on how i want and expect a prologue to be. My playtime might have been short but it was enough to make me be like, i want to check this out one day when a full release hits. Wishing all the best to the developers of this game and i hope they deliver a fun game on a full 1.0 release.",1,0

"This game needs a LOT of work, as im sure the devoloper is already aware. Ill cut them some slack though, its a one man operation at the moment but honestly I can see where this is going. It reminds me of the old school ghost recon games.

The graphics dont bother me so much, even if the weapon and player models need work I dont mind them being low poly like a game from 2001 if it means it can run smooth on any PC, and as long as the AI and core game mechanics get the TLC they need. The length of the game at this point in time isnt as important as making sure the quality of life for the missions that are here are increased.

As of now you only get one set of equipment for spawning in any mission. The AI *WILL* see you through the fog and jungle and the draw distance and dome you whenever they feel like it, before you have any chance to see them. Granted this makes it somewhat authentic to real life considering a lot of people snuff it and never see the guy who shoots them on patrol, but usually that doesnt happen because of Game Engine logic that allows the AI to see you through objects. So far this is the biggest problem. It makes most of the missions borderline unplayable. 

TLDR Ill come back to this game in a few months I guess and see if I made the right choice supporting a game in Embryonic Access, but from waht ive seen so far the dev has the vision for a game like this, they just need to put in the time bug squashing and maybe see if they can hire some more people to help them bring that vision to life.",0,1

"You might find something to like here if you were part of the ""in crowd"" of iiRcade. It looks like they used most of the Youtube personalities in the community as characters. Also made a character for independent wrestler ""Warhorse"". I'm unsure how he ties in to the game but he's here. The music is good from what I've heard so far. The commentator is kind of funny the first couple of times he says repetitive lines. That setting to turn it off the developer mentions will be appreciated. 

That's kind of where the positives end. Now for the negatives...
-You take damage far too quickly. 
-You lose lives on obstacles before you've had a chance to recognize how they work.
-Game incorporates a lane shifting gimmick where you can move from foreground to background similar to the old Fatal Fury games but not done as well. It is hard to describe why but it doesn't feel intuitive.

"It's really easy to think of it as just another one Portal inspired puzzle game, at least that's what i initially thought.
But so far it seems to be focusing less on the puzzles and more on a story, comparing to other similar games. 

The puzzles present are quite basic, since almost each one serves as introduction to a new mechanic.
In most of them the game directly states the solution one way or another 
(my favorite is the one introducing heat)

As for the story, again, it's easy to start comparing it to Portal or Half-Life, as the inspiration is really apparent.
Larger similarities are easy to notice, i will only point out the loading screen, which is similar to Portal, and the names: 
the only female character is named Alex and although the MC is named Henry, there's another character named Gordon.

If anything, it also has similarities to other games, like terminals with workmails similar to Deus Ex or rather Prey 2017.
The concept of ""two scientists did something disastrous"", where one is ""bad"" and other is ""less bad"", reminded me of Singularity.
And the ""Sticks"" are similar to The Dark Ones from Metro series.

All of it are just observations, not to make fun of but to point out possible inspirations.
What matters is the fact that so far the game manages to tie things together decently enough for it to feel like it's all connected and has a purpose for the narrative rather than being just a bunch of concepts in vacuum.
I found myself really invested and have read all the notes and emails, there are not that much, but i'm certain that many people won't care for them, thinking that out loud spoken information should be enough, which is honestly a fair point too.

The only form of critique i can provide so far is that the ending sequence felt quite anticlimactic and abrupt.
It clearly wants to be a chase scene, but there's no real tension.
And i was slightly expecting the eventual appearence of the Sticks to feel more ominous like with The Dark Ones, or at least more scary, closer to something like Alien Isolation\Prey 2017, but it's just me busting my expectations.

Other than that, things worth noting are ""parkour"" and movespeed\absence of running.
The first just feels a bit janky and the second i honestly find okay as is, given that so far corridor segments are either too small or have something going on for it to actually matter.

Anyways, I'm certainly will be waiting for more, as i got pretty captivated by the plot.

Shattered Land Tips: 
- If you want to speed up the gameplay turn off animations (hotkey: ""A"")
- You can pre-buff area affect spells by having your full party visible (hotkey: ""5"")
- Thieves deal sneak attack damage when behind a creature (creature must be facing opposite direction)
- The game may try to force you to end your turn through a toggle (using all movement, being 'stuck' from a spell/effect), close the toggle and you can continue fighting (shoot, spell, attack adjacent enemies).
- You'll gain a lot of XP playing through the game so creating characters with at least 2 classes is definitely worth it (I beat the game with 3 characters with 3 classes, and one with 2 classes and they were all near max level by the end, so would definitely be max at 2 classes each)
- You can max your stats/hp by clicking the box next to the number during character creation (max constitution before maxing HP)
- There is a 'default' party by loading the game and pressing start game without creating any characters
- Money is nearly useless so don't worry about looting everything
- Haste is the best spell
- Dual wielding weapons gives no determinable penalty and you can attack more
- Some higher-end enemies can destroy your armour / weapons permanently, so keep an eye out for the text (it flashes quickly).
- Clerics are unique in Dark Sun; each elemental sphere of cleric has its own unique (and small selection) of spells. Clerics never learn healing spells or resurrections other than Cure Minor Wounds, while Druids get Cure Serious Wounds, and Cure Critical Wounds, as well as the Raise Dead spell. Clerics are seriously under powered/low-utility.

Wake of the Ravager Tips (adding as I play through):
- Left shift key skips the opening videos
- The default Half-Giant gladiator character (Gerakis) starts with a special weapon, so start with him and transfer the weapon over and drop/add a new character in his place if you want the weapon but not the character. (may also appear in inventory of new parties?)

"[b] *Received for free as I was an Early Access player* [/b]

[b] TL;DR: [/b]If you're low on money, you don't miss out on anything by not buying it.

The items are nice, but most are reskins of other very common in-game items and you'll be replacing them anyway a few hours in. They are only relevant for those who have played Larian's previous game, [i] Divinity: Original Sin 2[/i], as they are references from that game. The only actually useful item is the [i]Mask of the Shapeshifter[/i], which gives you free uses of the [i]Disguise Self[/i] spell (and the spell itself is not one you'd use that often).

The [i] ""Aventurer's Pouch"" [/i]can be sort of useful, especially if it's your first time playing, but, similarly to the D:OS2 items, you're probably going to be finding enough and better resources a few hours in (I didn't even use it). 

The dice reskin is just that, a dice reskin (and at first can be sort of confusing since they replace the '20' with the Larian Studios logo and the '1' with a Mind Flayer face). The paintings are more of ""unofficial collectibles"" since you find them hidden throughout the game, but can't really do anything with them until you've reached the city and rented out a room at the Elfsong Tavern (mid Act III).

The artbook is nice and shows a lot of interesting stuff; having the soundtrack in the other hand is great for easy access, but the average person can just find them on Youtube or Spotify anyway (the composer has his own channel / account).",0,1

"[h1] A Card Game KING review [/h1]
Castaway Stations has a lot of promising aspects (like controlling two heroes and teamwork cards) but also has its fair share of shortcomings. If you look past the issues, it is a fun card game with some interesting mechanics, but more experienced card players might find some of its aspects frustrating.

To name a few, when you die, you restart from the beginning. This is standard roguelike stuff, except the events and battles are not always randomized, so it feels like a slog to go through them with a very similar deck. 
The other issue is enemy variety. 90% of the time you will fight the same looking enemy that frankly also plays very similarly. They often feel like damage sponges to stat-check your deck rather than offering interesting mechanics to interact with.
Another issue is that it takes a while to unlock a character so the first part of the game can feel very grueling to repeat. There is a lot of linearity in a game that is also a roguelike and the combination of the two makes it quite repetitive.

One interesting aspect I would like to mention, is that cards have limited uses. Iris and the Giant does this and when done well, it forces the player to keep building their deck and never having a ""final deck"" which can be fun. Unfortunately, replacement cards feel very slow to acquire and re-charging them means spending resources that could be spent on upgrading equipment. Often I would find myself skipping an entire turn or turns and dragging out the battle, so I can finish off my enemy with a weaker card and not lose charges on my strong card.

Last of the negatives is that animations can feel slow dragging out the game even longer. Particularly some attack's animations don't feel impactful on top of them being slower to resolve.

While the game has a fair bit of challenges to overcome, it does offer some interesting mechanics to play with. Equipment, for example, adds cards to your deck but those cards are entirely different depending on which character equips the weapon which adds some variety. 
I mentioned before a mechanic I liked: controlling two heroes and teamwork cards which can be played outside of the card owners turn to help their teammate, setting up some powerful turns in the process. 
One cool concept is there exists a shared deck which contains special environment cards which makes battles a bit more diversified depending on where you battle.

Although rare, there is a card creation gimmick which is an interesting idea and wished it was a bit more prevalent. 

The card play in general is satisfying. While there aren't many big and complex combos you can do, you can still derive pleasure from making a deck that works and playing cards efficiently while setting up big turns.


[h1][b]The positive[/b] [/h1] 
+ Solid card play.

+ Good visuals.

+ Equipment cards adding special cards depending on the character is a cool concept.

+ Environment deck that adds playable cards depending on the current environment is a fun idea


[h1][b]The neutral[/b][/h1] 
* Slow animations slow down the pace of the game.

* Cards having limited uses has promise but the current iteration makes it more frustrating than rewarding.

* You can name enemies for fun.


[h1][b]The negative[/b][/h1] 
- Poor enemy variety.

- Feels repetitive due to several factors, but one is having the same encounters with low enemy variety and the generally slow pacing.


[h1][b]Conclusion:[/b] [/h1] 
Overall, it's a game that has promise and would need a few updates to make it really stand out. For now it's a solid addition for those who are eager to look past the game's shortcomings. Careful recommendation.

"SALE ONLY

Very bad selection of tracks and twice the release asking price in comparison to the Intercontinental GT Pack which we got 4 legendary tracks which were incredible to race on.

[h1]Watkins Glen is the only redeeming feature of this [/h1]. Not a coincidence of being an Old School circuit. Sadly only 1 layout is included which is the long international with the inner loop.

So, the pro:

Watkins Glen look like it was made by gods in 3D scan and modeling. The textures are phenomenal. Loads of details and imperfections are brought into the model. It is an old circuit and well used so it shows. It beautifully shows and the Glen is immortalized in this form on ACC for ever. So good. My only bet on this pack was this and it was worth it.

Now, the cons:

COTA is soul less.

Indianapolis, >>>the road course that is<<<, is bland, flat and the flow doesn't come naturally. Awful track to race, always have been since the 2000s. This version, features the butchered Turn 1 that is so sharp and so into Turn 2, feels like you'll face the opposite direction before seeing the apex of T2. So many turns don't flow well and no oval feature involved to redeem a flat layout for being inside an oval. Feels such a waste of tech to scan and make the track. Not a single oval turn is in the layout.

The original F1 GP layout from the 2000s at least had the oval Turn 1 as its last turn, but for safety (I presume) the oval T1 was omitted in exchange for a small complex of turns into the inside field and it comes back at the oval on the main straight. It has been like this for some time but it brings nowhere near the glow of that final F1 GP corner. It is the layout problem, not Kunos. 

The modeling was done impeccably. The textures. The tower. Beautiful.

Am I racing in all of 3 tracks looking forward? Yeah I will. Racing is racing, regardless the layout.

Will COTA and Indy put a grin on my face like Bathrust, Suzuka, Kyalami, Imola and Laguna Seca? Maybe, but for sure not as wide of a grin as I got racing on those other 5 DLC tracks.

Still waiting for that Daytona road course.

Happy for Watkins making it, but no way I'm recommending this above other DLCs, so this is leaning into a not recommended.

Get better at track selection, and people will purchase your pack, Kunos. Instead of having to put 60% off after a couple of months of release.",0,1

The addition of the Re-action mechanic is a Godsend. It makes it easier to grind maps, build item levels, solo level characters, and spread the chains of portals far and wide. Also, extra turns for each character on the path? Don't mind if I do!

Now I feel like I can take my time on maps and plan out how I'm going to handle portals. I feel compelled to get full clears on almost every map.

Grinding for me was really slow at first, mainly because I really wanted to kill the level 40 monster in chapter 4. By that point, you're usually around level 15ish. I played through the dark world for a bit, but progress was slow. I decided I was going to do the only thing that made sense: I was going to kill my party members to grind each character up to around level 25. It worked, and didn't take a long time. By the time Prier was level 30, we took down the big monster. 

I was told that killing your teammates gets you the bad ending, but the guidebook that I bought almost 20 years ago says nothing about it. Please correct me in the comments if this is the case.

Overall, this version feels like the definitive La Pucelle experience for me. I was also super happy that I could recruit my favourite Marl universe character -at the beginning of the game, no less!

This has totally been worth the wait for me. I've been itching since the Steam page dropped earlier this year.

UPDATE: I just finished my file. Everything carries over to new game plus. The Overlord story is fun, and being able to carry over everything from that to a new game+ to play the original story again... IT'S SO GOOD!",0,1
"I was a bit disappointed in the beginning because i thought it was a actual game.  There was a ton of reading 4 hours worth, Narrator setting didn't work for me unless it doesn't read the story for you in a ""Narrator"" voice.  With that it did get me hooked because I did read the story from start to finish.  Having ADHD that's hard to do unless something does capture my attention and is interesting.   You get to choose powers and I feel i may play it again to chose Dream walking and Possession to see how the story plays out since you get to make choices and determine what kind of ghost you are in a way.  Not sure how many ending there are. Which makes me what to go after the others as well.  All and all if you like reading this isn't a bad choice of a game and pretty decent story its only a couple dollars, why not help an independent creator out and put it in your library.",0,1

"Good: ""100 World Story"" reboot in 2023, modding support (see Steam guides for documentation), solid controller support that adjusts icons based on the detected controller, decent amount of options to configure rules such as disabling PvP events.

Bad: ""100 World Story"", even on the Famicom (NES), had AI support - and it was decent for its time! This game doesn't, and as a hobbyist coder/modder myself I can't imagine it would have taken a lot of development time to support AI players. It doesn't feel like the formula has evolved significantly - while I would otherwise call this the better game, lack of AI makes for a weaker experience if you don't have 3-4 players already.

I've yet to peer over the modding capabilities in detail, but that's what will carry this game longterm, if it succeeds. As it stands, hard to recommend if you don't have a regular local or Discord/Steam Remote Play group, but if AI ever became a thing, that would change. Recommended, but only for those with casual groups to play with in its current form.",0,1

"[h2]100 Days without delays[/h2]

[h1]PC Candy Crush?!!??[/h1]

Whenever I see a match-three game, I automatically think about Candy Crush since that’s probably the most popular title in this genre. If you have been using Steam for a decent amount of time, I am pretty sure you’d have come across a shit load of such games since indie game makers love to milk games from genres like this since they’re easy to make and many players like playing these titles to kill time. I’d say that this game also falls under the same category. But yeah, it is actually fun when you’re bored asf. 

[h1]About This Game [/h1]

[h2]Storyline [/h2]

The game has a mini plotline to accompany the gameplay. It isn’t something very unique or spectacular so don’t have high hopes, okay? It goes something like this:
[code]You play as Lee Milton who almost gets fired from her job but manages to convince her boss to allow her to open and manage a new airport. The boss gives her a period of 100 days to accomplish this or he would have to let her go. It’s your job to accompany her on this journey of building an airport from scratch. Collect stars, upgrade the airport, and solve crimes. Are you up for this task?[/code]

There’s actually more to the story but it’s best if you play to experience it. If you ask me, the situations you “encounter” are a bit too cliche. In layman’s terms, the story is dry and boring. 

[h2]Gameplay Mechanics [/h2]

I didn’t mention this in the introduction since I wanted to talk about it in this segment. So, this game is just a lazy port of a mobile game that is free to play on the Playstore and the Appstore. This factor immediately makes this game not worth even a cent. So yeah, I obviously will not recommend buying this game in the end. 

I am pretty confident that almost everyone knows how Match-Three games work right? This game has the base match-three mechanics. The major different thing this game has is how progression works. So, if I am right, this game comprises a total of 100 levels. After completing each level, you get a star which means you get a total of 100 stars. These stars can be used to upgrade the airport. You can only unlock the next upgrade after buying the current one. After purchasing certain upgrades, you get a glimpse of the next part of the storyline. So yes, as I said, a different way of progression. 

Now, about the actual gameplay. As I said before, gameplay-wise, it’s like any other game in the genre. 	Matching more than 3 of the same icons will give you a power-up icon. Till where I played, I had access to four of these power-ups. One of them is like a boomerang that will go and hit a tile of interest, one of them gets rid of 4 tiles around it, one clears out quite a large area and the last one is an airplane that clears out the entire row/column. I am not sure if there will be more as you play more. I stopped because the game kinda felt repetitive and became dry. It’s probably because I am not used to playing such games for a long time. 

When you replay a level, the objectives stay the same but the target tile (I call the stuff you are supposed to match as tiles, I honestly have no clue what they’re called) keeps on changing. This makes this game seem like it’s randomized but it actually isn’t entirely random since the change in the tiles has no effect whatsoever. But the placements do get changed which is random enough ig. 

Apart from the power-up tiles, you have access to three more power-up bars which can be used upon filling. In order to fill them up, you need to match the respective tiles. Till where I played, I had the single-stamp which removes one tile, the multi-stamp which removes all the same tiles and an airplane which clears out one row or column (These aren’t the real names, I made them up cuz I don’t think the devs named them). The only issue I have here is that the Airplane power-up is a bit broken since I don’t get to choose whether I want to clear a row or column. It mostly clears rows and sometimes columns. I guess it’s randomized but it’s very unconventional when you don’t get to make this choice. 

The best thing about this game is that you can either choose to have a challenge when playing or not. In the setting menu, you can choose whether you want to activate or deactivate the level timer and move limit. I played it with both of them deactivated for the relaxing experience I wanted to extract from this game. 

[h2]Visuals & Audio[/h2]

The visual aspect of this game is very minimalistic. Like, there isn’t anything really unique about it. There are only a few character models that look creepy (to me at least). What I didn’t comprehend is why they used leaves, clouds, drops, flowers, etc for the gameplay which has no connection to the game’s main theme which happens to be an Airport. But overall, the game gives off the pleasant indie game vibes with a calming color palette used on each and every element. 

The game’s soundtrack is very very annoying. I played the game muted the whole time. It’s better to listen to Spotify while playing this game. The other in-game sound effects are decent. But yeah, it’d be cool if they had better background music and a bigger collection of soundtracks. 

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
[*] Basic Match-Three games with a few unique elements.
[*] A pretty good way to kill time.
[*] You can disable challenging elements (The timer and moves limit) to have a relaxing playing session. 
[*] The visuals are okay.
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
[*] Feels very repetitive.
[*] The game is F2P on mobile devices. 
[*] Plot is eh. 
[*] There are a few bugs. Like I once had a bug where I couldn’t finish the level since the last item I needed to collect never spawned so I was forced to restart the level.
[*] Horrible Soundtrack.
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

I don’t play games like this a lot. So, this can be considered a unique experience for me. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game due to the abovementioned factors. If you do have a few bucks to spare, then go ahead and buy this game, I won’t stop you. But it’s not really worth it when you can just download it and play it on your phone. It has a similar name on the Playstore & Appstore.

"They gave me an Epic Games code instead of a Steam Code.

XQ87W-HUWPW-DE3BF-P5F2G",1,0
"It's incomplete. I can't describe it any other way. It has some growing pains it will likely go through in the near future. I think the first thing to address is my headset because it causes the most incompatibility with games I've seen so assume anything that relies on it (height, tracking, controllers, etc.) could just randomly have problems. That aside, some games work well on it, so I know it's possible.

(I think) headset related bugs:
-Sprinting it difficult to activate unless you're looking at your hands, likely due to camera positions + how it reads the up and down movement, I would've preferred a more accelerometer based approach but this might have been more reliable idk.
-The 'abxy' buttons are not mapped by default so dash and jump need to be mapped. I published my config, all it is is abxy mapped.
-Reaching over your shoulder or for your side weapons in difficult, they don't line up on my body.
-My arms/shoulders are like a second set of arms beneath my arms that meet at my hands, this wouldn't be an issue if they couldn't collide, but collision is important for realism so idk.
-Response to controller movement is average, which would be better if it didn't rely so heavily on it working.
-My height felt all wrong, I left it on auto but even when I set it manually, things felt off.
With WMR/Reverb G2 issues out of the way:
-The weapon rack had the executioner's sword off center, and it's trigger would prevent you from grabbing swords next to it even if your hand was essentially touching the other sword because it's trigger area is so large. 
-The ice magic staff I assume is meant to represented by the top diagram on the stone pillar but it's diagram is clockwise, just like the fire, when it's actually counter-clockwise for the spell.
-Dialogue is all but inaudible when not staring basically right at the character.
-Triggering the bell at the blacksmith is challenging.
-The tutorial has a boss, this boss is fun but nothing about the consequences of dying were explained (matter, weapons on the ground, potion loss, etc.)
-The way you are intended to move the panels when ordering at the blacksmith is unclear: can you grab it, or only slide it, why is it so hard to trigger? 

Now I've griped, let's talk about what they did right, which is what I'm very happy with and why despite what I mentioned above, I played for 2 and half hours without taking off the headset.
1) SteamVR. It works great, and binding adjument on the fly worked a charm. What buttons 1 and 2 were wasn't clear but everything worked so it's fine.
2) Game feel. I felt immersed, wanting to swing my sword with accurate and powerful blows (though the speed might not affect damage, idk). This is a game I can see myself playing again and becoming invested in the story and progression of.
2a) Magic. Very fun, balanced by limits on knockback, shields, and mana pool. At first I thought it would make it too easy but mana regen speed means that when your pool is empty, you feel more at ease if you pull out a sword or hammer to fight with while your mana regens. I've got the ice and fire staves and they have similar function-ish with great recognition of what is and isn't the right shape, only wish it worked vertically. Can't have your cake and eat it too, i guess.
2b) Weapons. With immersive combat comes a need for fun and varied weapons, and what better way to serve that than by giving that? You have axes, swords, hammers, daggers, spears, shields, and magic staves all of which have multiple variants to craft. Choose handle, blade shape, guard, etc. 
2c) Potions and materials. You lose all but your starting potions when you die (provided they are unused) but materials aren't kept with you. Both materials and potions are 'hidden' throughout the places you might engage in combat. Materials are for weapons, they are schematics (for the previously mentions weapon building) and resources like wood, iron, and gems. Potions are used to recover health and/or mana should you choose to use them. They can be found the same way as materials: as occasional drops or as loot/hidden treasure.
3) Skill tree and armor. I like that your armor is free and interchangeable depending on your build, just like resetting your perks is so you're very free to explore different playstyles. Health regen to compensate for choosing heavy armor? nice. things like that.
4) Switching it up. There isn't a time I've encountered (except when I died, all enemies respawn if you die, loot doesn't, go collect your corpse) that made me feel bored. I never thought about quitting because there was nothing different. The story doesn't force too much on you and it plays easily, keeping your interest the while time.
5) Menus. Pause is a thing (not): you can press your settings button and the game keeps going and you're still able to move. Accepting quests and interacting with the guide felt very natural. I especially liked the nod to accept.

Overall, I'd say they've got work to do, and not just for WMR. Bugs are common in a early access game and I really look forward to what this looks like in a few months when it's more mature. Overall, I recommend this game with the understanding that what you;re getting is still being worked on and it not done yet. Also. the herbalist looks weird (so does the old man, but that's just old people). To devs reading this, good luck, I can see you really care about making this a great game.",0,1

"The Great Below is a videogame yes, but is also a desolate art museum, a philosophical exploration on loneliness and the pursuit of knowledge and meaning, a study on human fragility, a post-horror experience and probably a lot more things that I haven´t realized just yet but the game keeps just appearing in my thoughts long after I finished it, making me wonder if I truly understood all the messages it tried to convey.

It is also cruel, perverse & claustrophobic, from the obtuse controls, the narrow spaces, the restricted camera views and the obscure lore, I learned to appreciate how all these things work together like cogs in a dark, ruthless industrial machine that is tuned to perfection to forcefully convey the message that the studio wanted to convey.

A bold, unique and necessary experience in today´s world of cliched horror experiences. Give it a try and immerse yourself in it and it will not disappoint.",0,1

"It's interesting. I liked the company's previous game (Hashihime) better, mostly because it made more sense.

The story is broken down in 3 chapters, following the same story from a different character's point of view. Each chapter follows one couple. You only get access to the first chapter to begin with. 
The first chapter starts veeery slow. Towards the end if it it feels very rushed and it makes no sense. All of a sudden there's a dog that never appeared before that changes into a pillar and they all go through his eye and that's super random. And all that follows. I was actually so put off that I stopped playing the game. I picked it back up now after several months.
The second and third chapters fill in the information you were missing. The second one was ok, it actually clears a lot of things up. The third one clears things up and explains the dog, but there's also quite a lot of confusing things in it still.
The breaking down this way making the story make no sense at the end does the game a disservice. They should've at least made sure you have met all the characters by the end.

Characters are ok. They are quite flawed and there's a lot to dislike about them, but I suppose that was the point of the story. The dog was my favourite character, too bad he only appears properly in chapter 3. He's in chapter 1 too but makes no sense there, since you don't know anything about him. I usually hate ""comic relief"" characters but this one was very well done.

Art is... weird. It's pretty, but weird. Had a hard time understanding fighting and kaiju scenes. There's not a lot of classic IF's sprites on top of backgrounds, mostly it's different CGs standalone or just the backgrounds.

I liked the music. There's moments where it disappears altogether but I liked all the pieces and found they fit surprisingly well.

And lastly, for the BL part. The romances are uniquely done. Love confessions that go right to your core. Sex scenes are there - more conventional ones, but also a bit of noncon in the second chapter and some monster / human. There's also one straight scene (not too detailed), part of one of the character's arcs (he's not straight though).

Overall, I recommend it, the themes are really unique and the whole game is worth experiencing, but be prepared for the rushed seemingly nonsensical last part of chapter 1. It will get explained later (mostly).",0,1

Unfortunately, like most music-oriented games, the game suffers from a limited catalog with an even more limited genre. Of the 30 or so songs available, I find myself only interested in 4 of them (2 being covers)...

"I recently played ""Playtown,"" and I found it to be an intriguing but somewhat incomplete experience. The game has its merits, but there are areas where it falls short.

Pros:

- Intriguing Concept: The game's premise is fascinating, and it draws you in with its unique approach.

Cons:

- Minimal Guidance: One of the game's major drawbacks is the lack of clear instructions. It can be bewildering at times, making it challenging to progress. However, this ambiguity also adds an element of mystery.

- Unfinished Feel: ""Playtown"" gives off an unfinished vibe. While it has potential, it appears to be a work in progress. I look forward to seeing more content added by the creator or improved upon in their next game.

Value for Money:

For the effort put in by the game developer in terms of mechanics and general play-ability, ""Playtown"" is worth the investment. However, when it comes to the story, it falls short. The narrative lacks depth and coherence. At times, it's unclear what you're supposed to be doing. For instance, there was a necklace we were supposed to find, and the girl's mother's story remained obscure. The ending was also perplexing, featuring an eye, a roar, and a sudden elevator ride.
Final Thoughts:

In summary, ""Playtown"" offers a short and interesting concept with likeable elements. It's well-suited for fans of mascot horror games who are willing to endure the game's rough edges. If you're new to mascot horror, however, I would not recommend starting with this title.
In conclusion, ""Playtown"" has potential, but it needs refinement, especially in terms of its story and guidance. I hope the developer continues to work on it, delivering a more complete and engaging experience in the future.",0,1

There are major issues like graphical error , Ai error , game breaking bugs , they don't have quest line script up yet , combat at best is mediocre ,and much more I would say 35% is done from artwork , map , character models, building models , itinerary story, and weapons ,material , etc. I would say if you gonna get it you'll have too be sold for medieval / survival game which it is , and buy it early like banner lord because on official release it'll be price as 50 maybe 60$",0,1

edit:
For the developer. Here's some feedback:
Firstly, the game needs some optimisation work. I don't have the greatest computer around but it should certainly be able to run the game better.

There were also a lot of issues with vehicles. I think I was only able to actually drive one (a tractor) but all the others would freak out and start bouncing around the moment I tried to enter them. There was also an instance were I was teleported a bit away after entering one.

Some other issues I had:
- The default volume is way too loud (and if I remember correctly, there wasn't a way to change the volume once you are in a match)
- The 3D audio seemed to have a really long fall off range, so vehicles that were really far away sounded as though they were right next to me",1,0

"Here I just dump every thought I had of this game while playing it ( and also the previous game)


Both this game and the previous Starcom game - I binged them both in practically one go. Quite addictive, but after the first time, why would you play it a second time?

Compared to the previous installment of this series, it took me awhile longer to complete it. Maybe this was due to it being more finished and complete or just the game being more difficult.

However I completed the betatest in 7 hours time and I feel like I don't want to play again. Beginning a new game feels like a grind to get back to the level of tech you were before. I also feel that replayability value is low - what else am I going to try different the next time? Even if the star systems are placed differently and have different events on planets - I think I'll still play like last time: same choices, same tech options, same everything.

I do welcome the addition of new type of gun: the Fixed Gun (or something like that). I do wish that it was available from the start so you could go for a whole USS Defiant run and blast raiders to smithereens with that. This would require that you could aim your ship with the mouse (similiar to how Transcendence (another space roguelike, great game try it out) does things.) 

During my playthrough I didn't unlock the missile launcher tech. This kind of bug seems to have occured to me three times now throughout all the three Starcom games. (Missile launcher requires three parts to unlock but never once have I managed to unlock it the first time I play this game).

This game feels quite like the previous installment, maybe the previous game should've been kept updated and the current result of the game would've been what eventually grew from years of updates.
Funnily enough, even the story feels a bit similiar.
(Asteroid blaster start / Space trash disposal
Different universe or galaxy ?? / Different universe with different physics
Alien species who look very similiar to Earth fauna / Alien species who look very similiar to Earth fauna)
Obviously the story got inspiration from previous game.

I lament the lack of Multiplayer feature in this game. This could've kept the game to some replayability. Or atleast a shipbuilder mode where you can test your ship out in an arena (similliar to how HighFleet offers).

The different alien factions just get blended into the background of the map, I forget about them and have to keep mental notes in my hand as to which stargate they are located at.
This could be avoided if some sort of sphere of influences of different species popped out (similiar to Star Control 2, where every alien got their own name labeled on the map)

Yeah, good and fun game, play it.

"I drive a forklift IRL and can confirm this game is nothing like it. The handling is inaccurate, and the use of the forks is totally wrong and downright dangerous. But then this is just a stoopid arcade racer, so none of that really matters.

The game engine is understandably poor for early access and the graphics were stolen from GTA IV, but the developer seems to understand that forklifts are completely wasted on what they are used for, and one of the biggest scandals in the world today is that these machines yearn to be hammered around in highly questionable ways. However, due to snowflake health and safety concerns, this just isn't possible. So in light of that, this game is a nice waste of time, and a way to express your inner desire to drive a small zippy killing machine around like a total nutter.",0,1

"So first off Id like to state I really enjoy this game for the 6 hours of game play currently that I have, But! It really really needs polish. 
For instance If you drop into the negatives of fuel the game currently inst counting the proper number to add up which makes it unplayable.
Also if you have a build going lets say peanuts and cows you have to roll 20-30 times costing you big bucks to not see anything that has to do with cows to increase your production of that item late game this is a killer since specialising can make a run.
The re rolls every three days needs to be reworked so that you can play and keep building up, There is also a problem with tech chains I have found its near impossible to get to the end of a tech tree like if I need a smelter but after it is a crusher ill only see crushers and never a smelter (This is simplistic but further on a tech tree it can kill a run since you can never roll into what the game should see as something that is listed as a chance to get like a priority roll. 

Also its not worth the 11$ honestly its easily in its current state a free game. With a lot more polish I would say 100% get it but until then save it to your wish list and wait for it to go on sale.",0,1

"I did enjoy the game but it does need work on it and itsn't worth the price until it does.
This review is a personal opinion on the whole game from characters to story with what I enjoyed and didn't. 
This is spoilers free
The story:

The build up for the story in the beginning is honestly quite good, the theme and ideas that was presented in the beginning was quite good. Everything was good until the later portion of the game were some things got a bit more confusing but understandable. The history with some few older characters within the game is good and straight forward to understand. It can be confusing at first but once you read the glossary and such, it can be a tad bit easier. This story format has been used but it is set up in a decent way.

The characters:

Almost all the characters in this game is actually well written for the most besides a few that has no relevance at any point and just pop up later on. The relationship you have with some of these characters does effect your dialogue options from being nice to mean depending on the choices you make which is pretty nice. I enjoy most of the characters within the book and have to say this section covered well.

RPG aspects

When it comes to skills in the game the only one that actually seems to matter would be the leadership from my experience. There really is no battles that has it where you fighting really matters, maybe when you go out with the king but at that point it doesn't matter. The skills aren't used at all which is sad.

Misc:

The game does go through some time skips which is okay but it does skip chapters *A* lot. 

tdlr: The game is a wasted development and it needs work done on it. The characters and story is solid but the build up to the end is extremely disappointing in a lot of ways. I would love it if they just updated the game and add in more content I would love to put this review in the positive light. But I can't because this game was supposedly worked on for years and the quality of this game is on the negative light. All I hope they do is too look at what they did and improve it. They can still do some edits. But I would not recommend this game until there is more work done on this.",1,0

"Not a bad game. Just not for me. I'd still recommend it to those who are into very time consuming puzzles but otherwise I'd probably suggest not playing it. Most of the puzzles were way too time consuming and boring for me so I had to use a guide in order to skip them as I don't have the patience to spend 20-30 minutes on a single puzzle. Mainly played through it for the story, and honestly disappointed. It's the most generic possible story imaginable and was pretty boring for me. But I still can recommend it for the puzzles for those who have the patience for it.",0,1
"Game that might be suitable even for those who don’t enjoy this type of puzzles.

To be honest, I've always found that filling an empty shape with randomly shaped pieces was the most frustrating type of puzzle for me. Most of all, because you were frequently left with a single piece that you couldn't position anywhere, forcing you to rearrange other parts or start from scratch.

Fortunately, this game makes puzzles a little less difficult. You must still fill up the shape by inserting and rotating parts, but there are features to assist you. The first is the symmetric nature of some puzzles; if a puzzle layout is symmetric, the solution is likely to be symmetric as well.

Then you have the pieces themselves. Sometimes they don’t come in perfect shape, so there will be empty spaces between them. Color may also have a part in finding a solution. For example, in one puzzle, the pieces must be arranged from lightest color to darkest.

The game contains approximately 80 puzzles, however not all of them require you to fill out the grid. Some puzzles need you to construct a maze between two points using the available pieces. The trick is to make the longest path possible. 

Although there aren’t any hints that will let you place a piece automatically, you can skip a puzzle if it’s too difficult. There are several puzzles available so you are never stuck.",0,1
"mmmm I want to say that I enjoyed the game but generally speaking I felt that almost every reveal/twist/development I've seen done better elsewhere so it kind of lacked any sort of identity to me. Ginka is cute sure but that can't hold an entire game. I liked ATRI a lot and still feel it is pretty novel with what it did but with GINKA I came away feeling just sort of mixed. The art is certainly beautiful though, thanks Yusano.

The free level and the forest level were the most interesting for me, the other two fell a bit flat.",1,0
"I do enjoy this game. I have a few problems with its core design.

1) The made a whale hunter. Sure you can play this for free but you will not be able to do most things, such as the events, in the limited time they offer them. Prices for things in this game are on the absurd side. I'll give an example... VIP status (which is like your sub) is $25 a WEEK. That's $100 a month plus they basically have a battle pass in this for the current season to get top tier extra rewards, they charge you for premium crates (upwards of $50) and you can outright but just about every in game currency in small quantity for $5-10 ... and THEN you have your typical mobile gatchas which you can pay real money to get more. Of course you can pay for them...

All of that would be 'okay-ish' with me for a FREE experience, but that leads me to my next point:

2) This isn't really a daily pop in and pop out game. There's actual substance, boobs are the reward which I really like. What I dislike and why its a deal breaker for me? I have to really keep this thing up all day and baby sit it every few hours just to maintain the basic gameplay loops it has (on the free side). A new day turns  over and I need to sink a good hour in it to get the basic stuff done. That's too much of a time-sink for this gamer and likley an unrealistic ask for casual gamers.

I wanted a fun and sexy little side thing to run on my 2nd monitor that isn't resource demanding whiile Cookie Clicker is going. Something I can kinda do when I play my MMO, do work, research, or watch movies. Can I realistically see myself hardcore playing this for even 40 mins a day? No. I simply cannot. If I had an extra budget of $5,ooo to blow on whale hunting games I do not think I would put it in this one either.

I was looking forward to this becoming 'my thing' but after 7 days of seeing how the gaming loop plays out? They need to redesign this to respect the players time if they want it to last. Also, if anyone spends $10,ooo USD on this (which I think might actually be possible) they deserve the right to be left outside with no laptops or phones for a week.

"Things it does well: allowing you to try to survive longer or end early, adding an extra layer of strategy.  Graphically better than many survivors games.  Doesn't have the common survivor clone ""addition"" of unreadable enemy bullets or player summons as far as I played (talk about a low bar for success - didn't mess up as hard as other clones lol).  Weapons feel reasonably impactful.

Things that are identical to all the other survivors games and wildly boring at this point: weapons, upgrades, evolution combining weapon + support upgrade, map, crates, magnets, flat numeric meta progression, enemy spawn patterns (oh, yet another circle of high health enemies with a slow chasing boss?  I can't yawn any harder), etc. 

Thing that made me refund:  If you don't upgrade your base in the right order, you cannot continue to upgrade, so you are locked out of ever getting content again - specifically I made the ""mistake"" of doing well and upgrading my HQ to level 3 before I had upgraded my gate (the thing that unlocks new maps/difficulties) to level 2.

"[h1]Beautiful Singing Boys recruiting…So, let the Squid Game begin, boy band edition![/h1]
Hanbyul is a young girl with a dream… She wishes to have the opportunity to be at the center of the spotlight with an audience enjoying her songs. Thing is… Life is never easy, and she will have to do everything within her power to overcome debts and also her grandma’s hospital bills, on top of that. So, in order to guarantee a good source of income covering all their needs. She decides to participate in a contest in which a boy band is looking for a new member to join their ranks, as a way of killing two birds with one stone.
The protagonist decides to crossdress as a boy to have a chance and win the cash offered in the aforementioned contest. Leading her into a living situation that could feel similar to the TV show called Big Brother… But the Korean edition.

You can choose between some options for your preferred disguise, three available for hairstyle and other three as per choosing an outfit of your liking. A little funny graphic issue I spotted before the game was patched, made me think: If you want to really disguise yourself as a boy, never forget about finding a way for your b00bs not to bounce around giving your disguise away!
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3078678629 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3078678587 
The plot most of the time is really easy to guess, with not so much of a plot twist to offer to the reader, and also the way of rushing the available routes as to try making you feel aware of them, feels, like, imposed and sometimes ridiculous, as the situation unfolding couldn’t be the worst timing ever for that to happen.
[spoiler]Her grandma is in a hard condition regarding her own health and the doctor is interested in asking for your number because he wants to take you out on a date… While what you wanted is a way to ensure that once the surgery costs are paid, the treatment for your closest relative will start and proceed as promised. And that’s only one of the examples you can encounter[/spoiler]
Her self-image can change a bit drastically sometimes… Going from having confidence in her own abilities to almost feeling like there’s no possible way she can do it. And that would be understandable, as it sometimes can happen in real life, but within minutes, changing her thinking so much is hard to empathize with.

There’s no skip button available nor a way to rewind the conversations or check the log, and given the fact there’s only one save slot available per walkthrough… You should be careful with your choices!
The background music in general, but more so the one trying to portray tension in the scenes unfolding ( the aforementioned, a bit excessive to be honest), can be cut out suddenly once the scene finishes… Which gained, more than once, one of my eyebrows rising at the abruptness.
One thing I would like to praise the game for, is the portrayal of the so-called Korean Wave or Hallyu, hard working conditions. Usually, all we see is glitter and not the pressure conditions the artists have to constantly endure… Even though within the game they touched the subject in a subtle way, it is good to see the problem being mentioned.

The romantic interests available:
[list]
[*]Cho Jin: The uptight guy who cannot keep up with his menacing attitude for long
[*]Chris: The easy-going guy who likes to cause mischief
[*]Haley: The supportive female option
[/list]
[h1]Things I would like to highlight:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Six languages available (Surprisingly, including Spanish, yeah you've read that right! But don’t expect the translations to be perfect. And that’s okay, it is more than the options we can usually choose from, in this genre)
[*]No way to hide the hud, so if you are planning to take screenshots, the text will linger there, hiding half of the art you wanted to capture as a memento.
[*]Character sprites have movement animations, and a more realistic art style!
[*] Well designed backgrounds
[*]Sometimes the menu freezes and you have to keep clicking around for it to react to your commands.
[*] The characters’ own opinions can change soon after having said something… It’s quite contradictory most of the time.
[*]Would be nice if the romance routes could be a bit slow-burn, but instead of that, the forced proximity suddenly burns in your face within five seconds after the love interests first appear. And the situations trying to give off vibes of a possible love triangle are far from being successfully intriguing.

"This game is absolutely gorgeous. It's complete and utter eye candy all the way through. I love the way everything looks in the game.

Thing is, it's... short. I mean, like, really short. I mean, like, you get a tutorial area and another area and, in terms of collectibles, that's kind of... it. The rest of the game is largely two separate platforming challenges, one easy, and one difficult.

The level design leaves a bit to be desired, forcing backtracking by design (go here, flip this switch or grab this powerup, go back with no difference in platforming or challenge). There are a lot of moments where you will find yourself just kind of mundanely walking from point A to point B, and it's the responsibility of the developer to make sure that even those moments are fun. It's a platformer, after all. But there isn't anything to fill in the blanks - you're just holding forward and watching your character move. There isn't a faster means of movement and navigating terrain is almost always gated into what the developer intends.

There are a handful of invisible walls deliberately placed to prevent clever usage of movement to trigger minor sequence breaks or save time. Especially later in the game, you'll find yourself butting your head against invisible walls just trying to get to platforms early and save time, and end up taking falling damage and having to take an extra-long route around because... the developer said so, pretty much. There are even death planes that specifically exist to prevent getting places without a certain powerup, so chances of a challenge run where you don't grab a powerup are pretty much nil.

The final platforming challenge is pretty fun and I enjoyed it, but it's also a pretty big context switch from the rest of the game. You'll find a lot of reviews lambasting it for being ""too hard,"" and I can understand it - it's the only instance in the game where the result of a Game Over is more punishing than bringing you back to your most recent checkpoint. For me, I found it a pretty refreshing break from the mundane walking that you're bound to be bored by at some point in the rest of the game.

Ultimately, if you want to play a short platformer for this price, I would recommend Orbo's Odyssey over this one. Pseudoregalia is also $1 cheaper. If you want to spend a little more money to guarantee a good game, though, please buy Cavern of Dreams.",1,0

  It's bad enough with the physical combat during the summer, having to do a running motion and doing that makes this game hard to play when there is high temperatures outside.

Edit: To do auto run and not break the game balance would  require allowing the auto run until you approach the enemy with an auto slow down to stop people from running past an enemy and not making the game easier. Once locked into an enemy make the person playing have to defeat them so they may not run.",0,1

"This is an okay remake, but it's budget is too low and it really shows. Didn't experience any major bugs, and it looks [i]fine[/i], but I wish it had been better. The physics are also too slow. The small delay every time you butt-bounce really frustrates me, it's pac-man's signature move and it used to be so snappy. This game also makes me really miss the flip kick from world 2 which allows you to cancel your upwards momentum, so you can land faster and thus platform faster. Really this just made me want to play world 2 because that game feels so much better and more responsive.

I like this and want to finish it. But please, if you remake world 2, don't touch the physics at all (except for the ledge climbing on platforms moving away from you which makes it impossible to climb up them), and put more time, effort, and money into fleshing out the graphics and the world.",0,1

"The ""Search All"" series is a good set of games if finding things style games are for you, if not then why are you even looking at this? Do not get me wrong I feel that in many ways they are lacking compared to some of the other games, due to the blend of background vs object art, controls, and a few other aspects. However, these things do not make them a bad games by any stretch. The addition of the HINT option on the majority of the series really saves any down sides mentioned, my biggest pet peeve in hidden object games is getting down to that last one or two objects.

As with all games of this style I feel the play time vs price, even at the low price they are, is cutting it close. A few games in the series I had to leave them running long enough to leave a review, and for those of you not in the know reviews require at least five minutes of play time.",0,1

The difficulty is progressive and it becomes stressing after some levels but there is a relaxed ( not timed) mode I didn't try.
It is in english only, making it difficult for non natives speakers ( at least for me). Fortunately, in casual mode you can get a picture of the ingredient you need to find even if you don't know what it is.

"Good but frustrating

TLDR: I would enjoy this game 200% more if it was a mobile game. 

This game is like a tamagotchi that can't leave your house, which for some people who (for instance) work from home don't need to worry about. 

I don't work from home.

This game's main gimmick is that it only runs in the background for a certain amount of time, with the maximum limit being 8 hours, after which the game will stop in its tracks and does not progress. 
You can reset this, but if it ever lapses you don't progress until you reset it. 

Again, you ONLY have 8 hours maximum before the game freezes. 

There is no worse feeling than coming home from work after a long shift to get on your computer for a couple hours only to find that absolutely nothing has progressed.

This game demands an amount of attention that I am not physically able to give it often enough for things to progress at a meaningful rate that engages me enough to care about it. 

And that really sucks because otherwise this game is great, but the pacing has FULLY lost me because of the issues I've described.

I wish the game had a longer default timer, something like 12 hours would be far more reasonable.

EDIT: Thanks giik *smooch*",0,1
"OK, this IS early access, so some problems are normal (in my original review, I mistakenly thought it was in 1.0.)  Some of the gameplay is pretty cool, but the repetitiveness is getting pretty obvious and I don't see a good way out.  I'm willing to reconsider this review later, but here are some of the issues I've got:

-What is the purpose of having to click a button to buy fuel?  Is it JUST to irritate the player?  There is no audio notification that fuel is low until your tractors just disappear--fun.  The fuel thing is also superfluous: I have never once considered whether I should buy fuel--I just buy as much as I can.  Fuel costs vary, sure, but once I start using tractors, I'm just going to buy fuel no matter what.  (You could perhaps improve this by showing the cost of fuel in the top bar instead of in the tooltip, but even then I doubt high fuel prices would ever make me think twice.)  You want to make some tractors more expensive to use, I get it, but just make this a cost per tile traversed or something.
  
-The contracts give the game a frenetic nature--especially since you're constantly slamming me with my options.  Thanks for allowing me to opt out of this, but now the choice is between forgetting that I should be taking contracts or being constantly reminded that there are some contracts available that I don't want.  You apparently want me to use cover crops, but the contract mechanic pushes me not to do this.  [Update: OK, this is more of a gameplay/style issue--just ignore contracts until you want them now.  Still, that makes contracts poorly integrated into gameplay.]

-The game is optimized REALLY poorly.  I didn't by BG3 or a top-of the line FPS.  I purchased a game that features tractors slowly moving across the screen and crops growing...slowly.  The opening menu is a slideshow.  The. Opening. Menu.  Gameplay is OK up to about 400 plots and then it's a slideshow.  Sure, I don't have a high-end computer, but I also bought a game about, you know, farming. [Update: I turned ALL graphic settings to low.  Feels bad, man.]

-Furthermore, if I fail a contract, is it taking the resources I put toward the contract?  I haven't paid close enough attention, but if this is so, then is there a reason to take contracts past early game?

-Chickens appear to eat the crops AND seeds I plant in the pens.  This is...immersive...but from a gameplay perspective, why would I want this?  The egg/honey contracts get me $500 a pop--am I supposed to get excited about this when other contracts could get me $100,000? (For those of you who think I'm exaggerating, I'm not.)  Furthermore, why is there always a honey/eggs contract past early game eating up a spot for the more lucrative contract? [Note: This last issue seems fixed] 

-Is there an endgame here?  What am I supposed to be excited about that will keep me playing?",0,1

"It's good porn', and a good breakout clone. But, neither are strong enough on their own to hold up the game if you're uninterested in the other.

The porn' is curvy, realistically anatomical girls drawn up in 32-bit style pixel art.

The game has a fast ball, with a fair amount of RNG to its bounce angles. The paddle has a generous hitbox, larger than it looks on the screen. Also, if you left-click the ball puts out a circular explosion that deletes any blocks in the vicinity. The blocks are non-obvious. They're composed of art layers, levels of clothing in the strip-tease. The game only marks out the last remaining blocks in a phase with rippling circles. So, it comes as a surprise sometimes when the ball bounces back from something you didn't know was a box with hit detection.",0,1
"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF POP CULTURE AND THE INTERNET.

Some categories include Games, Cartoons, the Internet and Disney.

All the names in Games and Disney are proper nouns, names of characters. I had to use all my daily hints on Disney alone because although I've seen most animated movies, I'm not the kinda person to memorize the name of every single character.

I barely made through the Games category because I'm a big nerd. But some of the names in it are from characters that haven't been relevant since literally the first generation of Xbox (becuase it was an Xbox exclusive at that), just to give an example.

I will recommend it because for me it was a good purchase and I'm a huge fucking nerd and I loved the Games category. But I really don't see this as a game for everyone, specially people who are either too old or too young to remember 90s cartoons or decade old games and the like.",0,1

"Let's clear the air now: I didn't buy the game because of the girls, I bought the game because it's a solitaire game. I even lowered the girls' voice because they were pitched a little too high and that sometimes, I was under the impression that they were making sexual sounds.

Putting that aside, I was quite suprised by the quality of the UI and the strategy-side for that solitaire version. Indeed, you must put the cards in their piles, but in order and don't think it's just a matter of Ace - 2  - 3 etc. until finishing by the King, that's only your first pile. The seconde one is 2-4-6, etc. (add always +2), the third was 3-6-9 etc. (add always +3) and the fourth is 4-8-Q, etc.. (add +4). But you must always finish by the King. However, each card you draw must be either put in the pile or aside and you begin to block your cards because you're only allowed a certain number of piles aside. I will say that each game is doable because you have either expose the next five cards, move a blocked card or shuffling the cards that are aside. However, if you want to do it without any of these helps, this is where the strategy part begins to be important.

You have 5 difficulties: very easy but it doesn't count in unlocking new girls or clothes or achievements, easy, normal, hard and very hard. The difficulty resides in the fact that you have less and less possibilities to set cards aside. While in very hard, you don't have any achievements to win without help, for easy and normal, it's quite doable but in hard, it took me I d on't know how many tries, though when I unlocked it, it was pure luck that I was able to put a strategy in the middle of my game (I've given up to try something in the beginning). But seriously, it's quite annoying when the game decides that all your 10 are drawn in the first 20 seconds of the game....

The game is very well polished and in the end, the girls aren't counting because you want to be able to win your hands without help if possible.

For the price, you get a casual game you can enjoy for some hours.",0,1
"《secret agent~骑校忍者物语~》是ensemble（音符社）推出的一款校园恋爱类型视觉小说。向来画女硬说男的音符社在本作中有所保守，并未突出过多的伪娘元素，这倒是令我有些意外。身为忍者后裔的御影迅，因执行调查任务而潜入「冬华学园」，也因此结识了同班同学 カノン、学妹 雨之森、骑士 白钟神乐以及骑士团团长 莲城寺舞；在这个过程中，却因某个意外事件暴露身份，调查任务岌岌可危...

介于这是音符社的作品，游玩时总感觉它能给我来点伪娘，总是有些出戏。但《骑校忍者物语》实际上仅仅是校园恋爱galgame，除去男主的忍者身份与骑士，并没有太多的惊艳点。四个女主角之间，倒是白发大姐姐莲城寺舞足够吸引我的目光，大概是长在xp上了。

游戏并不支持中文，游玩时可以去互联网上找民汉玩。如果本身的英文能力足够好，那倒是记得去下载额外内容。

"I am giving a positive review because I feel like with enough time and polish, this game or a future game could well made.
This game does seem to play well with the horror elements and I can see heavy inspiration from early Slender type games.
The feeling of being hunted down is well realized, and the general atmosphere is good.


What this game is lacking are a few distinct things as well things to improve upon are as follow:

  [u]Landmarks or a compass[/u]
       Besides the obvious gate and campsite, the world lacks any sort of physical landmarks to 
       which to base your direction upon. And I often found myself stuck wandering around 
       aimlessly. 

  [u]World Design[/u]
       The world is flat with no terrain design and often feels like I'm not actually in a forest 
       because of the forest floor not being well realized, lacking flora besides the copy and 
       pasted tree asset many times over. With that said, I also became stuck on the hitboxes of 
       trees or had to completely redirect myself because of said problem.

  [u]Monster/Character Design[/u]
       Frankly the design of the monster is silly. When I would slow down long enough to allow 
       the monster to come close enough to peek out of the darkness, I would just end up 
       laughing at the ugly thing lumbering towards me. Also, I like the idea of you knowing that 
       the monster is getting close because of the music, but I feel like another ambient sound 
       would be a better choice over music.


I hope you guys continue to work hard on game design and continue to impress!",0,1

Fun Fact: 9 out of 10 Gamblers quit right before hitting the jackpot and winning a million bajillion dollars,0,1
"EDIT: The Developer has provided some much-needed context to the decisions they made, which you can read in their response. They have even already addressed one of my concerns- the fact that you started turn 1 with no resources, and are unable to play most cards. They seem to be hard at work to make the game better, so I hope this game has a bright future ahead of it. My original review is preserved below, in it's entirety.

I feel very conflicted about this game. On the one hand, the depth of strategy is quite interesting- the mechanics of having most cards be able to generate resources if they stick around on the field, needing to balance your spending of resources so your opponent cannot summon their Reaper before you and subsequently one-shot you, while also making sure your resource generating cards are not just decimated by your opponent are quite fun. 

On the other hand, there are certain things about this game that I... simply do not understand. Why do you start the first turn with no resources to spend whatsoever? You can't play any cards, both players literally just have to pass turn, discarding whatever cards were in their opening hand. Why is the Harvest step at the END of the turn, rather than the beginning of each turn? This would alleviate the previous concern, as both players WOULD have resources they can spend. And why is it such a slog to get cards in this game? I know you can build a deck out of any in-season cards, even if you do not actually have them, but is that always going to be the case? Why does the game talk about ""burning"" your rewards to ""maintain scarcity""? Why wouldn't I want a large amount of cards in circulation in order to get cards I need for my deck more easily? Is there supposed to be a system where you can buy and sell your cards/unopened packs? There seems to be an interface for it, but it does not, as far as I am aware, function at all. How can I get tokens, which the game tells me I need to purchase booster packs, since there seems to be no way to earn tokens in game (at least in part due to the aforementioned trading system seemingly not working), and no way to purchase tokens with real money through the game either?

Maybe I missed something important, but this just feels to me like some sort of Crypto/NFT game, just with the Crypto/NFT functionality ripped out so the game can be listed on Steam. If it is, this would not be the first time someone has done this to get their game listed. If it is not, this game is still an absolute slog to try to gather any cards in, which is important if you want to play a deck that has any out-of-season cards. Though I should also note, there currently seems to be no way to obtain out-of-season cards, except from other players, and I have already stated that system seems to not be working as far as I can tell.

Despite the interesting gameplay, I would have to say I don't recommend this game. There are just too many obstacles to enjoyment here. I know this is a free-to-play game, but there are free-to-play card games out there that are much easier for building a deck in, and you cannot even pay money to get cards faster here.",0,1

"First of, I really admire that a single person was able to develop this game. This is really a great effort and achievement, and I find it fascinating to have such skills.

Regardless of this aspect, I must say that Stranger is not really my game. The story of defending against a home invader is interesting and also a bit scary. However, the game concept is a bit too simple for my taste: You need to spot the Stranger, then place two locks on the side of the house the Stranger is coming from. When the two windows are locked successfully, the Stranger leaves, the clock advances by one hour, and a new 'round' begins. This process repeats until 6am in the morning. During each round, you also need to switch on the light again and turn off the television. This is basically it.

For players who would like to finish a game on any level of difficulty, this is perhaps interesting, but I personally prefer rather playing a game in easy or standard mode but enjoying more content. And the content is just not really there in my opinion.

Granted, the game is very affordable, but I would be surprised if anyone plays it for more than 2-3 hours. I felt like I had seen pretty much everything after 20-30 minutes aleady and will likely not return to play.",1,0

The problem is that the combat is the only gameplay there is. Adult scenes are just unlocks in a gallery. There are no cinematics or any story to speak of.

"Eight new songs from various genres and artists are included in the Essential Hits Pack, an intriguing piece of downloadable content for the game. Despite not really fitting with the game's content, several of the tracks I feel suit surprisingly well with the gameplay and flow.

[b]What benefits does the DLC offer?[/b]
[list]
[*]There are now eight additional tunes in the game from various genres, giving the player more options.
[*]Six of the eight tracks, in my opinion, go well with the gameplay and flow of the game.
[/list]

[b]What was lacking in the DLC?[/b]
[list]
[*]The majority of the songs don't fit the game's concept at all.
[*]I thought two of the tracks were terribly monotonous and tedious.
[*]I personally find it challenging to follow the beat of Paramore's song Misery Business with any kind of weapon due to it's extremely fast pace whilst also trying to juggle other things.
[*]For individuals who aren't interested in various musical genres, it might be a little too pricey.
[*]The new tracks don't have music layering, thus your fury won't affect the song the way it did for the other tracks in the base game and Dream of the Beast DLC.
[*]It is extremely risky to stream the new tracks because of potential DMCA legal action as the tunes are licensed.
[*]The DLC feels that compared to the prior DLC, which provided additional tracks, weapons, and outfits at a lower price, it doesn't actually give much for the price. The tracks from the Dream of the Beast DLC also included the layering function.
[/list]

Overall, I really like the most of the songs this DLC offers, so for me, it was just about worth the purchase. Even though I liked it, I personally can't suggest it because the negatives far outweigh the positives in my opinion. If you enjoy some of the new musical tracks, I definitely suggest purchasing the DLC when it becomes available on sale. The DLC strikes me as a little odd because the game was developed on the base of metal music, which is literally reflected in the title, and its primary target audience is metal enthusiasts. The game's themes are also very much in line with the metal theme, but not so much with the others. Nonetheless, it's a good idea to test whether other genres might work with this type of game. Although this was a good idea, I personally hope they stick with metal music for future material and that this is simply a filler DLC while they work on something that has more depth.

Edit: For some reason it says I have 0.0 hours on the game which has to be an error on Steams part. I currently have 46.8 hours at the time of this review.",1,0
"I could spend a lot of time writing words about this, but the short version is that I am the target audience for this game. I love old-school RPGs. I love weird SaGa-style jank in my games. This game came out on my birthday, even! It is laser-targeted at me, specifically.

And it's not very fun.

The short version is that nothing really matters. There's no real decision-making to do, outside of class selection - and class selection does not really matter that much because most of them feel pretty much the same. They will randomly get skills, which may or may not help you. There's mechanics for certain types of damage, but many of the moves won't give you any indication of what ""type"" of damage they do, so you just kinda have to figure it out. Some of the skills provide buffs or debuffs, but they never seem to do anything meaningful.

Monsters also scale with your level, so it never feels like you're accomplishing anything. You are, but the only things you actually need to be able to do are to clear the fixed fights. None of the other fights matter, and the game agrees, because you have a 100% flee rate.

There are other mechanics - I think ambushes exist, but I have no idea what they do and they didn't seem to matter. There are treasure chests, but they don't really do anything outside of modify stats, and it never seems to be enough to be meaningful, so there's no reason to give a shit about them.

The game also does not respect your time in the slightest. You want a specific class (or monster, in the second half of the game)? No, you can't pick from a list; you reject every single other thing until you get the thing you want. You want to turn off the movement animations so going through the dungeon is faster on return trips? Nope. The filter hurts your eyes? Too bad.

The second half of the game is particularly unenjoyable as someone who is familiar with Wizardry IV. Monsters having random skills (which you cannot see before you select them; again, the game does not respect your time) makes it very frustrating to actually get a composition you like without monsters having filler skills, because you do not control your monsters. That combined with the sudden ""go back to start if you die, and also lose your stats/skills/etc"", unlike the first half of the game, feels even worse. Changing the rules of the game arbitrarily sucks and feels bad.

I've also found at least two bugs: cursor location is saved between the first battle menu and the party menu, so if you flee a battle (which is the fourth option)... your cursor, if you go to the party screen, will be on ""save and exit"", which is a very good way to accidentally quit the game.

During the second half of the game, you also appear to be able to remove the Demon Lord from the party and have him join the guards. The game doesn't act like anything is unusual when you do this, but all fights after that point will be fully automatic, because you do not control whoever the ""first"" party member is at that point. If you actually defeat the heroes after removing Leinad from your party, the game will also crash, rendering the game unwinnable. So don't do that.

There is a good concept here, and that's why I'm so frustrated by it. There is the hint of something really cool here, and I really, really wanted it to be good! I was really excited by it! But it's just a slog with very little payoff for anything.",1,0

"Interesting puzzle mechanic with some added fluff; simple, clean controls; music is nice but the same melody played over and over gets too repetitive fast. The ""scenes"" are fun but feel generic, i'd suggest to the dev maybe for a patch later on to create more scenes and somehow string them together (visually, that is) after the completion of each level... but again, that's just fluff.
The puzzle itself relies on 3 simple rules (loop, straight, and curved lines) regarding how you connect the sprinklers (straight and curved ones) until you close the loop. I had fun just tackling the levels in a strictly logical way but at least for one level that I tested this, at one point simply connecting by excluding illogical cases won't suffice to solve the puzzle - you'll ten have to try one or more different lineways to grab the remaining sprinklers and close the loop - and that actually adds depth and challenge to gameplay.",0,1
"I dropped Lost Ark for this... 

You probably wonder why I made this statement. Well World Seed has all the things you would probably enjoy in all those f2p/mobile ""mmo"" games. Character progression to infinity, builds, random (kinda) gear drops. Some exploration. Co-op dungeons/bosses. But it actually is free to play on the web version, and it does not gate you with stamina refreshes, pay to get more powerfull gear/characters etc. You can play as much as you want, whenever you want.

You start from the center of the map, get some gear drops to increase your item level. Then you go out to the higher level areas, get higher level gear, and repeat. It is grindy. You will not reach the crazy hundrends of thousands dmg/item-level fast. And I must admit it might get repetive. Not sure, I still have lots of fun on my fourth area. Combat is automatic, your character(s) trade blows with the enemie(s) untill someone retreates or dies. There are some elemental effects you can have on your gear, but it is simple. Better numbers result in victory. If you die you lose your character, and whatever he is wearing. And start with a new one of your choice again. It is not that bad, early game at least, because you can get some materials and craft the gear pretty fast again. Unlesss you had some mats laying arround in your bank (you probably have). There are no character levels, everything is about gear. There are coop dungeons for special loot also, but you will probably spent most of the time exploring and grinding gear. 

This is all I have experienced so far, and allready loving the game. It will be my chill farming, rpg game. And it can be totally free if you want to, I chose to purchase it on steam to support the dev. Personally got tired of the time gating mechanics of the f2p model games, and their shenanigans to get me hooked. This game fits like a glove on that place of my steam library. And will gladly spent money on it again, as long as I play it.

Really looking forward to see where the development of World Seed will get it.",0,1

"Overall, this is a really clever logic game, and the sequential illustrations on the card are kinda brilliant. I'd guess that this game had a budget of less than $50,000 and [b]it is definitely one of the best I've played in that budget level[/b]. The AI is genuinely pretty fierce, especially on kraken. If you like Clue at all, I think this uses similar deduction skills. 


NOTE: The game could probably be clearer on what happens when the kraken picks multiple numbers. While the kraken CAN select more than 1 number per turn, you will only receive positive information back if the enemy has played *all* of the numbers you've selected. As a result, when you're playing kraken, most turns you probably should be picking just one number. 

...

Notes for designers: in my own playthroughs with the AI, it feels like it's a lot easier to win with the kraken. If your own analytics bear that out, I have a few ideas...

--Maybe the kraken only needs 1 card on the first turn. Or, if the kraken draws 2 cards on the first turn, maybe they shouldn't ever be connected like 6-7 for example. (I suspect that getting connected numbers on the first turn is a major RND win for kraken. It gives the kraken a ton of information on what opening number to select and creates 1-2 turns where the squid is more likely to hit a number than normal).  

--Over a few hours of gameplay, the AI diver seems to be very reluctant to play overcharges, and I'm guessing they mainly overcharge when a normal 2-3 advance is not available. And the AI diver seems to hardly ever mix in false overcharges, even in the super-late-game when the card cost on a false overcharge might not matter. The AI kraken has a very good grasp on how to shut down a diver who goes for +3 or +2 almost exclusively. (If you're playing kraken and don't have any information suggesting whether they have attempted a +1, +2 or +3 advance, blindly assuming it's +3 is probably safest because the diver is probably losing on plays where they only get +1 or +2. The diver's on a limited clock before the kraken has gathered so much information that they can reliably lock him out). The AI diver does not have a good grasp on how not to get shut down by the kraken usually assuming it was a +3. (If there is viable counterplay for the diver, it's probably some degree of overcharge bluffing or strategically mixing in slower moves, but the kraken seems to reach the lockdown point a bit quickly so strategically mixing in slower moves might not be viable). 

--It appears that the diver is guaranteed to have 1-2-3 in his opening hand. If so, perhaps some randomization so that a player only gets 2 of these at the start (and then some other other card instead of the third) might open up higher-reward lines of diver play. (I'd eliminate the third one from the deck because it's either a dead draw for the diver or a draw which gives the kraken too much information about the diver's starting hand). Alternately, allowing the diver to mulligan some of his opening numbers and draw some new ones might speed up the diver's early play a bit.

--The kraken probably doesn't need the ability to pick three numbers in a turn. If the kraken can choose up to three numbers, that punishes the diver for +1 turns. If the diver has somehow lived long enough to sow so much confusion that the kraken needs to choose three numbers, the diver deserves to win.

--Maybe the diver could be told what cards the kraken has drawn? This makes it a bit easier to avoid stumbling into game-ending traps. 

--If the diver is able to play the final card, the squid should not get a guess-until-you-lose mechanic to save the game. Like 90% of divers die before playing the final card. If the diver plays the final card, the diver deserves to win. 

--In playthroughs against AI, it seems like the diver usually dies or is hopelessly crippled in the first 5-6 cards. As kraken, I guess 3 on my opening bid most of the time, and *either* I find one of the diver's first two cards (which is kind of crippling) or I find that he is slow-playing from the start of the game, which pretty much guarantees he'll die before I'm in any danger.",0,1

"With the existence of song modding it can be bit difficult to justify DLC that's purely made up of licensed songs. Personally I like all the songs they included, and I want to support the game, so buying the pack was a no-brainer for me.
But I can also see that people that were drawn to the game because of it's OST, or people who's listening preferences are purely in the realm of metal-adjacent genres might not be fans of majority of them, which means they'd still be paying for songs that they don't care about or even really want in their game.

This is one of those cases where Steam's binary yes/no recommendation system doesn't really work imo, because whether or not you should consider buying this DLC is purely dependent on your own subjective opinion of the songs included in it.",0,1

"Not sure if they broke this game or not. Its spawning multiple groups of mobs on the first encounters wiping the party out. The starting characters also don't have any starting funds or equipment. So you have to try a suicide run without and hope you get back out. This isn't quite what the original was about but okay. First level is supposed to be easy not plow you off the start. That's for level 2. Will continue to update but so far its not really any fun. May uninstall, I'm not sure yet as I'm only 10 hours in so hard to say. Music and graphics are good, The game play is not enjoyable though.
Update: I'm another 26 hours in. That first level is still off the chain. I've been down to level 6 and have encountered 0 fights of equal difficulty since level 1. It might be the nature of the beast on how the encounters are developed. Maps are challenging along with the enemies. ""Instakill"" hasn't been too much of an issue yet compared to the original. The high level ninjas in the original would wipe you out. not so much on this one. Overall level 1 is harder than the original. The next 5 id say are challenging but more balanced (still taking fatalities) . But i will say its gotten more enjoyable now I'm past the level 1 created character chipper. Its still stings to roll for an hour just for the advanced character party to wipe out. its the only con right now. ",0,1

You see the world, now in the wake of the KN028 virus having ravaged it and turned millions into zombies, through Alfred’s eyes and suffering is the life many are all too familiar with… He wakes up one day to find his brother Jake has gone to seek out one “Captain Jack” who’s supposedly taking in survivors. Antsy that the worst has happened, he sets out to catch up to his only family before it’s too late ~


[h1][u][+] PROS;[/u][/h1]

[h1]:) A-HA, SEE WHATCHU DID THERE. I’LL TAKE YOU ON~[/h1]
Plays somewhat like a mutated sister of [b]Resident Evil’s (RE)[/b] tank control and [b]Silent Hill’s (SH)[/b] 3D over-the-shoulder camera! A welcome change that then immediately plunges you into familiar territory as well as mechanics like having precious ink ribbons to save progress, storage boxes, green herbs to munch on… or snort. Well, you get the picture; an obvious homage that doesn’t bother to cover its tracks.

There are even minuscule brain teasers such as cracking number combinations, the now-obligatory sliding picture puzzle, way-finding to proceed to the next area, and the usual birds and the bees of survival! You should be right at home with the combat seeing as it gets the job done despite being otherwise elementary and not going overboard on the weapon variety.

The first run occupies roughly 3 hours on account of the hard-hitting zombies and a handful of careless deaths. $2 for a RE-like title seems overly generous, but alas there’s a catch- several in fact. See you in the cons~

[u]TIPS:[/u]
1) Knife can stun-lock the zombie goons.


[h1]:) PLAYS YOU LIKE A FIDDLE, BUT THAT’S OK… FOR THE MOST PART.[/h1] 
The low-poly graphics grant it that dose of PS1 nostalgia which would’ve been enough to sway your judgement, but the list of locations you’re to frequent; however little the actual resemblances give it that extra kick of reminiscence towards the named survival horror games regardless! The vacant city streets are grand and disorderly, their presence only extending onto the areas you’re to frequent. Whether it be a derelict apartment building where hope goes to inhabit before committing suicide, a police station that’s seen better days just longing for crime, a hospital so desperate for patients it will inflict- so on and so forth.

I appreciated and adored the sound design more than anything it had to offer visually… It complemented the loneliness and deathly silent atmosphere by having you walk-run with either nothing but the noises you make or the snarls of zombies. RE/SH-ish music only materializes out of thin air in safe rooms (if even then), boss encounters, jumpscares, and when Alfred literally whips out his instrument to strum away and sing a tune~

[h1]:) A NIGHTMARE… RE-CREATED!? Z FOR YOURSELF![/h1]
The plot is largely exempt of any profound influences and probably the most original out of everything! That said, the searching for family plot line gave me throwbacks to [b]RE2[/b] & [b]SH (1999)[/b]; the looking for a safe haven- [b]RE Afterlife[/b]. The minutely open-world design of a city in ruins recalled specific instances of [b]SH Origins[/b], [b]The Last of Us[/b], and [b]I Am Legend[/b]. Seems like a lot of watered-down caricatures, but they didn’t come off as such. It appeared to genuinely attempt (emphasis on this) to tell a heartfelt story that could rival even [b]The Walking Dead[/b] only more close-knit and small-scale~


[h1][u][-] CONS;[/u][/h1]

[h1]:( MORE LIKE, THE DEAD AREN’T ALL DEAD!?[/h1]
While I’m most thankful the narrative isn’t as heavily plagiarized as their previous entry[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadeGuard98/recommended/2363930/] Evil Is Back[/url], which by the way they’ve gotten away with, this time they’ve reached a new low… What’d they do? Well, they copied RE & SH in a “style over substance” manner and once more have to lean on nostalgia for crutches! This particular endeavor grossly reminded me of[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadeGuard98/recommended/1978010/] Delivery Man (DM)[/url], which was yet another game averse to the word “new” and inserted only what they themselves thought were the most telling elements of what made a RE title!

This naturally led to the existence of previously context-laden puzzles which shouldn’t otherwise belong here for they defy all logic. With the only explanation being, well, other than the fact that the OGs had them back then; ergo their inclusion is more than justified. Despite DM doing it a tinge better, both were outright starved of any worthwhile personality or memorable characters… serving solely as placeholder “remember that more interesting individual in RE/SH? Yeah, good times”.


[h1]:( ON THE MAP ALRIGHT- FOR DIFFERENT INFERIOR REASONS.[/h1]
I was feeling the locations initially, but variety did JAKE all in taking away from the reality that they were subpar in their dressing and layout. I thought the apartment was the biggest offender with rooms that differed little to none from each other. But really, every single area was ridiculously spacious and identical in their environmental storytelling thanks to repeating props… Almost as if to exclaim “forget interesting set pieces, we just need places to pad the runtime” which becomes gospel in the next cons~


[h1]:( NOT ON THE RIGHT… BACKTRACK![/h1]
You would think “RE-esque title” and “fun” are synonymous, well think again; the latter is aggressively as well as aggravatingly replaced by long bouts of backtracking. Sheer amount of plot-bending done to allow for key items to be found in places that, in a sane world, would have zero chances of being associated! This key with no discernible markers whatsoever must open that locked door from halfway across the city…! DUH!!

The bullet sponge bosses painfully drain the fun out of the very sad amount there already was. To add insult to injury? 2/3 of bosses could’ve been easily bypassed by simply ignoring them had you been permitted to use your brain. It’s only cause the game forces you to deal with them by making that completely unobstructed gap and the door that wasn’t locked suddenly inaccessible. Lastly, the degree of inventory stupidity going on whereby picking up similar items don’t automatically pool them together and so you have to slow travel to safe rooms to dump your crap. It’s just a whole thing to artificially pad the runtime in terms of gameplay~

[h1]:( CLEAN UP YOUR ACT. PRETTY PLEASE!?[/h1]
Put simply, Twitch streamers rarely make for good voice actors. There, said it! At least pick the semi-decent ones much like[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadeGuard98/recommended/2026870/] Night at the Gates of Hell[/url] did. If I wanted disinterested & soulless reads that border on hilarity, I would just view an adult film~


[h1]BUGS:[/h1]
x Entering a new area, the camera does this thing where it flies towards the player-
x 2 of 3 bosses can be exploited through environmental means.
x Alfred clips with certain objects
x Camera stutters when touching the environment
x Textures keep changing place…
x Auto-aim disabled when an object gets in your way.


[h1]NITPICKS:[/h1]
~ Gun reloads automatically…!
~ Map opacity is terrible.
~ “Files” menu has more slots than there are notes! Misleading.
~ Short black screens after QTEs are jarringly intrusive.


[h1]""DON’T MEAN IT’S EXCUSED FROM A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED RIBBON!!?""[/h1]

[u]Last Words?[/u]
Scarily basic survival horror that bares too much of its muses… Save for a few scraps of novelty & sincerity; winds up feeling derivative, ill thought out, and rushed. “Affordable” came at a price~

Before i start iam pretty sad it changed from Pve to PvpPve game and the game is very plain so far by playing the play test and have encounted a lot of campers at spawn points and so far ive played a couple of game and all but one I've been killed just as i load in. I would recommend they add two game modes of Pvp and Pve as this would give a choice for the players who dislike and like different parts of the game which may end up making this game extremely popular,1,0
"I played this game a lot when it originally came out. I hope I can figure out how to make it recognize my controller. I'm not great with keyboard controls, and when it switches to the battles I really need that. Its a turn based strategy game that also requires your skill in battle to win the location, and once you (or they) find your ""Orb keeper"" and beat them its over. You have several traps and types of pieces with different abilities to choose from, with points to buy whichever ones you want. So both sides will most likely not have exactly they same ones. If any of you have played Archon Ultra, in some ways its similar, where you each move pieces around the board(in this case landscape) and you have to win the battles to take any square, its not like chess where you going there means you win it.  If you like turned based, with some fighting to actually take the spots, you should check it out.",0,1

"The review will be based off Day/Night single fairy girl (the first one) only.

I played the first game in the series and this one...  Did some changes.  At first the language is far better than the first one, but later on...  It gets really strange.  Although I gotta say...  You can have a blast with that too.  I have questions such as ""how do you shut your ""sp*rm""?""  And am I the only one freaked out with the male tool being compared to a ""baby's arm""...?

Also I have to say that the outfit the Night female is wearing...  If she had underwear...  Black, lacy underwear?  She would look better...  That little strip is freaking me out!  Males probably don't even see or notice it, as they are too busy with something else, but meh.  I had to say it somewhere.

There is no more ""shake mouse up and down"" to progress the lewd scene AFTER completing both Day/Night.  No.  Now you can control the speed + the scene.  There is also NO BATTLE MODE...  I mean...  There is something...  But I think it's just for setting a high score...?  You can't grow your own fairy anymore.  :(

While in the first F2P you will get maybe around 10 achievements (maybe)...  This one you get two.

You still play the ""Clover Enlargement Game"" and know this: In DAY story ->  The game is spot on and easier to play.  At NIGHT -> You BARELY get any extra damage!  My tactic was for the character to die as soon as possible, so you can acquire a sheep ton of ""psionic energy"" (...?) and then keep blasting that Fairy!  After doing the mini-game that is.  It's weird, but otherwise you will be going for a while and guess what...?  YOUR CHARACTER WILL DIE ANYWAY!

Also with the language...  The names keep switching...  So the woman might have the guy's name and vice versa.  At one point the guy says he has a ""female part"" and I am not sure how air can be ""crunchy""...  But that was funny too...

Thanks for the fun...  The pretty CGs and the mini-games...  Hah...!  :3 =) :>

"[u][b]What is Sunny Love:[/b][/u] A lewd visual novel

[u][b]Summary:[/b][/u] [i]Sunny Love is a simple, short visual novel. Without giving away too much of the story, you play as a man with a camera. You meet up with a girl who is very...""photogenic"". There are a few endings based a few choices you have to make, but it's all just an excuse for the sex scenes. Read through the banter and make a choice when presented with one. If you end up with the bad ending like I did the first time around, you can just replay. It's short. There are about 8 non-animated sex scenes. The art-style here is so-so. It's 3D hentai which always has the potential to look a bit, off. And in some cases, it does. Her sex parts look nice tho! It's her face that is a bit off. But you probably won't pay much attention to her face.

At $9.99 I would say it strikes me as a bit pricey for a game with literally no gameplay, but I did receive this game for free for review, so I can't tell you if I have buyer's remorse. Overall it's not a bad little visual novel. It gets to the point and doesn't drag on too long. You can also click as fast as you can and fly through the text if you just wanna fap, but I honestly can't recommend it for the $10 price tag. There are hentai games with much more to offer for much less money. [/i]

"This game is just ""fine"" and im gonna explain my reasons.
-First of all, i have to be honest: the art is amazing. The only exception are the eyes animations when they narrow and expand, but the rest of the art is amazing, so congratulations!
-The soundtrack is also really good. I liked all the tracks.
The core of the plot is fine, surpassing the bad times and fighting against yourself, but here are the bad things:
-The game is too short, really short. I had no time to feel anything with the main character, nor Hina or Rei.
-The endings are really dissapointing. I won´t spoil anything, but in the end, you won´t see anything. Its a bad conclusion
-There a lack of different choices. The decisions you make just change some dialogues, but those decisions won´t affect the story.
Just as conclusion: you have potential. Your art is amazing. You should have to improve your writing or you could hire some good screenwriter and you´d work just in the art, but i recommend you to follow the path you want.

"Una estética congelada que no logra descongelar las mecánicas limitadas

ANYU prometía ser un viaje visualmente impresionante en un mundo congelado, pero desafortunadamente, no logró cumplir plenamente sus promesas. El juego presenta una estética hermosa y relajante, y la narrativa de exploración en tercera persona tenía el potencial de cautivar a los jugadores. Sin embargo, las limitaciones en las mecánicas de juego, la problemática cámara y el frustrante softlock que experimenté afectaron significativamente mi disfrute general.

Comencemos con lo positivo: el aspecto visual de ANYU es verdaderamente destacable. Los paisajes árticos y la ambientación helada crean una atmósfera cautivadora que invita a la exploración. Los detalles meticulosos en los remanentes de la antigua civilización y los efectos visuales, como las luces del norte, añaden un toque de encanto a la experiencia. El juego logra transmitir una sensación de tranquilidad y serenidad a través de su estética, lo cual es innegablemente atractivo.

Sin embargo, esta belleza visual no puede compensar las mecánicas de juego básicas y repetitivas. Los puzzles de movimiento y las mecánicas de entorno carecen de originalidad y profundidad. Las acciones requeridas se repiten una y otra vez, lo que da lugar a una sensación de monotonía y falta de desafío. Esperaba que el juego ofreciera una variedad más amplia de acertijos y mecánicas para mantener mi interés a lo largo de la aventura, pero lamentablemente esto no se materializó.

Además, la cámara del juego es un aspecto problemático. Su posición desplazada a la derecha del jugador resulta incómoda y dificulta la visibilidad y la navegación efectiva. Constantemente tuve que ajustar mi enfoque y me encontré luchando contra la cámara para obtener una perspectiva clara del entorno. Esta deficiencia en el diseño de la cámara interfiere con la inmersión y la experiencia fluida que debería brindar un juego de exploración.

El momento más decepcionante fue cuando me quedé softlockeado en una parte del juego. En un momento crucial de la historia, me encontré atrapado sin poder avanzar. Intenté todas las soluciones posibles y exploré minuciosamente el entorno, pero parecía que había alcanzado un punto muerto. Este obstáculo imprevisto frustró mi experiencia y afectó mi conexión con la narrativa y el mundo de ANYU.

En conclusión, a pesar de su estética bonita y relajante, ANYU se ve limitado por mecánicas básicas y repetitivas, una cámara problemática y la experiencia desalentadora de quedarse softlockeado. Aunque la belleza visual inicialmente llama la atención, no puede ocultar las deficiencias fundamentales del juego. Si bien algunos jugadores pueden encontrar cierto disfrute en la experiencia relajante que ofrece, para aquellos que buscan un desafío más profundo y una jugabilidad más pulida, ANYU puede quedarse corto en sus expectativas. Espero que los desarrolladores tomen en cuenta estas críticas constructivas y realicen mejoras significativas en futuras actual",0,1
"it's a really cute and unique game, but the map is a little too big to hit your friends so most of the time you'll get stunned by the map instead. The game gets boring relatively quick, and there isn't much to the game besides pushing the yarn. I hope the game will continue to develop because I can see it turning into a fun party game with friends.",0,1
This game is similar to hang man. The object of the game is to crack the word by guessing words  and hopefully finding out what the word is. It is a bit difficult to play if you are good at word games you will probably have no issues. It was fun to play for a bit but it is a bit repetitive and I found myself becoming bored of it after about 30 mins of game play. The price is good for this style game and I would recommend it to word buffs. I would give this a 5/10 because it doesn't hold interest for very long and is a bit too repetitive for me.,1,0

"GunDeck[100] is challenging, but feels beatable so I keep coming back after each failed run. The RNG aspect is what makes the game very replayable because each run has different drops and a different order of enemies. I keep coming back, hoping to get the perfect drops that fit my playstyle and can allow me to beat all of the levels.

My least favorite aspect of the game are the rounds that start immediately. There are times where I have been hit immediately after selecting a drop. It may be part of the challenge, but I still find it very annoying when it happens.

One feature that would be nice to have is summary of the boosts/stats that you've picked up. The deck icons help, but the stats each drop provides isn't always equal and there are times when I would like to know where I'm at with just a glance.",0,1

"It's free so it's an easy recommend. You don't even have to register with any 3rd party site to play (although it keeps track of your scores if you do). You can play against AI, but the AI is pretty dumb and you can just be offsides the entire match and your AI teammates will always try to pass you the ball, no matter where you are. So basically, you have to be offsides for easy goals. I don't recommend this game for single player.

However, multiplayer is obviously where this is at. There seems to be a fair number of people in MP. It may be fun, but after trying out the single player modes (there's a few available), I was dead tired from the locomotion. It's basically the same movement from Gorilla Tag, if you're not aware, it's sort of like arm swing locomotion except you kick yourself off the ground by your hands hitting the ground. 

So it involves a lot of physical exertion to run up and down the pitch (soccer field for us Americans). Honestly, I don't know how anyone can play a full match having to use this locomotion method. I definitely think this game is made for young kids to just exhaust themselves. This game is perfect for the VR mom or dad who wants their little one to go to bed after 30 minutes of playing this.

"The game itself is a perfectly fine autorunner. There's not a lot here, but what is here is solid. For 3 bucks, it's exactly what you pay for.

Below is my old review and has since been outdated. I'm keeping it here for record purposes..

That said, I'm giving this a negative review for bad faith advertisement.
-The capsule shows a realistic looking man, but the in game doesn't fit the game at all. If he's the protagonist, I can hardly tell.
-This game is an Autorunner and NOTHING in ""About"" section says that. Even the trailer doesn't say that. I thought it was just a small platformer, but once I found out they removed the means to let me control the character, I'm not interested. If other people want an autorunner, that's fine, but the steam page should say that.
-Also, because it's an auto runner, it says ""Simple two-button controls"", implying it's jump and attack. However, there's 3 buttons because the range attack you get in some levels has its own button. This is a nitpick

I don't want to sound harsh to a 3 dollar game. I just think it's wrong when it feels like the steam page is hiding key information. I'll give the developer the benefit of the doubt and assume it wasn't intentional, but I'm still refunding this game. Not because it's bad, but because I don't like autorunners. If the steampage changes to make it clear it's an autorunner, I'll switch this recommend.",0,1

"Disappointing that some animations are just re-used and the only thing changing are the characters, so instead of a 12 h-gallery, there is only really 8 different ones. 

BJ animations are also kind of broken as well since the pickle clips through the mouth. Gameplay is kind of fun though.

For the price, it's not bad and the devs seem to care, since they fixed quite a bit of issues the day after it released, so here's to hoping that the game doesn't get abandoned. They posted a text roadmap, so there may be hope.",0,1

"Very repetitive music, and varying difficulty across the game's 20 levels. Final level was way too easy in my opinion. Overall, the game was challenging but not impossible. Could be a good lesson in patience, problem solving, and staying calm for people who have issues with that sort of thing.

"For what seems to be a starter project using an interesting concept, the game is enjoyable enough. The price could be argued, but I felt $3 for a game that took work from the creator was fair, even if that time was only a month. I'm hoping the funds from this game will be used to create future works that are longer and more complex than what's presented in this game. To that end, I don't feel like I threw away money, and I won't be asking for a refund. There are however, issues with the game as far as actual game play goes, so here's a few gripes I had, which MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:

//Potential Spoilers//
In the game, you're occasionally haunted by a spirit. Now, there was a part near the end that required the spirit to hand you a coin, used to unscrew some bolts. The appearance of the hand, at least in my play through, seemed linked to the time limit, and NOT to any actions I had taken. This, along with a part whereby I tried to move the same piece several times, but then was suddenly able to move it halfway through the game, leads me to believe the puzzles are locked behind a time limit, and you can only access certain parts past certain time limits. This is unfortunate, as it made me feel frustrated to realize my solutions SHOULD have been working, but because the time hadn't ticked down enough, the puzzles wouldn't solve. I understand that by doing this, the panic of the time limit sets in more, creating tension, however, if a player has tried a puzzle and failed, they are unlikely to keep trying it over and over just to check if it works yet.

However, it could also have been linked to glitching, as there was an instance where clicking the 4 key lock box as it was being placed on my lap caused it to return to it's original spot, and clicking it again zoomed the camera in on my lap area where the lock box SHOULD have been to place the keys in, but due to the glitch, it was lodged over by the wall still, and I had to restart the game entirely to correct it. Being that the game is short, this wasn't too much of an issue, aside from the fact you can't skip the opening dialog.
//End of Spoilers//

All in all, it was enjoyable enough for $3, and the puzzles do change to some degree if you play through multiple times. Here's hoping we see more in depth content from the creator in the future, but hats off for a starter project.",0,1

"Basic tower defense where you only have to worry about one unit. The cheap price hides unbalaced difficulty and low content.

The goal is to protect your castle from invading enemies. You can only purchase an archer to post on the castle walls and a warrior to walk in a straight line towards the enemy. The warrior is largely ineffective because it dies quickly and is expensive to summon. 

You have place for four extra archers in addition to the hero archer who is always on the walls. Because that's a small number that can easily be overrun, you also have three magical powers at your disposal that can strike a specific area of the battlefield for a few seconds.

It could be ice, poison, or thunder magic, but it makes no difference because they all have the same effect. However, because they take from 30-60 seconds to recharge, this is best employed in urgent situations.

Killing enemies grants you coins and tokens, which you can spend to purchase or improve archers. A unit can evolve three times. All archer evolutions, however, can be improved further between battles. A completely improved stage 1 may appear to be superior to a beginning stage 2, yet evolution is always beneficial because you obtain better arrows. These arrows can also be purchased from a shop and used as a consumable during combat.

There are 50 stages spread out throughout five provinces. Despite the fact that the attackers deploy different units, each stage plays exactly the same. The flags you obtain for performing a good job are meaningless unless you want all the achievements.

The difficulty level is unbalanced. Even if you improve everything to full power before reaching province 4, you will still be destroyed. You won't be able to keep up with the huge quantity of opponents hurled at you because you can't upgrade your magic or warriors. One way to give yourself at least a chance is to upgrade the castle, but that costs a lot of coins that you get by replaying stages for quite a while.",0,1
"Dead End City has a nice presentation as well as a good premise for a shoot 'em up that is rarely explored.  However, it's also somewhat held back with its Galaga enemy patterns, slow progression/tough unlocks and minor game play decisions for me to given it much more than a weak recommend.

Dead End City hit the player with a stunning intro and rockin' music in this post-apocalypse, Mad Max style shoot 'em up.  And it's a blast to play the first few play throughs.  However, I quickly discovered that the game doesn't seem to want the player to move their car from the bottom of the screen.  This is largely due to the Galaga inspired patterns the enemies perform as they arrive on screen and bombard the player's car.  Which is also neat until the player realizes just how much that limits their movement.  It was fine in the early 80s, but it feels so restrictive here. To be clear, the player can absolutely move their car up the screen.  It's just the game punishes them for doing so until latter half of the stage where they drive around buildings and battle bandits that are on foot.  

The next thing that initially impressed me, but quickly faded was the player car fuel is their health.  They only have the one life, but the game constantly drops fuel at them.  At least until it doesn't, it what often feels like a lose more scenario where your car is on fumes and you just can get to fuel to drop or get in position to get it.  leaving the player in a death spiral.  On the other end, the player is reward with more firepower if they can manage to keep their fuel tank topped off.  The whole system left me with the impression that mistake recovery is extremely difficult to do once the player gets a little ways into the game.  Especially since the player's special attack is also recharged from enemy drops, and oddly enough those drops often happen from using the special attack.  So, the player better be ready to get into position to catch those drops or run empty on their special attacks too.

Each run provides the player with money to spend at the in game shop that allows them to unlock art, sound tests and other drivers.  Those other drivers can also be unlocked by flawlessly defeating the end of stage boss as described in the shop.  But as of yet, I've come no where near being able to perform a no miss even on the first stage end boss.  And while I'm not great at shoot 'em ups, I do feel these challenges are a little harsh.  Especially since the amount of money my people (bad shmup players) can earn isn't much.  I'm already an hour into playing this game and nadda new drivers to play around with.  I've beaten easier STGs in that amount of time.  I don't know if I have it in me the desire to put the time and practice to unlocking these other drivers via skill or dinero.

As such, I don't really care for Dead End City.  But that's not to say the game is bad.  Far from it.  Ultimately, the game just personally rubs me the wrong way.  It doesn't just about everything to keep itself from clicking with me.  That said, I still recommend it.  It looks and sounds real nice.  The Galaga patterns are a neat throw back and not at all the whole game.  I do enjoy the parts of Dead End City where the player drives between buildings and junk just before the end of stage bosses.  I just found the game a little overly difficult to explore much of it without practice I'm not readily willing to give it.",0,1
"I like this game a lot and i like what this dlc brings to the table, the cards are a ton of fun, the new character is pretty unique, and the cosmetics look awesome HOWEVER this isn't a lot of content for the 8€ price tag. Even if everything of the previously listed things were instantly unlocked i would still find the price too much. I am honestly fine with the cards being unlockable in the same way as the base game cards, but why the skins? The cosmetics are locked behind the following things: a line of daily quests and the palprize cosmetic system. Unlocking the cosmetics from the quest line takes 15 days, assuming you do all 3 of your daily quests of course. This is a thorn in my side but if that would be it, it wouldn't bother me all that much. BUT WHY DID THEY PUT 10 COSMETICS BEHIND THE PALPRIZE!? I did the math and with the adition of these 10 cosmetics, a new player who has the dlc would have to do every daily and weekly quest FOR 18 AND A HALF WEEKS if he wanted to get every single accessory in the game. And i am pretty sure that most players spend their palprize token thingies on skins (unlocking every skin takes around 6.5 weeks). To top it off you have no way of controlling when you get the dlc stuff from the pool of 93 items. 
Again, i like the dlc content and i wish i could give it a thumbs up but i just cant. If you are interested in the cards and the character i reccomend you to buy the deluxe edition or to only buy this dlc if you want to support the devs.

"I have completed full boss rush of all decks. Here are my opinions:

Pros:
1. Great Art, Great Animations and the biggest selling point of the game. One of the reasons I didn't refund. CG's are worth the price of the game. Also. do like you don't have to complete a boss rush to get a cg for a character.
2. Majority of the decks are fun and varied that are able to win.
3. More new content coming that sounds fun.

Cons:
1. No Tutorial. Large heap of text which is a terrible way of doing it as I just found it to be information overload and had no idea what I was doing when I first played. Needs a tutorial.
2. Most likely bad introduction. The first deck I think most people will play Melonies first deck which is a board wipe big damage focuses deck but is a bad a example as it's slow imo and confusing for a new player who doesn't know what to do and can be frustrating to play. I find it can be a struggle to win boss rush with the deck. Better introduction decks are any of the other initial decks or just Deathgrip since it has an assured win condition. 
3. No advice on how to play a deck. All decks are preconstructed so you have no idea what the deck is meant to do. Most are straight forward but even just a sentence tip saying the idea of the deck and the key card would help a lot. I used a steam guide for tips on how to play and it was great.
4. 2 Decks are unbalanced imo. Melonie first deck needs a small tweak to not so slow. Last of red girls decks is almost an auto loss against Melonie I find as this deck can't heal (interesting idea) and can get overwhelmed by her high damage cards. This is really frustrating after playing through 2 rounds and finding her last. If playing this deck keep rolling until you face her first to get her out of the way. The rest you should have a good chance for (didn't lost anyone else with that deck. 
5. 1 deck is downright awful and needs to be reworked. I almost refunded the game because of this deck. Its 3rd girl's first (forest?) cat deck. The gimmick is you need to generate yourself milk cards that give you mana to use your spells. The problem is this is really as most of the deck is spells that need mana and the constant generation of milk cards clogs your hands as they waste your draws. You can destroy them to get rid of them but there goes your mana supply. The main issue with this deck is Deathgrip. I found it impossible to beat any version of her that isn't litch because litch's minions fix your resource issue by giving you mana when they die.  The other two just overwhelm you with minions as this deck is horrible at large swarms enemies and the one splash spell it has is awkward and useless mostly I find. Needs to be entirely reworked imo to include more splash cards and minion destroying cards to stop your opponent overwhelming you while also getting closer to an auto win.",0,1

"The community seems to have an extremely aggressive, hypocritical view on game updates. For example people keep screaming about wanting Geometa to fix aircraft aerodynamics, but at the same time they'd complain if Geometa did because it would inherently break every aircraft made up til now. 

While the gasses update does massively mess up pretty much everything, and it wasn't really on any player's priority list of desired features, it is a neat concept that adds an additional level of realism. For example, needing to consider the necessity of having a pressure release valve in fuel trucks is something I just came across. That being said, considering the other limitations of the game such as the unrealistic fluid dynamics, the way gasses work currently does need some tweaking. Namely, it's stupid that you can suffocate just standing around in any sealed vehicle (which makes sense for submarines, but not so much for anything else), buoyancy seems a bit out of wack, and it's kind of annoying that the various gasses mixing causes particle effects. It's clear this update was mostly intended for space/submarine creations, but it's spilled over to many other creations with unintended consequences.

I'm aware the update doesn't have much bearing on the DLC itself, which is a bit bare bones and I don't much care for the idea of, but I'm giving it a positive review and paying full price with pleasure because, in contrast with what a lot of the toxic community is saying, it's clear a decent amount of effort was put into developing the new systems and I deeply want to see this game keep going.

Side note, people complaining about normal engines not working at high altitudes need to cope. I haven't messed around with it much, but it's a realistic limitation. Especially considering the nature of the space update. Less air=less potential for combustion.

Issues that I think should be addressed

1. Otto's voice is WAY too low ... you can barely hear him
2. He gets stuck behind walls so he's a little too easy to avoid
3. It's a little buggy entering into rooms.  Sometimes when you enter a new room your character or enemies will appear momentarily in a different position and then snap back to where they should have been, which is pretty jarring
4. No remap of buttons?  Sneakybox seems to always do this on initial release and then fix it later ... WHY?!?!  LOL

If you want the original, PLAY the original.  If you want a quick play twin stick shooter with a touch of nostalgia, this does the job.

All the settings you could possibly want/need are available, including your paintbrush size, so you can essentially play however you want to play (pixel by pixel or a bigger paintbrush to colour in faster), as well as a ""click"" to fill if loads of the same colour is together.

IMO this game isn't worth the full price for the gameplay (even playing pixel by pixel), I got this at 75% off which I would say is a more accurate price range.

"Not really sure about the negative or positive, but maybe it is just not my type of game. The game is beautiful and very well made, the mechanics are simple, but the 'strategy' and 'base building' elements aren’t as important as I had hoped.

Throughout my first playthrough, I started to understand that merging buildings from lower levels to higher levels is not really how the game is played best. It is much better to just get a combo to get some cards, which gives you higher level placeable buildings and allow to move buildings around the map freely. So, if you just reserve some space to make a 5-9 combination of level 1 or 2 buildings, the game is pretty easy. I got all achievements in about half an hour, which isn’t that challenging.

It's free, so it’s not a bad shout to see whether the game is for you, but I just think that after this playthrough, I’m not really interested in setting some high score, playing it again or buying the full game.

"""It is what it is"" is the first thought that comes to mind.

In short, no spoilers, you learn this within the first 2-3 minutes and this info sets you up for the rest of the game: your friend sent some peculiar texts that hint that something not very good has happened or is going to happen, and no one knows where she is. Her parents have called the police but otherwise they're not really that bothered and take no responsibility. A friend at school spoke to her just before the disappearance but is reluctant to give you any information other than what you already know. Why would she hide things from [i]me[/i] of all people?
You keep doing the same things over & over in a cursed time-loop. How can you make it stop? How can you find her?

It's a nice enough little narrative adventure. The concept that you re-live the same day over and over can make it a bit repetitive but enough new things happen to not burn you out and it is of course quite short, but it isn't offensively priced.

I really like the art-style and colour-palette, atmospherically it fits really well and the map mechanic and time-loop concept proves that this developer is able to be a bit creative and unique. It's not another identical visual novel narrative made in the same way as all the others.

I wouldn't say the story is amazing but I wouldn't say it is horrid either, I don't know... I found it a bit weak and not as hard-hitting as I wished for & I found the main character to be a little aggressive and irrational, I was not a big fan of that.
Again, [i]it is what it is[/i]: a mediocre little game where a [i]Mixed[/i] rating would be more appropriate than a Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down.
It's this developers first game and it is a fairly strong start for what the game is, [i]practice makes perfect[/i] as they say, and they proved that they are able to do some of their own thing and think outside the box in terms of how the game is paced.

It feels as if people so often expect and demand a life-changing experience from anything they play nowadays when it is a story game, set your exceptions in a more realistic place. And if you're not willing to pay 2$ for an as-advertised short game then don't buy it.
It is pathetic how many people give games negative reviews for literally no other reason than it being short when that is made very clear in all reviews and written very clearly on the store page to indeed be the reality of the situation.

"Interesting concept for an indie game. The combat was straight forward and kind of too simple for me. All around the game seemed a little too easy. In the boss fight I found that at times I could just stand still and not be effected by the bosses attacks. 
Since the game is free, it might be worth checking out but only if your device can handle this game.

Also about the performance,  I have a 3060ti, which isn't the best but it should run a game like this, I looked at the task manager and the game was using 90-100% GPU, The game lags even on the lowest settings with everything off , and on low.

"The course is beautiful and the theme of a super-villain base is well-executed. I like all the individual set pieces like the pool, too. The music is good, though there's this irritating tinnitus-like whine every few seconds that I can't tell if it's coming from the soundtrack or an object in the world; either way, it's a little painful.

Unfortunately, as good of an idea as lasers might have sounded, the gimmick just makes the entire course infuriating from start to finish. Usually each course may have one or two really tough holes, but here I hit the stroke limit on almost every single hole. The 18th in particular I think may just be impossible.

Felt it wasn't fair pinging novice game designers for trying (god only knows my mistakes always got far more attention than my ambition and effort).

This isn't a large game house that should know better or have the resource to do better.

I want to use this space as another petition for Steam to begin a sister site replacing 
Desura / Indievania where these novice titles can be shifted too thereby still encouraging newbies to have a go with Gamemaker while keeping Steam, itself, neatly weeded to make it much easier to browse more professional titles.

Aside from some hideous design choices Darxanadon is a decent recreation of Third-Party games for the NES 8-bit.

Darxandaon's faults are not a product of complacency but rather simply an end result from lack of experience which makes it very hard to review fairly.",0,1

"The game is good and with a small patch it could be a great horror experience. The biggest problem in this game is that there is no voice overs at all (that's ok considiring this was made by 2 or 3 people) and the game relies on subtitles to tell the story. BUT! these subtitles are timed so bad, they dissapear so fast Without enough time giving to the player to understand the story. Please devs fix this issue Asap.

"A slow game with very good background music and effects and has very scenic landscapes.

Did not expect to not see any keyboard controls.
The bugs and the forced camera movement bothered me a bit, 
specially whenever I'd get stuck on invisible barriers or the character froze mid-jump making it fall through walls or the floor.
I got soft locked close to the end because I spawned with the backpack on where there were no places to drop it and no way out since it is impossible to jump while the bag is equipped.

"Quite a refreshing experience on RPG Maker games. Its charm lies in its simplicity, good OST, classic and entertaining gameplay, and the manga-style graphics add a distinctive twist to the game. Bottom line, it's a game well made. Why the thumbs down, then? Because the game's mosaic'd, even with the official patch.

Now the actual review.

It's a Princess Maker clone.  What could be better?  Well, a princess for starters.  Character creation is VERY bare.  No female option, and only 3 face option (and each face corresponds to a unique voice).  To those that don't know Princess Maker, the game-play loop involves choosing daily activities to increase stats.  When you feel your stats are high enough, go out on an expedition (with turn-based battles) and advance the story.  Rise and repeat.

The problem with Various Daylife is that it's extremely slow and ultimately unrewarding.  Your job choices are very limited in the beginning, and at 5 hours in, I've only unlocked a total of 5 classes.  That's also the exact number of potential party members as well, so you're also forced to double up on classes so a diverse party is, as of yet, impossible.  Eventually more will unlock, but it's very slow going and you feel railroaded in what's supposed to be a very free-choice game.  It's like playing Skyrim but being forced to follow the story missions until you reach Whiterun...and it takes you 10 hours to reach Whiterun.

If you know what you're getting into, I'd recommend it at a VERY discounted price.",0,1

"There isn't a lot more to say about the game. It's a visual novel with typical options like text speed and font size. As always, you can skip already read text or everything, which defeats the purpose of the game. The story is what initially draws you to the genre.

In a market saturated with low-effort games, it's difficult to find one that jumps out. Most simply follow the adult and anime trends, add a generic story, and call it a day. I must say that the story in this game lifts it a rank higher. 

The story is delightfully mature and separated into four chapter. Despite some unsettling images, the game is relatively safe for everyone to play. Although each chapter offers two paths you can pursue by making a single decision somewhere in the chapter, there isn't much reason to play the game again. The difference is simply in how you choose to interpret the inexplicable events; you can trust your mind and go down the scientific route, or you can begin to believe in the supernatural.

Unfortunately, the story's poor presentation somewhat detracts from the overall experience. For starters, when you click the mouse button, some paragraphs do not receive a new text bubble. This means the new text appears right below the old content. You don't know where the new paragraph begins because you end up with a wall of text that’s hard to read.

Secondly, the game is not originally in English. As you may expect, this results in some quirky translations that sound awkward or make little sense. There are even some untranslated sentences, however this is a rare occurrence that has little impact on the story's understanding.

Overall, a decent story that’s only the first chapter.",0,1
"Okay since you FREAKS think that all my music sounds like Touhou, I have no choice but to play improvised Touhou music that doesn't actually exist. This is obviously the title screen it's called ""Girl's Pretty Dress Dress, Do your Best Now!"" and uh, basically it just has that Asian scale that's in every title screen um, I made it up in 5 seconds. That's really all I have to say about this one. I'm choosing Lunatic Mode 'cause I'm not a baby. 
   This first level's song is called ""Magical Hop Along Cassidy Station,"" this part of this song is to just remind you that it takes place in Japan in case you forgot. This is where we have the ""sudden transition into the mini-boss battle"" part of the song. You activated my Spell Card, Yugi! Okay I'm flying toward the end of the level now. Picking up some more uh, power ups, I have not reached max power yet because it's the first level. Now it's coming to this sort of break in music while you're talking to the boss. 
   AN APPLE DISASTER!!! That's the name of her song and her name is Apple Girlington. She is the personification of an apple. This spell card is called「The Apple Wizard of Mt. Fuji」it's part of important Japanese folklore. The pre-battle dialogue goes like this: 
   ""You should taste my wonderful apples!""
   ""No, sorry. I'm watching my weight recently.""
   ""No! You have to try the apples or I won't let you through!""
   ""Oh well, I'll give you a diabetes bow tie-""[UNTRANSLATABLE JAPANESE IDIOM]
Then you have a weird chord change because it's a newer Touhou song. Then they make a joke about apple pie.",0,1

"The second DLC ever to come out for any TSW, I do love this one for the nostalgia as well as the nice and easy runs and the variety of gameplay.
Unfortunately, and I do understand that its not possible to go back to every DLC in a major way, this is in desperate need of some love. This route worked quite well for a long time, but since some bugs have been introduced that are possibly game breaking. Also, though there is quite a lot to do, for a 4 track route this feels quite empty. You do see quite a few AI on any run, but most of the time you feel you have all four tracks to yourself. Also, no other stock layers on here, which is sad.
The route and track layout is as great as it always was. Lots of possibilities, a lot of it unrealized.
Scenery-wise, this route still more than holds up and looks great. Though setting it during caternary construction in my eyes was a questionable choice. Wanna do diesel as is, leave it. Would have been better for Diesel Legends, too. Otherwise an electrified version would have been interesting, too. But I do like the HST.
If you are not really out for the HST or GWE, you probably will have a much better time with Southeastern High Speed and/or London Commuter.",1,0

"I've only played part one up to this point.  The game is not as fun as I remember, as a kid playing this.  It is not as much of a challenge either.  It is as buggy as ever and crashes often.  The race/class selection is also more limited than I recalled. The running back and forth all across the same 10 or so screens really limited what the game could have been.

That's the negative.  The story is still fantastic - and simple enough that I remembered everything. The cool things you could do here and there really made this game amazing - like the teleporting obelisks and being able to fight/kill anyone and everyone.  Looking back, this game is probably the game that got me into loving the tactical rpg genre.  A full remake of this game with the ability to utilize the power our computers have now would likely be a best seller. The game had so much potential shoved onto a really low capacity CD.",0,1

"Rangers can instantly place down traps which turns a battle in their favour.
who ever made the pyromancer obviously did it one handed, they have a teleport spell and  have a perk to straight up not die.

One good thing i like is that then the timer runs out, you don't instantly die, and you have an opportunity to find a portal before your health runs out.

Additionally, any shields you consume are added to your health bar which I like and is effected by the storm.
