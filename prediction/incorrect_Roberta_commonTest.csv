Why did i get this game??? ,1,0
It works for the first few minutes but it crashes afterwards. It was a good game. It's a shame that it does that. I wouldn't recommend buying this game at all. It'll be a waste of your time and money.,0,1
Counter-Strike 1.6 is a very old game and i still playing it because it is fun:). ts just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends   It is just a very good game to play with friends:),1,0

If you love a game to play by yourself then go right ahead. If you love to play zombies or co-op campaign then have fun spending countless hours on google searching up a way to fix the sh#tty co-op problems that NEVER go away no matter how hard you try. P.S. Fu#k you treyarch for not helping fix this.,1,0

"I've been playing this game since ijji owned the franchise... 1500 hours, the game itself was fun... until Aeria Games scammed me. After not logging in for 6 months, my account that had a list of guns, was reactivated just to find the entire inventory empty... i made a ticket and thought maybe they're was another process to this... apparently aeria says there is no record of me owning anything of a sort... they left me 30k, and the standard starting m4a1, the standard sv98, and an mp5... Everything i had bought with real money, and everything i took the time to acquired was now lost forever, as staff told me... they even told me my account was banned for 'inactivity' and had 'unused ap'. I will never spend another dollar on this game, and will discourage others from playing this game till the day i die.",0,1

Pros: -RWS retconned the events of this game so really this game is not even part of the actual story line, it was only a terrible nightmare in the mind of The Postal Dude during his radiation coma in Paradise Lost! -It's a great joke   Cons: -It's all toilet humor -Has pointless celebrity cameos -Doesn't feel like a Postal game -It features Uwe Boll -The developers (Akkella) didn't optimize the game at all -It runs on a very broken version of the source engine (Akkella literally broke Source) -Akkella refused to release the source code -Akkella refused to update the game -Akkella refused to release an SDK KIT -RWS had to create a DRM hack to make the game actually launch on newer OS's -It's not worth 20 dollars   FINAL RATING: 0/10 (DO NOT ♥♥♥♥ING BUY THIS)   Here's a link to POSTAL 1 and 2 AND the newest Expansion Pack for Postal 2, go buy these instead.

"Does anyone have suggestions on how I can play Kings Quest 7 on Windows 8? I had success with 1-6, however when clicking 7 it says I cannot play on this PC. I tried installing the most recently suggested patch from below, but that caused all of them to not work until I uninstalled the patch. please HELP! the only one I was most interested in playing was #7 and of course it happens to be the only one that wont seem to work with Windows 8  Edit: I guess I should have read through the reviews in more detail. It is a shame that Steam offers this when it is not compatable with any new computers for KQ7. They should reduce the price and advertise it for KQ 1-6. Anyone know how to request a refund?",1,0

"Yes I am a little behind the times , its a old game . But the people that play this game are the most rude and racisit assbags I have ever met . I play two games on steam so far , killing floor which by far has the most likeable players I have ever met , even made friends with a few but this game , I really regret buying it . Oh it had great graphics , but that is about it . Way to confusing for a first timer plus no way that I found so far to balance the game play . I get tossed into a game with level 70 players I may as well just stay in one spot and be target practice . Maybe MW3 is better but I do not think the price on either of these games just because of the community is worth it . If I want abuse I will go and find a girlfriend into bondage , not some 20 something neckbeard who had played the game forever . Just wish I vould get my money back .",0,1

"I really wish Steam had a 'maybe' recommendation, because this game fits into that. I usually give RPGs about 10 hours to get me hooked, and I gave this one 20 because I heard the story was great and compelling but the story didn't go anywhere during the 20 hours I played. If I hear 'you have to put 40 in to like it' then I say go play an MMO if you're into that.  Overall, the combat is fun. I really liked it, but that might be because you never actually get to use it. You get some new gear and upgrade a few skill points and you're 1-hitting anything your level. Bosses are challenging, until you go into the superpower mode and kill each and every one. Quests aren't very compelling and the talking goes on forever without much reason for me to care about anybody. Not only that but one of the DLC's storylines about giants, which I was interested in, had a glitch that prevented me from finishing it without restarting completely. Awesome.  The graphics are cool and you know what, I wish this game had multiplayer. If it had 2 or even 4 player co-op, it would be awesome. I would have so much fun playing with other people, but the lack of enemies to kill, lack of cares I give, and lack of anything interesting in almost a day playing makes it where I don't feel happy recommending this game.",1,0

"Rather than adopting the typical structured format for my review, I'll instead just explain why I can't recommend this game. First off, this game has consolitis. Hard. Maximum resolution is 1280x800, it can't be run in a window without 'unexpected results,' and it ended up crashing my computer while attempting to play it. Twice. I think I will end up getting it on console, but I just can't recommend it for Steam. Apparently Prototype 2 is a worse port, which completely blows my mind. Anyways, this port just isn't worth it. It's buggy, locked down to hell, and is actually more expensive than just getting it for the 360 or PS3 off of eBay.",0,1

"After taking a break from the game I wanted to pick it up again. Now it seems I can't reconnect to my old profile. Why can't my Steam login function as login for the game? Why does it have to be an external, crappy, complicated login system? I lost my progress and also weapons that I won in the in-game lottery (aka worth real money). Be careful not f*ck up your profile/login.  As for the rest of the game: it's sloppy but fun. Fun enough to keep me going for 100+ hours, admittedly. Yet there's better games to spend your time on, especially if you're playing solo - A.V.A was only fun to me because I played it with 2-3 friends most of the time.",0,1

"One of the most unoptimized PC games ever made. It crashes, it freezes, and it stutters, constantly. Even with user-created .cgf files, Postal III is guaranteed to be a frustrating technical challenge for even the most stacked high-end computer.  The developers went belly up shortly after the game was released, and it's not hard to understand why after playing just a few minutes of this atrocious excuse for code. Even worse, the publisher has disavowed Postal III completely, and they refuse to fix it or improve it in any way, shape, or form.  Not only is Postal III a buggy piece of crap, it fares no better gameplay-wise. Despite being an open-world game, the story forces you down a particular path, and you aren't allowed to free roam until you've completed all the missions. The weapons suck, the graphics suck, the environments suck, the sound effects suck. Absolutely everything about Postal III sucks. You're better off going with Postal 2 -- it's cheaper and it actually runs properly.  Screw the developers and the publisher of this digital abortion. They should have known better.",0,1

"Well, I loved Disciples II. I played the game for countless hours. I loved the artwork, I loved the races, I loved the gameplay. It was a great, darker alternative to that other fantasy strategy/RPG game. There was just something about the game that enthralled me. I really wanted the next installment to be like the second. Unfortunately, it's not.  It looks like the AI is basically set up in such a manner that the higher the difficulty, the more your units just plain suck at combat.  First encounter into the game, my units miss more than they hit. Miss, miss, miss. That's what I saw in the first encounter. And the second. And the third.  The problem is, there's nothing I can do tactically to change this. I can jump on the focus points all I want in combat, but if my units still just whiff every time, I've got no chance. And if the enemy pounced on the focus points before I have a chance to? Well, forget it.  I've played the game for a couple of hours, and already I just plain despise it. I don't mind losing if it's because of the wrong tactical choices I've made, but when I've got no chance as a LVL 1 party because we just miss every time, forget it. I'm done.  I wanted to love this game because I adored the predecessors. This one just makes me never want to play it again.",0,1

"What i like in this game: Gunplay, good gun sounds and they give suitable physical impact, although animations haven't aged well ;) Teamwork/cooperation aspect, not very complicated, no real different player classes, but obviously a sniper won't go to assault tasks with the primary weapon at least Highly customisable, skins, sounds, textures, makes this game fitting for so many different kindsa players with a relatively little effort  Then, things i don't like in this game: Graphics, that's the only thing really, but the good thing is the simple old graphics make everything clear to see and distinguish",1,0

"Yes, the combat is exciting and dynamic. Yes, this game has a huge number of loots... and Yes, this game tons of side quests. Yes, the world is large - OK, the world is gorgeous.  However, despite sinking numerous hours into this game, you'll still find this game somewhat lacking. It has a very uninteresting story. Quests, both main and side, are highly repetitive. I mean, hell - Diablo does have an even more boring story (it doesn't really have one, right?) but I feel a different kind of boredom playing this game - possibly due to the huge world, or samey environment everywhere.  By all means, get this game if you like the flashy combat experience (as said above, it has a decent combat system). But don't expect it to be anything interesting outside of combat. And don't even compare this game to Skyrim, where the world is much more dynamic.",0,1

"This is where Call of Duty began its long decline. Single player (as most of the game in this series) is good and fascinating and multiplayer HAD its good moments (TDM and S&amp;D) but the matchmaking system is really bad. As soon as Black Ops got released this game pretty much died and survives only with hackers dominating servers.

"Probably the ♥♥♥♥♥iest game up to date so far Its not a free to play game. its PAY TO WIN. You literally have to PAY if you want ANYTHING in this game You can't get permanent weapons in this game, everything is paid content ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers, everyone playing with 1000+ ping even if they live next to the servers The ANTICHEAT doesn't even exist in this game lmao, there's hackers everywhere you go! There's no competitive scene in this game, its just complete and utter trash ranned by random monkeys thinking they're good in this game to host something. The GM's are totally stupid and use copy pastes to help people and don't even read support tickets The GS's aren't even helping they just sit on their ♥♥♥ all day locking threads on the forums instead of doing something helpful for this game like running an in game event. Game is not even balanced, free to play players can't even touch a paid user or a high rank player with their weak guns. The game's engine isn't even being updated and everybody are playing in under 60 fps  Every patch the ram usage of this game increases so the 1GB minimum requirement is a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lie it likes more than 1GB and it will probably burn out your computer if you try this horrible game. This game doesn't even get scheduled content patches. its all random, they decide to add 1 or 2 guns to the game which are only available for REAL MONEY every 2-3 months. They get DDoS attacks every weekend most of the time and the servers are down for over 3 days at weekends Community is trash, you will only get flamed in game if you do something wrong. for example failing a 1vs8 clutch in public. this game has the worst ESL events up to date, no cash prizes only 1 weapon for first place rofl which is clearly impossible to top against those TOP players that win cups every time they ban people for no valid reason they banned more than half the game for an invalid reason such as 'spamming' or 'hacking' or even '3rd party selling' when the owner of the account obviously most likely didn't do in the first place.  Aeria Games destroyed every game so far, this is probably the worst game I've ever played. It was better in 2009-2011 when it was running by a proper company called IJJI This company literally ruined it and turned its potential upside down and took it all the way downhill.

"Not a bad game for a genre clone - this wannabe fable wannabe skyrim features gnomes instead of dwarves and Fae instead of elves, but other than that mostly conforms to the tolkien rules. The 'young races,' humans (which are subdivided into skyrim-like factions), are in danger of extinction because of the 'crystal war,' where the Fae 'Tuatha' have declared war because ♥♥♥♥ it, ♥♥♥♥ humans, I guess. The player is in the ever-imaginative position of an amnesiac who somehow has mastery of all weapon types, who wakes up as the Tuatha raid a gnommish outpost and from there I pretty much just stopped paying attention. The story is not very exciting.  The 'Destiny' system, where the player can build themselves between the three fantasy rpg classtypes (if you dont know what those are, this game would not be a great place to enter the fantasy genre), is a great idea, especially if you're a completionist and you want to see what total hybridization has to offer. The way the trees build is a little stupid though - there are like 9 types of weapons and you can put points into one weapon type at a time - if you go for full hybrid, like I did, you pretty much just suck with everything, which is what I expected. The level cap is ♥♥♥♥ing 40, which is GARBAGE - there are about 120 point slots for each classtype, so you can basically unlock a total THIRD of the potential of your game (I used a save editor to give myself more points because it was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). Gold is too readily available and doesn't restrict purchases at all, and the gear tries to be like diablo but it just....isn't. The looting is a little stupid. I'd give this game about a C, it captures attention at first but its flaws just rear up and are impossible to ignore. I loved tossing around chakrams and screw-attacking through people with my warrior-rogue-mage hybrid, but I got so bored I just left-clicked my way through the last third of the game.",1,0

Nope. Bad combat. Bad menus. Bad cameras. Bad storytelling. I've put over 300 hours in the Wticher series and this game broke me after 3.

Counter-Strike is a game that I recommend because: - is one of the legends from the category shooting - is cheaper than the rest from the category shooting - is a method to banish boredom  - is a good method to increase your performance at aim - you can easy change the type of default skins by the skins from internet - have a fair VAC staff - and... why you don't try?

Clan wars are only in EU servers which will MAKE YOU LAG . There's no one in NA playing Clan wars.  HACKERS... A LOT OF CHEATERS with UAV and the best part is they claim they're on their 'alt'.   Overall it's a toxic and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game . Save your blood pressure and play a better game , CSGO is the way to go. My rating : 4.5/10",0,1

"Best hours I spent in my life (arguably &lt;_&lt;), even after so many years I'm still learning... That's ok because that's what make Counter Srike trully special, the learning curve is so steep that you'll never get bored, if you're up for the challenge of course... This game is the true tactical FPS multiplayer, many new games with fancy graphics try to accomplish what CS 1.6 did and fail terribly.  1.6 needs more love from valve, it was one of the games that made steam a 'thing', hell, back in the day it was the ONLY game to bring loyal users to the platform, the games available at the time were very reduced and steam was just an annoyance, to be completely honest we all hated steam, it was a broken nightmare.  Valve could show some love for their baby... adding trading cards, bg's and emo's or even skins would be a great start... one call only dream.. :)  tl;dr: Steam was very broken and the 1.6 playerbase kept it going, valve should recognize that.",1,0

"For me this is the 2nd best Call of Duty game only to Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare. Sadly I do not recommend you purchase this in 2014. Graphically on my Windows 8.1 machine with GTX760 and 16GB memory the game has serious issues with jumping frames and gives the impression you're experiencing severe lag. (Can't find a fix anywhere!)  Moreover, as you'd probably guess with any Call of Duty game, it's been destroyed by kids who think they're hackers. Having some wannabe hacker remove your rank is not un-common. Fair matches are not impossible to find however you never know who is using a mod or what advantage they have given themselves.   Also be warned there are no leaderboards and only a few of the game modes have any activity. Search and Destroy is completely dead.   It's a shame each Call of Duty game is abandoned by the developers so soon after final release, especially considering how much the gaming community has given them.

"I hoe you guys know what you're heading in to get this knife : big troubles. Cons :  Well, you have to plan a full day for it, starting with the downloading time (2 hours), the updating time (30 minutes), the playtime (15 minutes), and the unistalling time (3 hours, because nGameProtect makes your computer laggy as hell, because I think this game was made by Satan himself). You can easily find tutorials on how to completely remove it on Internet, but following the instructions is another story. Not that you're all idiots, just that your computer need 5 minutes to allow you to click on something. Each time. I advise you to create shortcuts where you need to go to unistall it, because once downloaded, you're dead. Or you'll eat your 80th birthday cake in front of your screen.  Pros :  Well, you've just proved you were ready to do anything to have a free TF2 item, so people will respect you for this so long and painful day, or just laugh at you. But in this case, you can still stab them to death with style.  (Do Not) Enjoy !",1,0

If you enjoy stressful online multiplayer games in FPS format then you will like this game.

"'What an excellent and profitable game POSTAL 2 is, I wonder how we can profit from it more.' 'Hey vince, I got an idea.

"Grr.  Ok, functionally this game is excellent. Lots of guns to shoot and lots of things to shoot at. However, the improvements made to these areas come at the price of the story and variety that CoD4 had. The result is a cheesy 'cold war goes hot' story where the Ruskies invade America that is just not very well done (if you want a good story in that setting, go check out the game World in Conflict). And while there is some of the sneaky funtimes of CoD4 that balanced that game against the intense firefights, this game is almost entirely big firefights. Make up a list of every thing you would expect to see in your typical hollywood action movie, and chances are quite alot of what's on that list is somewhere in this game. This is the sequel CoD4 got, but not the one it deserved.  Oh yeah, and multiplayer's here too. I actually did try that out in this game a bit, but after a while I stopped due to a mix of being terrible at its high-pace and annoyance at having few to no chances to try out the Spec Ops co-op missions which were actually kinda cool.  If the only thing that means anything to you is shooting guns in games and explosions, then you can have fun here. But if you like story to go with it, then this game will dissapoint.",1,0

#not impressed. GAME IS NOTHING LIKE FABLE - many people claimed that this was a game very similar to Fable. However they forget to mention its nothing like fable. Fable is a very richly created game with in depth areas to explore. This game however feels like alot less than that. It feels like Fable to some people because it mirrors or copies all of Fable the originals strengths. Yet again it doesnt improve anything. It actually takes away a lot of the fun nods that Fables combat offers. This game is for the faint at heart. Those that want to quickly smash through levels and complete a game. It is not for those that want a rich story with fun combat that never gets old. This combat system is way to simple. Fable series is better off witout any of this dont believe the myths that this game is somehow a lost link to Fable. Decent game but not anywhere near the hype.,0,1

"This game is pretty good. There is a lot to do, you feel like you are sort of making a difference, and the challenges grow with the character. Getting new gear is a treat as they are all visually more and more awesome. However, you need to save often! Not because you might die... lol... oh no... but because you might run into a game bug. So far I've found two and the second one actually disables fast travel entirely. The map in the game is big, but not too big, but the problem is just the annoyance of having to run everywhere. Then I found out when looking for a community to tell me how to get out of the bug, that the game studio apparently imploded. So, now I'm stuck, having to run around everywhere and the game is becoming more of an annoying grind than the fun questing adventure that I've been playing for hours. Big dissappointment and no chance of help. Get the game if you want, but read up on all the quest bugs first. You CAN get stuck. You CAN screw up the whole game. Gamer beware.",1,0

"I wanted very, very badly to like Disciples 3. The art is as stunning as Disciples 2, perhaps even more so. However, the balance is all off - XP gain is not proportional to threats, combat is a slow and frustrating affair (unless you're losing, at which point it will end in two rounds), and even after battles that I've won I had to make a trip back to my capital every single time to resurrect people. And then, if I'm unlucky, sit and mash 'END TURN' until I have the money to afford them.  The fact that I can only claim land in specific points also adds to the tedium, as I have to watch my territory ponderously expand toward resource cites that I've cleared out for dozens of turns before they are claimed.  Of course, the quest dialogue and voice-overs are terrible. Fortunately there's an easy way to turn unit voices off.  There were plenty of improvements between Disciples 2 and Disciples 3, by the way. Combat is now on a tactical grid a la Heroes of Might &amp; Magic. Each grid has randomly-determined sites that can increase the effectiveness of one unit type, and leveraging these effectively can make a moderate battle into an easy one (although they still don't make difficult battles into reasonable threats). Some overworld spells can be cast into runes, which can then be used to cast a scaled-down version of the spell during a battle. Heroes have something not unlike a very toned-down version of the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X, or the leveling system in Final Fantasy 12 - basically a grid in which each square has some sort of bonus, and you can claim any square adjacent to an already-claimed square when leveling up.  But ultimately I'd give this one a skip, even as a fan of the genre.",0,1

"Counter-Strike - a series of computer games in the genre of team first-person shooter based on the engine GoldSource, originally appeared as a modification of Half-Life games.  You have to compare, so this game I will compare with СS: Source and CS: Global Offensive    Pros:    1. Battle PVP.   The multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential of the idea of the game. The most interesting part of this is. Under the bot can already tune in, but not in the real players. They can deceive, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes.   2. The atmosphere and realism.   In all games, Valve is always a great atmosphere and I was impressed. It is evident that the developers have tried to do everything in this game, as in real life. For example, the sounds. Unfortunately, Valve released a patch in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with new sounds and they made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.       Minuses:    1. Cheaters.   Well, as without these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s? These sons of dogs prevent us from playing. Creators of cheats have always been one step ahead of the creators of the VAC anti-cheat. Valve is trying to improve its anti-cheat and have it turns out.I say that Valve do nothing, not worth it.   2.Graphic arts.   She was good at Counter-Strike as long as did not come out Source. I'm not picky about graphics, but after 30 minutes I start to hurt your eyes. Yes, and in general, this game proved to all that the graphics in games are not the most important thing.   3.Termination of support.   All good things always come to an end, and Counter-Strike is not an exception. The game goes more and more players, server empty.More Valve does not release an update for Counter-Strike and does not support it in e-sports.     Conclusion:     Despite the fact that in this game there are downsides, even if they have, but still this game is legendary.  If you ask me, as you Counter-Strike, the fond memories flooding back me, maybe I can cry .Game, which was able to give me a lot of positive emotions..  ",1,0

"Good Premise, mediocre execution. Having not played a point-and-click since Titanic, over 14 years ago, I thought I'd try this as the WW2 spy theme seemed interesting. Sadly, it proved nearly unplayable. Someone experienced with this sort of game may do fine, but I struggled to figure out what I was supposed to do and eventually gave up. You have to do so many boring tasks to get something simple done, as if they tried to prevent the game from being to short, instead of making a better longer game. Example (MINOR SPOILERS): struggle to set up spy camera with correct lens (no instructions given), tripod too low for view out of window (seriously?), go back to office and search for taller tripod, try camera again only to find steam from leaky pipe in nearby building blocking view, find someone to fix pipe...take photo...develop photo (no instructions given), give photos to your boss who does not accept them because you apparently had to take more photos (this was never made clear). The game is full of this, tedious and not enough guidance or help. The voice acting is very mediocre (why get sleepy americans to do german voices?). There were also some problems with screen resolution and loading crashes. All in all a pity, as this game clearly had some potential, with great and historically authentic looking visuals. If you like the subject material and have a lot of experience with these sorts of games, you may like it, otherwise, give this a miss as there are probably much better point-and-click games out there.",0,1

"Over-the-top military action, same basic package as Modern Warfare 1 but with prettier graphics and a bit more controversy. As usual, the TF141 segments are not nearly as fun as the Ranger segments, but they are the ones that play the story forward, unfortunately, whereas the Ranger parts feel more like afterthoughts.  Part of the storyline feels completely ripping off Homefront, story is convoluted and hard to follow and rather short. Barely 5 hours of gameplay. Glad I got it for cheaper.  Not even going to bother with the multiplayer...  If it's 15$ or less, not a bad deal. But more than that? Meh...",0,1

Then you discover to your horror that there's about 100 hours worth of game in here if you're stupid enough to chase down all the sidequests (like me.). This has the honor of being the first open world RPG I played where I started hammering X to skip the dialogue, and I played NWN2 all the way through. None of the characters are interesting or likable, and the bearded elves are intensely boring people. They're also the ones with the most lines.

"This is a pitifully disgusting game now. ruined by hackers and little kids. hell both i should say. shameless lag switchers, aimbotters, wallhackers, hacked servers. Hackers killed this franchise because they have no skills and choose hacks to be better. No hackers you will never be better, if you use hacks you are less of a person and skills will always be better than hacks. and btw, you are not a hacker just because you use hacks, the person who made the hacks is a hacker, you are just subhuman scum in the gutters of forgotten humanity. if i was a zillionaire *even if that was a money amount* id buy this fncking franchise and set it straight, bring back up dedicated servers, update it with the latest hack defenses, idk theres sh!t out there. if it wasnt for hackers and little kids this would still be The Number One FPS shooter of all time. yes. im not exaggerating. But it is nice to find that one rare match where no one is actually hacking and its a non hacked lobby and acceptable connection, thats when the beauty of the game truly shines through. i dont recommend you buy this game, but you can if you want. i just bought it for old times sake because i had it on PS3.",0,1

"Competent, yet completely average and uninspired shooter. Ultimately, Timeshift feels just gimmicky - and it exhausts it's bag of tricks very fast. I had fun shooting an explosive bolt into a guy's head with time frozen and watching him suddenly become inert gibs. A couple of the weapon are very interesting, regardless - a submachine gun with incendiary rounds and attached flamethrower was different enough to become a favorite -, but their designs are, again, uninspired (What the hell is that assault rifle?!), and the audio and feedback lacks any punch (though the shotgun WILL send people flying... after maybe two or three shots at close range.) The game quickly devolved into slow-motion dashing through cover while waiting for the limited time-resource to recharge. In the end, Timeshift didn't offer enough freedom to abuse my timepowers nor enough challenge or solid gameplay to constitute a good shooter - in this regard, it didn't achieve either a sandbox I could blow steam off in nor a challenging game I could be engaged in. Instead, it forced me to play it like a shooter with a fun-but-repetitive gimmick I could enjoy every forty seconds - and it doesn't have enough foundation as a shooter to force me into that. F.E.A.R. provides a far more enjoyable experience - in which the time effect, while not as varied - supports a much better game - and one that stands on its own without the gimmick.",0,1

"Life is one .. CS is 1.6 only . I will not say it is the most fav game of mine . But it doesn't strive to be the most fav game of anyone . My fav game has to be GTA ! The thing why we all love this game and we all feel the urge to say this is the most fav game is that once this game starts , the human element takes over and we actually game with our friends ( and strangers) and that's what gives us the enjoyment; the feel of competitiveness and who is the best ; to be in awe of some good player and the list goes on . The game itself is not great but the way in which it just lets the human element takes over and be the silent spectator as we enjoy and have a good time , just speaks volumes of the greatness of this game ! The game is like a silent Guardian which governs us as we enjoy our life in the 1.6 way ! GG",1,0

"Counter-Strike (officially abbreviated as CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in which teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists battle to, respectively, perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking) and prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first version of Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification for Half-Life and designed by Minh 'Gooseman' Le and Jess 'Cliffe' Cliffe, before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.  The game was followed-up with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. Later that same year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released only eight months after Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, in November 2004, the game was a remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine.[1] The fourth game in the main series to have been developed by Valve, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who also worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.[2] Several spin-off titles have been released for Asian territories.",1,0
"This game is the dictionary definition of mediocre. While there is nothing blantantly wrong with it, it does not excel in any department either. Being able to control time at will sounds like a great mechanic but it is poorly implemented in this game. During combat all you need to do is slow down time and you become virtually untouchable. which takes away any sort of tension during firefights. It seems the develepers tried to account for this by making enemy fire highly lethal (meaning a couple of shots to the face and you're dead), and by having enemies ambush you -- as if they come out of nowhere -- resulting in constant reloadings back to the previous checkpoint. Even having purchased this game on sale I cannot recommended it since, despite giving it an honest try, it offers no entertainment value. ",0,1

"Whilst this game had some fun moments I can't really recommend it unless you manage to get it on sale, like I did (3,75 euro).  Basically, Timeshift is a mixture of F.E.A.R. and Half-Life, yet completely lacking in atmosphere and devoid of any interesting characters.  The 'story', for want of a better word, is pathetic, and turns out to be merely a weak pretext for moving you along from one set of stuff that you have to blow the s##t out of to another.  The widely dispersed 10 second long cut scenes containg anonymous characters that you don't give a fù@k about are laughably bad.  Some of the puzzles would be fun ... if you didn't have to die 10 times in order to solve them, which for me is a total immersion breaker ... although perhaps the word 'immersion' is paying to high a compliment to this drivel.  Summary: Not worth it unless you're in desperate need of some mental chewing gum to get you through a rainy day.",0,1
"I honestly believe Radical Entertainment though up this game, went around to other developer studios learning what they did wrong and right in games in the past, took the 'right' pile, tossed it in the toilet and flushed it down, and started building the 'wrong' pile into some unholy altar.  Seriously. EVERY... SINGLE... THING... in this game is a TEXTBOOK example of 'what NOT to do in video games' that you'd get in a 101 class.  Terrible controls. Terrible plot. Terrible music- maybe. Sound was INSANELY LOW compared to everything else on my computer- even when maxed. I literally had to TRIPLE the volume of my speakers to be able to hear it at a decent level. Terrible graphics. Terrible controls. Oh wait- I said that already. Well it's important to re-emphasize because the controls and mechanics made the game BORDERLINE unplayable. And I use that world with the utmost intention. If it had a SINGLE thing worse with it's controls- it would have been straight up unplayable. The game until a certain point was so easy it was impossible to enjoy. Then after that point they cranked the meter up to 11 to the point it was entirely unfair. Permanent stunlocks. ONE HIT KOs that you CANNOT avoid.  NEVER. EVER. EEEEEVER... buy this game. EVER.  I got this game at 75% off on a sale. I feel like walking up to the developers studio and demanding that 25% I paid back as a refund, then the 75% I didn't added on to compensate for my pain and suffering. This game was THAT bad. I've only ever quit one other game in my entire LIFE- witcher 2. And that was because it was LITERALLY unplayable due to issues with the port to PC. At least I knew within the first 3 minutes of witcher 2 that it was going to be nothing but pain and suffering and I didn't actually suffer through the ENTIRE thing.  I played through the game start to finish (as quickly as humanly possible...) so no one can say I didn't give it a chance. It had it's chance 100 times over as far as I'm concerned. I am unfortunate enough to have bought prototype 2 at the same time as part of the franchise pack when the game was on sale. Needless to say- I will not be installing that any time soon.",0,1

"Absolute. Waste. Of. Time. This game was gifted to me, so I went ahead and gave it a go. The graphics aren't too bad -- if you don't mind laziness. Objects were recycled from scene to scene, and sometimes not even altered or rotated. The script is also terribly rigid. Your cursor will show you various places you can click to go -- but you HAVE to follow the script and can only make one -right- choice every time. That aside, the worst part of the game is the dialogue. I don't know if they had a deadline to meet or what, but the voice actors sound like they're reading the script cold and have no idea how to inflect any sort of emotion into what they're saying. It's torture to listen to. For that reason, it's likely I may never finish this game. /Anti-Recommendation",0,1

"Don't buy it for it's time-manipulation bs - the meter that it lets you control time with is so small a frame that you basically need accelerated senses anyway to slow down time...If your expecting a modern take on Prince of Persia - you DON'T want this.  Also the AI feels a bit scripted instead of natural - case in point: you try to destroy this big yellow mech with allies, the mech heals when you don't shoot it and the allies backing you continuely return to fire and make the same death scene whether you reverse time or not. Basically unless you can 1hit it with inferior weapons and/or make use of the limited time-manipulation reserves you have (something I wasn't able to do) you can't destroy it - however by backing up for cover you also reset the scene so you have to do all this without running back for shelter from it's rockets.

I know, the points I'll criticize are very subjective, but that's the thing with critics, so no offense to the ones who love this game, it just doesn't seem to be my style. ;)  Story/Quests:  Ähem. First a confession: I didn't finish it. Yeah. Sorry. It was just not interesting enough. There are epic bossfights, a very, very evil overlord, a war and you as - of course - the chosen one. At least everything you need for a high-fantasy RPG. NPC's are exchangeable all over the place, I cannot even remember a single name. Much less their background.  The main Quests are okay, the 'guild'-Quests also, the rest is too often just filler (Kill X to get Y and bring it to Z), nothing memorable.  World/Graphic: It's colorful. Very colorful. So colorful that I cannot take this game as serious as it wants to be. All this quirky, comic-like fairy-stuff... I mean, even the supposed 'Dark' areas are kinda sweet!  The Graphics themselves are okay, not state of the art, but it's a game from 2012, so - oh, wait... 2012? ... Yeah, they could have done it better then. But it's still not 'bad', just 'okay'.  The map is gigantic and you are free to walk where you want. Unless you walk against a rock. Or against any other obstacle on your path. Even if it's just waist-high. And that upsets me every time in every game! But the music is lovely!   Fighting/Level System: The Action is nice, there are a lot of cool moves you can do, some really powerful spells and techniques. All combined, it makes quite fun to slay all that monsters. And if you are as bored as me by the story (but still not bored enough to quit yet), you might also regard the looting and levelling as your last source of long-term motivation. Also the game has a cool crafting-system, it's diversive and sometimes useful at the same time!  RPG really is my genre of choice, but it seems that I'm not a colorful, very-high-fantasy kind of player... I really gave it many chances to thrill me, but the atmosphere, the story, the character - all that failed to thrill me.",0,1

"Ready for a mystery game? Then grab scooby doo jump in the mystery and drive it off a cliff, just end it all now if you plan on finishing this game.  The voice acting sounds literally like their reading off a page, no matter what the characters are doing, walking, or running, in danger, their voice stays the same flat or unconcerned. Get ready for ALOT of bad voice acting since this game is story driven. The main character sounds angry at everything when he talks, just looking at in game items makes him mad. I am guessing he is mad for being in one of the worst games ever made. I got five minutes into the game and got stuck, unable to continue, with no hint system or anything I turned it off and deleted it.  Every single time you move to another screen the game loads like an old Resident evil game, except in this game its not passing through a door, just walking to the other side of a room makes the game load.

Get Wolfenstein 3D, they have about the same depth, or Metro if you're looking for a game with good combat and great singleplayer, or Red Orchestra 2 if you're looking for a WW2 style single player (but it's really not that good).

"About Counter-Strike Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.  Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.  Gameplay Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.  Counter-Strike is a good game. I recommend this game.  Thanks Valve Thanks !!! Old but Gold !!!  10/10 From Me Sweep Playing this game since 2004",1,0

"You can buy this game collection to own the games legally and most of them are quite good, in part hilarious. Unfortunately in doing so you pay for software that simply doesn't work without you updating and configuring DosBOX. The website 'Sierrahelp' holds some patches you may want to install which aren't installed in the Steam version of 2016 even though they were released years ago; they also help with proper DosBOX setup, however you still may want to manually tweak the configuration files. Beware, parts 2 and 3 from this collection are not available in VGA and require keyboard controlling instead of mouse support which is a bit too 'classic' for my taste. However, there is a fan-made VGA version of Space Quest 2 that is really well made and even has acceptable voice acting! To beat Space Quest 6 without an online walkthrough you require some extra manual (used as a form of copy protection) that was forgotten to include in this collection! So, have fun spoiling parts of the game with a walkthrough!  All things considered the games are funny and worth playing even decades after their inception, but this collection is so badly executed it means you buy tedious work.",0,1
"After I bought Postal 2, i saw that there was a third one and it had modern-day graphics and i thought that was pretty cool and then I saw all the negative reviews except for the literally only postive review and i thought to myself, hmmm I wonder how bad this game is? Seeing as how the second one was badass and amazingly better than some of the AAA games we get served today, so i bought it, played it and beat it, and now i now why this game is slandered, even RWS has given up on this trainwreck but before i trash this game more i have to say there are parts of this game that are good but far from being awesome.  Like my review of Postal 2, this review will broken down in the same areas  Gameplay, Graphics, Sound and most importantly Story  Warning: this is my opinon and if anything offends you, i deeply apolgize  Gameplay 5/10: the overall gmeplay isn't all to bad, the controls aren't bad but they are a big difference from its predecessor, the main control feature i like about this game is you don't have to use the mouse scroll for changing your guns, you can now use X and C for that which for me (being a console gamer for 16 years) is a big up for me since i'm still new to the PC controls. The game praises it's so called 'advanced AI' but in reality the so-called 'advanced AI' isn't so advanced unless advanced AI means running in your line of fire and killing all the 'advanced AI' in like two seconds  Graphics 6/10: the graphics of this game are not that bad but also not that good for a game that was realeased in 2011. there are times where the graphics acutally look complete and then other times your face palming with more regert than Patrick Stewert.  Sound 8/10: this is the only department that this game did good in. The BGM of this game is amazing, the only time the BGM is bad, is that it is stuck in a never-ending loop, so in the longer levels in the game it starts to become a ear ache. The sound F/X of this game is why the sound gets an 8 out of 10 instead of being a perfect score, the gun noises in this aren't as realistic as they were Postal 2, but they aren't horrible either, at least they are actually sounds instead of one guy making 'pew-pew' noises.  Story 6/10: the only reason this game's story did better than Postal 2 is because it's more of a linear based game, so there is more room for story, but the main reason ot only did a point better was becasue it's story was all over the f***ing place, when i finally beat the game, i had no f***ing idea what the f*** happend, the story has more holes in it than swiss cheese or a Micheal Bay movie (uggh don't get me started on him)  Overall 4.5/10: Overall this game needs A LOT more work and if it was developed on for a little bit longer (i'd say like two more years) it may have been a better game but I personally think that it should have been the exact same game as the second but with a new story and graphics like Halo 3. (ahhh if only) But before i go, the nic people over at Anthology Production, are making a mod for Postal 2, and it's basically taking Postal 3 and putting it into the engine of the second game and more! So i cannot wait for it to come out. so as you can see I do NOT reccomend this game but if you really want to play this s***ty game than wait for that mod.",1,0

"Although I've played through pretty well the whole game (minus a little bit of DLC) I can't recommend this game.   While others say that all the side quests are great and add value to the game, all they were for me was make busy time to make the game feel long. For example, towards the middle/end of the game there is a gnome city where to get the side quest you go to the very back corner of a house and then to finish the fetch quest you have to go the very back of another house and then of course go back to the quest giver to finish the quest. There doesn't appear to be any sort of design choice for that other than making the quest take longer. The amount of side quests also showed just how forgetable the main story quest was. I don't recall much if any of the main quest because there would sometimes be hours and hours between times you did something related to the main story quest.  As 'big' as this game is. It feels empty. Almost every area you go to is super similar. You go to a new area, there will be one town or a larger city to get quests from, then there is a bunch of caves/tombs/ruins to fulfil those quests. A lot of those caves/tombs/ruins all feel the same because you do the same thing in each. You enter the side quest area at one end, go to the end of the area, finish your quest and then a new path opens up to send you back to the beginning. As well each of these areas feel like copies of each other with different colour pallets. Half of these areas could have been removed and more time/focus spent on bigger and better side quests that actually felt rewarding.  As well there is a serious problem with enemies in this game, as in, there is not near enough of them. There appears to be a set of them and then a bunch of recolours or with a different weapon or something. There was hardly an variety in the enemies making each area again feel like copies of previous areas.  The one positive I'm going to give this game is the amount of lore they've packed into it. If you complete all the side quests/faction quests and main quest you will have a lore overload and if thas your thing this game has it.",0,1

"Postal 2 won't go down in history as one of the greatest games of all time. It probably won't even make the average top 500 list. That said, I thought it was very entertaining. When it comes to Postal III, I'm at a loss for words. I'd prefer to write a positive review, describing in detail on how this game improved on its predecessor. If necessary, I could write a negative review, filled to the brim with reasons as to why I believe this product to be a disappointing sequel. Instead, I'm staring into the abyss.  The Postal Dude is at it again. After blazing a trail of death and destruction through the town of Paradise, he finds himself in Catharsis. Madcap mayhem and wacky hijinks await as Postal Dude tries to find a paying job. Will you somehow find the light of virtue within yourself? Or will you once again submit to your demons, using murder to solve every minor dilemna? Whatever the case, you're sure to be in for a great time. This game also stars Ron Jeremy and Jennifer Walcott. I'm surprised that Lloyd Kaufman didn't make an appearance as well.  This entry uses a morality system. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean The Postal Dude will be helping old ladies cross the street (or into woodchippers). Basically, if you want to be the good guy, you have to abide by the law. Naturally, this requires that you become a police officer, and make the law your own. While this doesn't give you a free pass to endanger innocent lives, at least you're doing your part to make Catharsis a safer(?) place. If that sounds like too much trouble, you can always be evil incarnate. This will result in different levels, and eventually a bad ending, if you don't change your ways. If eternal damnation doesn't appeal to you, there's always the handy taser gun. Non-lethal takedowns slowly add up, allowing you another opportunity to join the force when you complete the level. Unfortunately, the possibility exists that your morality, will be at the mercy of the game itself.  While I applaud the writers for their attempt at injecting more story into the Postal saga, things stop making sense very early on. I suppose this can be attributed to the fact that I had to skip stages in order to progress. Let me rephrase that: I had to cheat* just to complete this game. Aside from the high probability of crashes, there are numerous scripting issues. Some doors are scripted to open when an event occurs. For reasons that can surely be attributed to the troubled development of the game, these scripts frequently break.   To give an example: Shortly after I joined the force, I was tasked with eliminating the homeless that were running rampant through the police station. Eventually I reached a point where a door was supposed to open, but it didn't. I could see the enemy's guns clipping through the door, but there was nothing I could do about it. I restarted the level, which fixed it. However, there was another door later on in the level, and it had the exact same issue. This happened again in another level, where I was supposed to go to the mall, the doors simply wouldn't open.   Unlocking all of the stages in Postal III via cheats is a simple task, but that isn't the point. All that work I did trying to be a good Postal Dude? Gone. Putting difficulty aside, when a game can't be completed without resorting to cheats, that means it is broken.  Postal III tends to feel like busy-work. Most of the levels start off with an extremely boring job, which fits in with the story. After a short time, things get crazy when Soccer Moms or Savage Nerds or Eco-Terrorists or ???? show up. This is the point where you have to kill/subdue a certain number of them so that the level will end. Postal 2's strength wasn't in standard FPS mechanics. A lot of the entertainment came from using the sandbox aspects. It was a game designed around finding different solutions for everyday problems (sometimes without murder). With Postal III, almost the entirety of the product involves shooting, and it is very poorly-handled. The Postal Dude can take cover, but it's so ineffective you're sometimes better off standing out in the open. On the bright side, the enemy AI is so bad they're liable to ignore or even forget about you in the heat of combat. The levels that don't require the player to deal with x amount of enemies, tend to be really linear slogs. There are even escort missions, as if players wouldn't have enough reasons to hate this game.   Aside from severe technical faults such as long load times and poor performance, Postal III also suffers from awful mechanics. Melee is basically useless. Even the heavier weapons, like the fire ax, don't work all that well. One of the items you acquire is a laser pointer, for leading Champ (your dog) to enemies. It is complete trash. The same can be said about most of Postal III's weapons. There's no real incentive to play with them, because they either don't work, or just aren't satisfying. Typically, the average Postal III play-through is going to revolve entirely around shooting everything. It gets old very quickly. Urinating is no longer infinite either. The Postal Dude can't ♥♥♥♥ as much as he wants, now he has to wait for his bladder to refill. Yes, it's probably an unnecessary thing to complain about, but it's still a nonsensical change that adds nothing to the game. Everything about Postal III is worse than its prequel...Everything**.  Some of you reading this review might not care about Postal. You might even think 'It's a garbage franchise anyway. Who cares?' Well, it's just my opinion, but I liked the second game. It was crass, offensive, and sometimes the humor fell absolutely flat. Yet underneath all of the nastiness, there is still a game. Postal III is broken, and is more prone to cause headaches than provide any entertainment value. The multitude of bugs, scripting failures, and generally unfun game-design, make for a forgettable entry in this controversial series.  *While I did cheat to complete a couple stages, I didn't actually try to skip any.  **The soundtrack is pretty decent.

"So I was playing with my friends, and I knew one of my friends were cheating. But I didn't care about what he did and I just wanted to play because it was fun. So after some days he got VAC banned and we laughed at him. And the day after, I got VAC banned too...I have no idea why I got banned. Was it because I played with my friend that cheater or? The only thing I have to say now is ♥♥♥♥ OFF MW2",0,1
"This game is terrible. The combat is sorely unbalanced, its the same hack and slash on repetitive enemies over and over and over again. There are three types of dungeons and they reuse and recycle. Its the same visual effects through the entire game. When they tell you theyve added 3 hours of content it means theyve added 6 Rocks Trolls each which takes 30 minutes to hack and slash to death. Its constant mouse and keyboard mashing doing the same move over and over again until the single target you are slashing on is dead. The majority of the moves and abilities are useless, the stealth system sucks, and walking through an area will pull every mob in the entire zone. 2/3rds of the way through the game I had 3M gold saved up with nothing to spend it on. The DLC is glitchy and the voice acting sucks. I understand why they didnt make a sequal, and the company who made the game went completely out of business. DONT BUY THIS GAME! HUGE WASTE OF MONEY when you can play Morrowind, Oblivion, any of the Dragon Ages, Skyrim, or any of the Witcher series.   The ONLY saving grace is that the weapons look cool until you hit the Prismere items later in the game. Then it looks like someone stole granny's red rock collection and forged it into armor.

"'A call button... purple maybe....'  OPTION A: *PRESS IT?* OPTION B: *DON'T PRESS IT?*  *SELECTED: OPTION A*  '...PRESS it...!' *Presses button.  And then... well... yes.

Load times are irritatingly long, animations are broken, and it's just not something you'd expect after the better half of a decade of waiting.  If you catch it under $4.99, go for it; it's worth five dollars of fun. Otherwise, keep looking.",0,1
"I suppose it is an okay game but..  Fun? Yes it actually is and not too difficult either and kind of refreshing.  No saves? I do not have a lot of time to play and there´s where the lack of a save option stops me from playing further.   Gaming gear used: There was also a problem with my logitech rumblepad, I had to disconnect it to get the game working properly. I had it plugged in for another game but obviously this game does not like that. I used my mouse and keyboard for this game.  Recommend: No. If it only had an autosave/save function then I´d would have voted positive surely.",0,1

"Although this game was made 100 years ago, it still retains its core value being a great FPS shooter that requires team work and not just 360 no scoping. This game wouldn't mean anything to a 13 year old because the graphics aren't great but to a person my age this game holds many hours in my heart. 8.5/10",1,0
"This game was unfortunately the downfall of CoD. While it fixed many previous inbalances from the first modern warfare, it introduced many new overpowered abilities such as the commando perk and dual wielding shotguns. Not to mention how crazy devs went with killstreaks and even included the game ending tactical nuke. The game is still a bit of fun as it has very satisfying gunplay and can be very intense, but good luck playing some of the more tactical game modes that require teamwork over deathmatch. It also is very easy to get cheap kills that take no skill or for someone to cheaply kill you without really using any skill. The skill cap in general is very low as well seeing as it pretty much an arena shooter with slower and simpler movent, iron sights, and regenerating health.   On top of all of this, this game is a very bad pc port. It lacks basic features that previous pc CoD titles had such as dedicated servers that support up to 64 players. You can also apparently get vac banned for adding a fov slider, a feature that should have already been in the game in the first place  5/10",0,1

"I realize that I played through this entire game and its DLCs and even went so far as to get 100% of the achievements, but I just cannot recommend it. It's not all negative, it's just... boring.   And it shouldn't be. The environments should be mind blowing. The character design should be good. The weapons and armor designs should be interesting. But, they just... aren't. They are by themselves out of context. The screenshots and such for this game make it look really interesting and captivating. But when you are playing, everything is really bland text-book fantasy cliche and so all these things that look really nice out of context become dull and boring when put together as a whole in the context of the game.   Also, the crafting system sucks and doesn't seem to make any weapons or armor better than what you can find in the game. Also, the random loot system sucks: you find a piece of a named armor set, but by the time you randomly get all of the pieces or even enough for it's cumulative effects to be useful, you've leveled up way beyond it and have found generic armor beyond its capabilities. And, I'm not sure if it is possible to make sidequests any more generic, boring, and repetitive.   The gameplay itself and combat are fine, I guess.   So, bad crafting, bad loot, extremely meh gameplay, nothing special combat, and incredibly dull cliche story and characters make this game just plain boring. If you are looking for a fantasy world to explore, you'd be much better of going and wandering around Skyrim again.",0,1

"This isn't a bad game, its just not worth your time.  The best way to describe it is like an awsome MMO from the mid 2000's with nobody on the servers.  The main story is good, but there are SO MANY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t fetch quests that just eat up time and you have to do some of them to be an appropriate level to beat the game. There almost all terrible.  The ONLY way I could reccomend this game is if you are an unemployed gamer (no judgment) and want a large amount of time for you buck and don't mind sacrificing gameplay.  If you have a good internet connection I reccomend any good MMO over this game. It will scratch the same itch but better.",0,1

"So, i tried playing this game on my Windows 7 PC. It is pretty much as good as those with Windows 7 go, but the game is stuck on constant 5 fps, making it barely playable. Apparently it is connected to HID, which would be fine. IF this was the year 2009. Seven years later, this gamebreaking error is not fixed, and has to be manually looked up and dealt with by players who want to play this. To people who want to play a singleplayer game for once because their internet is too ♥♥♥♥ to play online, this is just infuriating. So basically, i bet i would like this game, if i could play it.

"Abominably bad, one of my biggest gaming disppointments. Do not buy.  EDIT: Finally struggled through to the endgame. A few thoughts:   - Story blatantly rips off Half Life 2, while somehow missing the pacing and depth that were the worthy parts to steal.  - Gameplay can flow nicely, but quickly becomes repetitive.  - Terrible level design.  - Graphics make Deus Ex's look modern.  - Pathetic AI.  - All the characters are 1-dimensional.  There is no challenge in this game. The time control mechanics make regular combat insultingly easy, even against the enhanced enemies. By the end I was just breezing through the fights. Ideally the story would have compensated for the boredom, but no luck there. The endgame was a cutscene, no payoff, no interaction. Just headshot, ♥♥♥♥ity bye. Overall, a wasted opportunity.",0,1

Tenno Heika Banzaiiii  Neutral: = Call of Duty = Generic FPS, altough fun in times = Voice acting is meh  Cons: - Call of Duty - Repetetive gameplay, hardly entertaining - Tiring like war.

Combat is not revolutionary or more interesting than any other RPG - In fact it's much more linear. Combat is not better just because I can spam buttons and things will happen. You don't even have to aim the bow ffs. The melee attacks are 'aimed' using vague directions of which way to swing.   The interface is clunky and irritating to deal with. The button mappings are restrictive and unintuitive.   The fact that this game used to be $50 astounds me considering the low quality of development - I paid $10 for it on a Steam sale and I feel that was too much.,0,1

"Runespell Overture is a card game with kind of original mechanic, blending the combinations from poker with tactical moves from Arcomage - where you collecting some points to use them on some spell, which will either attack your opponent or defend yourself better.  Point one is that it is NOT a Role-Play Game, it is only a card game with 'health points' on you and your enemies, and some grades of combinations to win the hand. Point two is that Arcomage - and many games alike - are still Much Better by the terms of gameplay.  As a Pro point, I like the visual stylistics of the Runespell, the way it's presenting itself - it has a good facade, so to say. Game mechanic and scenario combined creating good impression, which follows you in first third, maybe first half of the whole game. But then... then you notice, that the challenge is not anything intense, and just proceeding using quite the same basic combinations - basically doing all the same over and over... and at that point, you'll be not so happy.  The story is okay for that type of game... but nothing fancy or really rewarding for your struggle to beat dozens of almost similar enemies - and even bosses are not much different! To finish the impression, Runespell: Overture is maybe short (about 5-10 hours of gameplay), but holds one bugged achievement, which I can't complete even after 30+ hours... do I need to tell you how I love such things?  Oh, well, I'll just mark it with 5.5/10, and leave it be. Do not recommend, as there are enough of better card games, even in the F2P ghetto.",1,0
"In the days of my youth I was told what it means to be the game And now I've reached that age I try to do all those things without a shame No matter how I try I find my way to the same old jam  Good times, bad times You know there was a game When a woman left home for a brown-eyed man But I still play and not seem to care  Sixteen, I fell in love with a game as sweet as could be It only took a couple of years till I was rid of it I swore that I won't play again and I did not come back But when that CS:GO came out I knew it will be sad  Good times, bad imes You know graphs' not at 1st place When a 'smurf' plays against silver ranked men Bring me back to those happy days  Hitbox was good and people were kind now it's not the same Those amazing rounds deep on my mind and all the pros into hall of fame If you talk about cybersport so that game was of that type Now just money flows like a river and everyone's getting hyped  Good times, bad times You know what do I mean When people were saying - go 1 on 1?

"Lackluster. They borked their camera and prevent you from seeing a lot of the hard work they put into the visual design.   The story is freaking hoaky. Nothing interesting. The whole fate thing has been done to death by the Japanese, come on man.  The gameplay is a mixed bag, the quests suck. They're MMO quests in a single player RPG, not cool. The combat how ever is alright, though given how big the environments are they could have gone a lot more nuts with it, buy what ever. Combat gets an A.  I can't recommend this game for anything other than a quick sale buy. I really hope someone takes the ideas from it and makes something presentable.",0,1

"This is a pitifully disgusting game now. ruined by hackers and little kids. hell both i should say. shameless lag switchers, aimbotters, wallhackers, hacked servers. Hackers killed this franchise because they have no skills and choose hacks to be better. No hackers you will never be better, if you use hacks you are less of a person and skills will always be better than hacks. and btw, you are not a hacker just because you use hacks, the person who made the hacks is a hacker, you are just subhuman scum in the gutters of forgotten humanity. if i was a zillionaire *even if that was a money amount* id buy this fncking franchise and set it straight, bring back up dedicated servers, update it with the latest hack defenses, idk theres sh!t out there. if it wasnt for hackers and little kids this would still be The Number One FPS shooter of all time. yes. im not exaggerating. But it is nice to find that one rare match where no one is actually hacking and its a non hacked lobby and acceptable connection, thats when the beauty of the game truly shines through. i dont recommend you buy this game, but you can if you want. i just bought it for old times sake because i had it on PS3.",0,1

"1 of the worst game that i have ever seen. So boring, primitive, unlogical. I am talking not only about mw2, but about all game series from CoD4 to ghosts. For example, weapons. It seems that weapons' characteristics were written under tonns of drugs. .50 cal barret has similar damage to 7.62x51 M21 rifle. USP .45 has same damage to 9mm beretta ( 9x19 vs 11.43x25 ). Tavor-21 ( 5.56x45 ), AK ( 7.62x39 ) and SCAR-h (7.62x51) have SAME damage. .50 AE desert eagle has same damage to .44 revolver. WHY every CoD has WA2000 rifle??? only 200 rifles were made and nobody use it. HEY TREYARC! just google ' sniper rifle ' - you will find a lot of sniper rifles which is much better than experimental WA2000. About scenarious - yeah, bad russians and good americans save the world - very fashionable story. Nothing original, nothing interesting - just always make the same. About BO - this is the worst CoD even made. Its just epic fail. 90% of all weapons are FROM FUTURE. Game about 1960's and it has AK74, WA2000 from 1980's (!!!), GP25 and a lot of other things. Of course scenarios are the worst - tell how bad russians used nazi scientists and put heroes of ww2 into the prison. And it doesnt matter that IRL situation was clearly the opposite - americans used nazi scientists. Gameplay is the most primitive, unlogical, unrealistic and boring. All gameplay in 2 words - run n gun. Even Counter-strike is more logical, realistic and interesting than this. Freaking health regeneration - after .50 in stomach just wait several seconds and you are OK.  http://huh.by/uploads/posts/2012-06/1340985650_call-of-duty-vkratce.gif  - about melee fight. And about Ghosts.. dear treyarc, what do you call ' nextgen '? I have never seen so bad graphics, even RO1 and CS:S have better graphics than 'ghosts'. Gameplay is just 100% copypast from other CoDs, this game is still the same as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago, IT IS ABSOLUTELY 100% SAME GAMEPLAY - NOTHING CHANGED.   I think that treyarc just uses the brand, sucks money from blind people. I really wonder that someone still plays it and love it.  The only 1 CoD which i like - is the first CoD. This is the only 1 CoD where you dont have health regen, here you have 100 hp. Yea, its quite unrealistic too, but it is more realistic than auto regen after any wound. Only in first CoD you can place your weapon bi pod. Only in first CoD you can use vehicle NORMALLY, WITHOUT ANY STUPID LAPTOPS.",0,1

"Despite my hilariously low count of, 0.6 hours, on record, I can attest to you that, nay, I have played this game(and it's 'sequels') to the ends of time. I've literally sunk close to 15,000 hours into the various derivations of CS over the years.  I found out about CS from some #IRC chat I used to frequent back in the day(it might have been an ICQ chat with one of them). Namely, I started with the first ALPHA(yea, not beta, ALPHA). I can recall the loading screen and everything. From there, I progressed through the initial betas, introduction of maps, and various weapons(anyone remember the OLD cs_siege, complete with working apc and sniper tower?), etc.  I then became a player in various 'leagues'; I won't name drop, but I was a baller at one time.  So, yes, this game is good. Some people recommend CSGO as the 'modern' return of 1.6, but I disagree. CSGO is better than CSS, yes, but still not on-par with 1.6, nothing will ever be :(  Goodbye WON-servers.",1,0

"Would be a decent game if the bosses weren't ridiculously overpowered, the game has many bugs one being that it crashes A LOT. Meaning you have to restart A LOT of missions because you can't save during them.  I appreciate it's an old game but come on, it can't be this bloody awful.",0,1
"Amalur would have been a great...well, at least good, 20-30 hour game. Unfortunately it goes on far, far, far longer than it should have The mechanics are already well worn by hour 15 and did little to change over the next 40. This wouldn't be too bad if the game wasn't excessively repetitive, even by RPG standards. You spend the bulk of this time mashing buttons to kill groups of 4-8 enemies over and over - never with any sense of real power or progression due to enemies leveling with you. Quests become a homogenous blur of cave delving and monster killing and about 2/3 of the way through the game I began to resent it and just rushed through to see the ending. I wish I had made the decision to do that even sooner.  It's a shame because it seems like the world has actually has a reasonably novel backstory. It relies on typical fantasy tropes, but not quite to the extent of other RPGs. The story also opens an interesting manner; however, even this falls short of it's potential, with a stodgy presentation that lacks personality and the game's overabundance of sidequests, fights, and travel diluting whatever motivating force the story could impart. At some point you stop caring and stop listening and characters are just a means to check off quest objectives.",0,1

"The singleplayer campaign for this game is literally just a spam of grenades.  On the hardest difficulty setting, you can have as many as THREE active grenade-warning-indicators at your location at a single time + infinite enemy respawn. No other call of duty that I've played has had so many grenades being chucked at you. The only way to complete levels on this difficulty is to just rush through.  The sniper boss fight segment is almost impossible to do on the hardest difficulty as well and makes no logistical sense (the enemy sniper does not obey the laws of physics or any constraints of the human body in how fast he can get from window to window to ruin your day)",0,1

"I'm reviewing solely the campaign portion of World at War, since that's what I got the game for and all that I've played.  Years after enjoying World War II shooters like Medal of Honor: Frontline and Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, I wanted something of the same mold. After asking people and reading reviews, I believed that World at War would have the best campaign yet.  I would be disappointed.   From beginning to end, World at War lacks intensity, persuasiveness, and engagement. The game places you onto tracks upon which you complete missions by going through a series of checkpoints. The campaign rushes through the war to put most of its focus on the last months before the Third Reich surrendered, so the momentum’s on your side from the start and nothing you and your squad do actually matters. You play a Russian and American soldier alternatively, who both get undue amounts of recognition by their squad leaders while remaining privates throughout their careers. Insufficient effort is made to make either character feel like your own; instead, you’re seeing their experiences in first person. Treyarch apparently intended to portray common soldiers as unrecognized heroes, and the game developer did an admirable job at that. But besides engendering respect, nearly every other aspect of the game falls short of what even predecessors had.  Whereas in Frontline, many of your missions were done alone and getting to work with teammates was a treat, here, you are always fighting with comrades. There is no infiltrating a village or mansion alone, or completing a mission by modulating your pace and playing style. Instead, you go down hallways and courtyards with your squad, occasionally getting to choose whether to take the right, left, or center path to kill the enemies your allies may take out anyway if you let them. Unlike Big Red One, formerly intimidating trenches are just places to rush in and out as you proceed to your next objective, which will be no more interesting to complete than the last one.  During each mission, I hoped that the game would finally become fun, but by the time around ten hours had elapsed, the campaign was complete with few instances worth remembering, and those few were times when I’d all but ignored my squad to assault the enemies alone for brief action-packed moments before getting killed.  One the whole, the World at War formula’s something like this: Wait to get ambushed. Pick up that weapon. Kill those guys (if you can, before your too-ballsy-to-live squadmates rush out and get themselves killed, not that it matters). Move to the next point. Rinse and repeat. If World at War’s placed in a nutshell, it won’t want for room.",0,1

In fact this game has repeated scene from the first and second call of duty, and Medals of honor; Pacific Assault. But overall it's still a good game, especially the multiplayer and the first with nazi zombies.

This didnt happen for me, so given that there is an overwhelming majority of positive rapport i felt i should warn that, for some people, this may not be a game you'll enjoy.",1,0

There are several bugs in the game that there are no fixes for and which get you stuck, permanently. So if you didn't make a separate save (not auto-save) then you basically have to start over. The first time it happened I had a save from like 10 hours previous, very frustrating but I kept playing. Then it happened again on another quest.

"This game is Good but not great. First off the muliplayer is a mess, in many ways it adds onto and improves on cod4's  mechanics (such as customible killstreaks and pro perks as well as more weapon diversity). But on the other hand you have  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like one man army noob tubes, commando, deathstreaks, Akimbo G18, and danger close that ruin the games balance and enjoyment.    The single player campaign is good and tells a compelling story but there are some things that aren't well explained and can leav you confused. The spec ops mode is just the campain exept with coop, fun, but doesen't really hold your attention for that long so feel free to skip it. But what hurts this game the most is the optimization, never in my life have I ever seen a game so effortlessly ported to the pc. The game is locked at nauseating 65 FOV (field of view) which will automatically makes the game feel weird to play since you are essenially staring through a pair of binoculars, thankfully there is an FOV changer that you can download for the muliplayer so make sure to get that if you ever plan on getting this game. Plus there are, get this, NO DEDICATED SERVERS.   Yep, no dedicated servers, basic pc features are non exsistent in this game! The lack of dedicated servers is what killed this game, instead of dedicated servers we get a crappy host based matchmaking system where everyone has to leech off of one guys connection meaning if the host has a bad connection you will have to play with laggy hit detection for the rest of the match. Oh and who can forget the oh so wonderful host migrations? Also the game is filled with hacked lobbies up the wazoo and some of them automatically rank you up to level 70 and give you everything ruining most of the replay value. Overall Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a disapointment and don't let any fanboy convince you that it isn't. I wouldn't recommend this game due to the how many asinine descisions were made with the port. But if you are still intrested in getting the game then be my guest, maybe you will be more satisfyed by what you got then I did.",0,1

Ofcourse their are alot of people that love that play style which I have to respect. What I can not understand, is how people keep buying these series of COD, expecting them to add some kind of anti hack engine when you know after so many series they havn't and never will. Those people I will always call insane.   I hate this game so badly I wish I can remove this game from my library... NOT ASKING for Refund!

"So close, so very close. This game was almost good. It had a lot of good ideas, but did not follow through with any of them. Everything in the game feels just short of being good. It is probably a case of trying to do too much. Rather than do a few things very well, this game tries to give you everything, and none of it quite makes the cut. The plot takes some interesting ideas, but does not develop them very well. The setting starts of interesting looking, but is not fully realised. The combat system could have been the best, but the mechanics just do not quite work properly. The Quests try to do something a little different, but they still manage to feel stale very quickly. This was almost a really good RPG, but instead it feels thoroughly disappointing.",0,1

"After playing 12 hours (and even days of playing on console and other accounts) of Call of Duty V: World at War, I can say this game is dead. Well the multiplayer version is due to the lack of good quality servers; most of the servers now are level boosting, bazooka and rifle grenade chaos. Despite the care for hackers, they have ruined it for the consoles but on here its somewhat tolerated. The only thing now is the zombies; the mini game that brought Treyarch its name today. This game mod origanally has 4 WaW maps and now has a plethora of Custom Zombies maps. The only real purpose of this game now the zombies. Unfortunatly, I do not recommend this game now.

Basically the game throws you into 3-4 minute load screens and that's not even the worst of it. Sure, you can run around and kill whoever and whatever you want, but the missions are all, and I mean every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ one, is a kill this many people or keep this many protesters at bay. There's nothing else to this game.  Still want to play? Enjoy the worst voice acting I have ever seen and somehow, the graphics look worse than Postal II. The gameplay and weapons are all grotesque, and not in a good way. The 'sick humor' is about as sick as my dying veteran, grandpa, bland and just lies there laughing to himself like a four year old that finds the word 'booger' to be the funniest thing ever.

"Ugh. Lets all just say it. You are here so you can get the TF2 item.  Let's break down how terrible this game is.  There is a complete lack of good graphics, and frankly ugly. The controls are awkward and random, making the understanding of the controls awkward. There is a frame rate issue that I couldn't fix, not because my system can't play it, but because it is just poorly created and rendered.  The game doesn't go fullscreen, it has this halfway point which it sticks at. Oh, and headshots don't kill....? The tutorial was long and unclear, with poor audio. The game looks about an tenth as good as the trailer, it really is a waste of time. The main menu was confusing and poorly formatted, making it difficult to even find the tutorial missions.  The game itself crashed several times. For no reason whatsoever.  Overall I recommend this game to no one. This is the worst game I have ever played on Steam. Hands down.",0,1

"This is a pretty long game with good voice acting and story for the main quest line, but outside of the quest cutscenes most of that time is spent doing unfun things. Travelling, fighting, looting and mini games all are just not done well compared to many other games.  The fighting is way too easy to be any sort of fun and when your character is hit you stagger which interrupts any sort of flow. If an enemy does manage to hurt you, instant use health potions make it impossible to ever die in this game. Enemies popping out of the ground constantly is annoying and you may quickly find you get sick of it all and just run past as much as you possibly can. If you ever get into a tough fight, you have an *I win* slow-mo mode that also gives you bonus XP for using.  The looting is crazy, with chests littered all over the place. You'll quickly fill your backpack with loads of vendor trash to accumulate useless gold with. On top of that your armor takes damage for no apparant reason so you will have to go back to town to get repairs.  Inventory management is a pain with the massive piles of loot you get, which isn't helped by the fact that there are a billion different slight variations of potions you'll never use because the fights are so easy. Also many quest items are bugged and will permanently suck up your inventory space, yuck.  The minigames are just dumb time wasters. There are two to unlock chests, the lockpicking mostly is just holding a key down and waiting as the default position will unlock a chest most of the time. The dispelling of a chest is slightly more interesting but quickly becomes tiresome on the far far too common chests.  Outside of the main quest line and faction quests, which are good, there isn't a lot of variety with most being go to spot X on the map and kill a bunch of things and come back. The pirate DLC quest series is a standout and if you do decide to get this game (don't) and make it to Rathir then pick up the 'Legend' DLC as it is as good if not better than the main game.  This could have been a pretty awesome game with some tweaking but the good bits are buried under way too much tiresome muck you need to shovel through.",0,1

"The game is broken, if you email  'arkhipov@akella.com'  then we're likely to get the achievements fixed.   First impressions so far.  I downloaded the game. (wish I hadn't). Clicked Play. I saw a picture of Uve Boll sticking his finger up at me, The game then crashed. Yep, that's basically my expectations for the rest of the game. I then started the tutuorial and was told to ingite some zombies. INGITE. (That's not my spelling mistake, that's exactly how it was spelt and what the game told me to do.  They've also slaughtered the Source engine, it's no wonder we don't have Half-Life 3. Valve had to make another engine after this game was released.  Also, for those of you that like your Source console commands and your Postal experience in 1st person mode. You get to eat ♥♥♥♥ because typing firstperson into the console tells you that the game is already in first person. (even though the whole game takes place in 3rd person). Entering thirdperson makes the camera aim straight at the floor. So instead of using the default 3rd person mode that Source uses they've decided to use the first person mode and pull the camera back, for some reason.   I was also told not to press a button, so I'm not whilst I currently wait for the game to progress. After I spent waiting the game started to insult me for doing exactly what it told me to do.   The people that made this game should kill themselves. I'm not joking. They've made a mess of the Source engine and a mess of the Postal series.",0,1

"Welcome to the world’s most fun over rated pile of ♥♥♥♥.   Since I first got a PC nearly 3 years ago all I have ever heard is counter strike, counter strike, counter strike. And, after about 15 hours of play time I see why.   Right away I can see that when counter strike came out it was the magnum opus of the fps/multiplayer genre and I can respect that but that also explains the largest problem with counter strike, its nonexistent learning curve. For the first maybe 3 hours I played on a few different servers and never killed a single person. I figured I’m new to this and it seems as thoe these guys/girls have been playing much longer than I have been so I began to brush it off and then 2 hours and may servers later I had killed maybe 6 people, not much had changed. And then remembered that that’s stupid, I shouldn’t be playing against people that have 150 hours clocked while I have 5.  Another problem is the weapons  I can understand the weird names, Valve would have been a smaller company then and saved a buck by naming them weird stuff but that doesn’t mean I won’t still make fun of them. The damaged ratio is also complete ♥♥♥♥♥. The sniper rifle is a one hit kill the subs are useless and I was once hit across the map with a shot gun blast. The knife is a bit under powered but Thats better than it being a light saber. And For some reason the only guns that are ever used are the AK look alike the M16 look alike and the sniper rifle.   I should say that counter strike is not a bad a game. It's for sure a sextillion times better than any Call of Duty ever made. And I will confess that this game is more fun giving your friends ADHD kid a gram of cocaine and telling him his dad is made of candy. But it’s also as frustrating as trying to put that same kid in a car seat. ",1,0

"It could have been fun. But there are no dedicated servers, so one of the players is chosen to serve as host, which usually results in a terrible connection and a lot of lag. Once the game notices that, it looks for another host. The original host is kicked after the host migration (because the game obviously has to be as annoying as possible), and the thing starts all over again. If no other host is found, everyone is just thrown out of the game. There is also no way to kick or ban the hackers, which is great fun as well. The same thing goes for hacked lobbies - sometimes, you join a game that is modified, meaning some weapons can't be used, the game mode is different, your settings and stats can be changed and other things. Of course, there's nothing you can do about it. Dedicated servers would fix that as well. Of course, those are impossible, because Activision says so. Giving you the ability to play the game mode you want without lags and with the ability to ban hackers could actually make this game fun! We obviously can't have that. So: If you're lucky and get a host with a good connection, you can play the Team Deathmatch mode. No one bothers to queue for other game modes, because there's not enough people playing them - of course, hacked lobbies do have other modes from time to time. And if you're really, really lucky, maybe there's no hacker in the game either, so you can even enjoy it.",0,1

"Be aware of Aeria Games. They are a large f2p game publisher with many titles, and many genres; Mostly fps and mmorpg. They are known for their numerous pay-to-win models, where those to throw cash away to buy powerful guns for use on those that haven't spent anything. They intice more people into playing their games by partnering up with other companies and creating promotional content, i.e. the black rose in Team Fortress 2.   AVA was not always in the hands of aeria games, and when it wasn't it was a generic fps that was great for a few minutes of brainless shooting. Now it's exactly the same thing, only with a pay-to-win scheme along with many hackers who wish to get their own overpowered slaughterhouse feel without paying.  Not worth your time to download. In fact, I would recomend against downloading, as it will install a rootkit for anti-cheating purposes that will cause many problems and is a pain in the neck to remove.",0,1

The world is pretty large and varied and the powers are fun as hell. But the combat in the game is just abysmal and you will spend 90% of all boss fights and large encounters stun locked. About the worst thing you can do to a player is not let him do anything in combat except be ragdolled around because literally every enemy down to the smallest soldier has a gigiantic aoe attack that stuns you. Hope you like getting chained down 100 to 0 over and over again. Unless you like running in hitting one punch and then jumping away to heal 70% of your health for 1 minute so you can jump in and punch once again. Just painful and slow. It may have fine in 09 when this came out on console but it has not aged well.   Story is good at least.,0,1

"First off, the 6 hours on record would constitute my second time attempting to like this game, after about 15 spent a year of so back. Sadly, it's another failed attempt.   The game has a lot of quests, loot, crafting, decent combat and a very rich world, with extensive lore. Then why do I always feel bored 30 minutes into a play session? Mostly because it feels like someone took a generic MMORPG and tried to make a single player game out of it.  - The crafting feels useless, just a time sink. - The abilities, skills also feel useless, since your character grows in strength mostly due to changing equipment. - The open world feels empty - I felt like looking at one of those driving scenes in old movies with bad background work. The images change but you know they're not real. At some point pretending to use the steering wheel becomes pointless. - The rich world filled with lore I mentioned above? Completely boring and bland. For all the dialog available, I found myself skipping through it, realizing that I would forget it anyway 2 minutes after the conversation ended. - There was some thought put into enemy design, you will encounter very different types. Too bad the AI is truly poor, and you can literally go through them by button mashing away.  The only slightly redeeming quality is the combat, as it offers you plenty of options in killing those forgettable enemies I mentioned.  Overall, you might enjoy this to pass a bit of time, but it's definitely not worth going through the whole story. It's only the illusion of a fully realized RPG, and it's all downhill once that becomes apparent.",0,1

"First off it should be mentioned that 'Dead moutaineer's hotel' is an old russian movie, which would be fine if the store page would mention it, so you could research the movie at least a bit in advance.  Both Knox and VanDine would turn in their graves when seeing this misleading summary, that actually makes you think this is a fair and square detective mystery, while it actually isn't. And even if you are tolerant enough to call it a detective mystery you will soon find out that it isn't fair at all, since:     The number of clues telling you that everyone here is an alien robot,built to observe humanity is exactly zero.  Rather late in the game you get a clue that aliens might be somehow involved, by finding a strange device which would as well be a very sophisticated bomb.  But no matter how you look at it, its not enough of a hint to make you even remotely aware that EVERYONE (the detective included) is just an alien robot. The only remote clues in that regard you ever get is hearing that one of the cast apparently carried out some superhuman task (Think it was carrying a safe on her shoulders), as well as aforementioned strange device. - Notably very close to the end of the story.  But even if you consider this a detective mystery with sci-fi elements this clue, as well as the device simply come to late for you to be able to make 'xyz and txz are in fact alien robots.   And yet again, even if you would consider this a valid clue, there is no clue at all that you, the detective himself and the entire rest of the cast, is one of these robots too.     As a movie adaption - passable  As the detective story it pretends to be however it fails hard.",0,1

"I have played the non legacy versions (which I assume are the more modern versions?) of 1, 4 and 5.  Space Quest 1. Could not play, it looped the intro over and over. Space Quest 4. If there is loading it takes forever and there is a lot of loading. Also the cursor keeps flickering. Played it for a few minutes and then got annoyed. Space quest 5. See 4, same loading issues but a little bit less often and long. Same cursor issues. I have played this for 2-3 hours and it seems like a very fun game but the loading is taking to long (there is sometimes even loading when just looking at an item or wall!)   Also in general you can not change resolution or scaling. So you are either stuck on full screen with horrendous pixels or stuck in a very very small window. If you alt tab and tab back again the game goes in windowed mode. There is no button to switch. (alt+enter switches)  Fix the loading, cursor flickering and give me a scaling option for windowed mode then we talk again. Right now, I deem this unplayable.",0,1

"I don't do the MP, so this is all about the SP. I put about 160 hours into this game on PC, completed all the missions multiple times on the highest difficulty, and have almost all the achievements. If I can do that, then better players like you will do great for sure. Overall, the game was not a waste of money, but it is sad to see a great franchise focus on the features I like least. I haven't bought a COD game since this one and based on watching other people play them, I am glad I didn't. If you want the best COD experience, COD4 or COD2 will serve you well. Never played COD3 since I don't own an Xbox or whatever console that was exclusive to.   If you liked COD: Modern Warfare, this game will appeal because it is pretty much the same game with lots of minor changes. It expands on the trends that set COD4 apart from the original WW2 shooters that COD was built on, expanding the special operations focus and focusing on bond-style villains weaving fancy plots to run the world in some way.   Technology also is greatly emphasized; COD4 was built on real weapons in wide use in the early 21st-century, while COD: MW2 makes commonplace what is rare or simply theorized even today. Most guns now have electronic sights instead of ironsights, automated weapon systems like sentry guns play a prominent role, and remarkably efficient UAVs with more firepower than a B52 menace the skies. If you want a more sci-fi than real-world experience of 'modern warfare' then you have found your game. Incidentally, the poor RPG7 rocketlauncher remains a big part of the battlefield and remains unable to hit anything more than 30 feet away without a huge dose of luck. So much for modernity!   If you like the classic 'common soldier fighting for his country' theme of the original COD series, you will be in for some, but not complete, disappointment.There are maps where average soldiers still fight average soldiers from other countries, but where they are fighting often requires considerable suspension of disbelief. What is clear is that COD: MW2 is continuing the trend of the franchise towards special ops missions where the real story revolves around elite special forces units who battle sinister evil geniuses weaving great conspiracies. Common soldiers like Paratrooper Martin and Sergeant Moody are very much passe. If you want Splintercell without the stealth mechanics, this will do something for you.   Like COD4, maps are tight enough to keep players from getting too lost and open enough, most of the time, to let players do more than simply charge straight into killzones. Some maps have tedious bottlenecks that will frustrate, so expect a few ragequits unless you are a masochist like me. So far, the grenade spam problem that makes many COD games very annoying is not too strong here; certainly not as bad as COD: World At War. You will have time to rest between rushes without too much fear of an endless rain of grenades appearing out of nowhere to punish you for your laziness. Infinite respawns are pretty reasonable in this game as well, so you aren't always going to lose for not having rushed after that last enemy getting shot.   One huge feature that greatly limits the appeal of this game for me: NO PC CONSOLE! COD consoles have always been fairly limited in their utility compared to games like Halflife, but for reasons that make no sense to me, IW has decided that players don't need consoles and so now players have no ablity to fine-tune their game settings, use cheats, or even fix some issues that could have been done in the past with five seconds of typing. This massively reduces the playability of the game for me. Before this game, I loved to see the beautiful animations and graphics in slow-motion. Can't do that here and that makes me sad.  ",1,0

"After the awesome first Modern Warfare the series just got ♥♥♥♥ed up. The beginning of that made MW2.  Story sucks compared to MW1. Where MW1 tried to create a 'authentic' atmosphere, MW2 is just unrealistic and ridiculous. It had its moment though. The gameplay is mostly ok; there is not much evolution, but with some interesting, but infrequent, levels which give you the choice of how to act. The SP is worth a try, even though it isn't as good as MW1.  What totally ♥♥♥♥s it up is the MP. MW1 was basically good, but had some issues. Instead of fixing those, Activision deceided to screw the game totally. Here are some reasons. If you are a fan of MW2, please do me a favour, and explain how you can enjoy the game with such problems.  -Way too small maps for the amount of players. Cluster♥♥♥♥ all day long. -Complemented with a stupid spawnsystem.  -Matchmaking, no dedicated servers. -Killstreaks. ♥♥♥♥ sake, I don't get it. How can people enjoy it, getting instantly ♥♥♥♥♥ 6 or 7 times in a row by a guy in a OP Apache in a game which is all about CQB? -Stupid perk system. Why the hell is there a perk which increases your bullet-damage?! -Zero weapon balance. G18, enough said. -Hitdetection and hitboxes. Watching killcames in this game makes me sick.  -And last but not least a totally immature community which is screaming 'ANAL' in voicechat almost the whole time.   I don't understand how this game can be so popular. I also don't understand why Activision decided to kill the franchise and create the CoD disease we have today. Get MW2 for the SP or the COOP. The only way you can have fun with the MP is in a private lobby with 3 of your friends, disabled killstreaks and some rules.",0,1
" I love Counter Strike, I should end it here. But I'll be honest and say I grew up with Source, wasn't old enough to experince 1.6 sadly.

"Loot system isn't great. Lacks environment diversity, and many mechanics present in other examples of this genre, such as locking on enemies, which is very annoying. The game becomes boring very fast.",0,1
"From content standpoint this game likely merits a 90/100 score. its big it has a lot of stuff and quest and tons of voice acting everywhere, the artist are very creative, and it looks good, the game engine is suitably powerful and technically better than its competitor Divinity 2. its a very playable game. But...  ...I did not really enjoy playing it. I played about 92 hours, so its very playable or I wouldn't waste 1 hour with it. For I have no reason except the enjoyment of the experience (there may be some other reasons... but thats mainly what one plays a game for).  The main story isn't all that great. I never felt drawn into the lavish story line. The character are all meaningless, one never ever cares anything for any of them. I think the literary elements are destroyed by the open ended questing system (I would have closed the questing system so it must be played in a certain order. This would have helped much to draw people in to the experience). There is never any sense that anything matters at all anywhere in the world.  The inventory and character management system works, but I would say a patch should have fixed its crudeness. It should have been easy for such skilled developers to polish this system as it's so important to any game of any genre.  But my number one gripe by far for this game is the camera. I just don't want to play it anymore because I am sick to death of staring at my characters backside while I play. The camera is just terrible. All one ever does when playing is stare at the ground and at your characters backside. This should have been fixed immediately. It is the easiest thing to fix. Divinity 2 does a much much much better job with the camera. Though Skyrim V is the best and most popular of the genre I think. These sort of games need a first person perspective. The camera view is half the game.  There are other things too of course. But my other serious issues pertain to genre and game development descisions on a broader level, so to say, these sorts of problem are simply the norm right now. So I won't bother talking about them. I'll try to judge this game against its competitors, not because I have too but because I want too. If a developer reads this, -----------------FIX THE CAMERA!--------------------   The quest camera which locks the camera onto the face of NPC's whenever there is something to talk about in the game is also annoying, and would be better if it was more semi-iso-metric. The NPC's faces look stupid and wooden and I hate looking at them. I want to throw rocks at them and poke them with sharp things while they speak.   Games have always been stupid, idiotic non-sensical rubbish. One of the greatest in history involved single handly traveling to hell, completely alone, wading through hordes of incredible murderous demons. For a bunny rabbit... Literally...  I think this game takes itself wayyyyyyyy too seriously. For the level of literary wit it possesses. It wants to be super great and legendary, but its just isn't.... Its obvious the developers don't know much about anything, its just money, and that what they needed to remember in there case. They just want to make money and care nothing about all these extremely serious issues they talk about, that have nothing to do with money at all. In other words it would have been smarter to go more stupid rather than try elevate the genre up to a level serious literature. Why doesn't our hero just chase some ♥♥♥ into hell for all it matters. That would work much better.  Is it possible to create a game masterpiece? Will the game world one day have its truly great playwright(s)? Probably. But Kingdoms of Amalur deffinately ain't it.  I talk like this because there is a whole lot of talking and acting in this game and a huge heavey duty ultra-serious life and death and the meaning of everything and more than that too - plot in the game. Which is why I mention playwrights, and am refering to high quality richly respected writers in general. There is a real desire in the game that is obvious, to raise the medium of gaming out of its non-sensical idiot past, and make something really great. But in my opinion this effort eats turf.   I give this game a 60/100  Bottomline: if the developers fix the camera I would say one can have fun playing this amusing bit of rubbish. Theres tons of special effects and environments and tools and weapons and beasts and battle skills to use - though the death physics are terrible, but standard in the industry. I get no satisfaction from killing monsters at all. Where is the decapitation, the slicing in two, the smashing to bloody hamburger special effects. There is nothing, its unbearable to me. This game is so full of unholy filthiness and cruel unhumanity smashing the damn things to bits is the only enjoyment I get from playing and it isn't there, nothing - otherwise give it a pass. Actually just give this game pass. The market is soo bloated with options, players need to discriminate. No Affirmative Action for Amalur, time to move on. Time is valuable.",0,1

Was this game (or series of games) worth the value? Absolutely not. Why did I buy the game then? You may ask this rightly and the answer is entirely sentimental. I loved the genre of game in its hayday and played this series of games with a fondness that is nearing reverence. As such, reliving some of my lost childhood was probably justifying the price paid for the Space Quest collection.  Imagine my deep disappointment then when trying to start any one of the games in the collection only to be met with the void of game failure. That's right folks, the games don't work. I'll reiterate for clarity: they do not work!  As a result of this I have come to the very sorry conclusion that no longer will I ever provide Valve a penny to relive some of my lost childhood memories. The price is already ridiculous and the value to cost ratio is further pushed towards a level of disgusting by the fact that the games simply don't work.  Feel free to return my money steam - i'll give you the game back.  So. In summary:  - game collection is too expensive - game doesn't work - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t",0,1

" Edit: I finished the game, to check if that review was made too hastly. It is not; I stand by my point: this game sucks, and I am pretty sure that the reason why bad reviews are systematically poorly noted is that there are people who's interest is to sel... erm, downvote bad reviews of that game. DO NOT BUY. IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME.   I expect this review to be poorly noted (around 0%, maybe a bit more if I'm lucky to be read by someone honest), just like ANY other bad review on this game (I won't write here what are my takes on 'why', I let the reader figure out by himself why ALL the bad reviews on this game are poorly noted, whatever they may contain).  This game is not a pretty game. It's from 2007 but looks like it was from the early 2000 (LOTS of bump mapping, low-def textures, bad animations, very low poly models, etc. - I'm, of course, running the game on 'best' settings for everything; and honestly, as pointed out by one of my contacts, it's not due to the engine, which is pretty solid for the epoch, but rather to the lack of artistical direction, and very poor graphical choices). This game isn't a fun game either: the gameplay is utterly repetitive, the immersion is inexistent, there is no challenge either, and the time-based mechanics are interesting for a few minutes at best.  The player is left without any instruction, without any guidance on how to use the controls, without any background story, without anything that can help immerison, or interest: to imagine what playing this game is, just imagine downloading a random indie FPS with funny, unusual controls, with a random map, and stupid A.I., and you'll get close to what that game is.  I haven't played enough to give more insight about that crap, but I surely regret having spent 5 bucks into that. There are PLENTY of better games to buy, from Singularity (that also features some time-control mechanics) to Hard Reboot, and so on. Don't waste your time (especially) or money on that one, not worth it by any extent.",0,1

" Counter strike is one of the first-played video games when I had a PC 9 years ago.  I had an illegal version installed from a third party website, yes I never heard Steam before. And sitting there, playing against bots almost over the night.  Display - A CRT monitor about 15.6 inches. Processor - Pentium Celeron singel core processor with 2.3 GHz. Graphics - nVidia Geforce 4 MX440  Memory - 256 MB with uknown specs anymore. Up to 80 GB hard disk storage that's all I got.  Later on more games came to me running on this PC for more than 2 years before I got a new one. Wolfstein, Battlefield, Medal of Honor, Half Life, Voice City and something like these. ",0,1

"Bland world doesn't develop as you progress, same assets are used everywhere. Story after the introductory CGI only gets worse and worse. The final battle is just meh.  After almost 10 years still has game breaking bugs. At certain point it's impossible to progress if the barrels are destroyed by scripted event, the grate is not thrown away by explosion and you have to explode the barrels yourself for it unlock the path what's a bit tricky to do. When solving some puzzles the ability timer is drained too fast and you have to constantly retry it until it goes slower for no apparent reason. At certain point it's almost impossible to perform a jump you have to mash whitespace like crazy for it work. I've had to use online walkthrough to find workarounds for that nonsense.  15€ for this? No, i can't recommend it, it's a bad game, even by 2007 standarts.",0,1
"This is a pitifully disgusting game now. ruined by hackers and little kids. hell both i should say. shameless lag switchers, aimbotters, wallhackers, hacked servers. Hackers killed this franchise because they have no skills and choose hacks to be better. No hackers you will never be better, if you use hacks you are less of a person and skills will always be better than hacks. and btw, you are not a hacker just because you use hacks, the person who made the hacks is a hacker, you are just subhuman scum in the gutters of forgotten humanity. if i was a zillionaire *even if that was a money amount* id buy this fncking franchise and set it straight, bring back up dedicated servers, update it with the latest hack defenses, idk theres sh!t out there. if it wasnt for hackers and little kids this would still be The Number One FPS shooter of all time. yes. im not exaggerating. But it is nice to find that one rare match where no one is actually hacking and its a non hacked lobby and acceptable connection, thats when the beauty of the game truly shines through. i dont recommend you buy this game, but you can if you want. i just bought it for old times sake because i had it on PS3.",0,1

"Take on the role of Alex Mercer, a man who has no recollection of what’s happened to him or why, or how he came to acquire the shape-shifting powers he now possesses. Find the people who’ve done that to you and make them pay. The game -action, adventure, open worldish- sounded fun and looked fun, and I was very hyped to play it. I was also very disappointed when I finally did. Controls, though a bit wonky, are not difficult. You can change your body “at will” to attack enemies and destroy things, and when I say “at will” I mean you only have so many things you can change into. I think the most fun aspect of the game is the fact that you can ‘consume’ random people and then turn into them, and run/jump your way around pretty freely.   I’d say the graphics are dated, but it’s an oldish game, so it gets a slight pass for that. What it doesn’t get a pass for, however, is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance. For a 2009 game that should run like a charm on my computer, it sure worked like crap even at the lowest settings, lagging worse than Assassin’s Creed III - and at least that one had a reason to lag (no “low” video settings, hey). I’m also not particularly fond of the reddish/orangeish filter they use on later cinematics and gameplay time, I find it bothersome to look at.   Your character is overpowered, which is not bad in itself if you like an easy game, but it does make things boring after a while as it’s all the same; to tell the truth, it reminded me a little of God Hand for some reason, only that one was actually fun to keep playing. With Prototype, I did the first few missions and was bored out of my mind - that along with the slightly eye-hurting graphics and slight, random spikes of lag made the game truly disappointing.  The gameplay is pretty repetitive otherwise. Fight a bunch of bad guys, have them call in tanks and an airstrike, be chased, shake them off, rinse and repeat with a moderate variety of enemies and mutants to fight against.   It’s not a completely unplayable game, mind you. If you’re extremely bored and want to play something that doesn’t pose a huge challenge, it’s not a bad game and could even be considered entertaining. I liked the city, the chance to explore it some, the general idea of the game was good (though the story was a bit hit and miss with me), but the execution left a lot to be desired.  Perhaps if the game had lagged a bit less I would have enjoyed it a bit better.  I wouldn’t recommend this game, but I would certainly not tell you to steer clear from it either, as I feel it could be a lot more fun if you can actually play it sans the lag.",0,1

"The combat is fun. Unfortunately: The world does not feel open enough for an open-world RPG, and the NPCs are not interesting enough for a story-directed RPG. I normally do all the side-quests in an RPG, and in this game there are just so many that they burnt me out. The overarching story is embarrassingly generic. About a third into the game, loot drops become useless; crafting, on the other hand, is overpowered. Feels too much like it was over-simplified for consoles. No support or updates to fix issues.",0,1

"A quick disclaimer: I've only played through the tutorial. I think this is enough to review the game, but some may disagree. It's obvious that this is a failed attempt to move Disciples 2 almost verbatim into 3D space, so I'm comfortable laying this out here.  They tried so many times to make Disciple 3 the game it should've been, but it just never lived up to 2. I understand the desire to move the game into 3D, but all the wonderful visuals I loved from the first title were sacrificed in the transition. They changed the battle system to hex-based from static turn-based, like every other game in this genre that felt stale years ago (AoW, King's Bounty, HoMM, etc). While the audio wasn't perfect in the original, it has even less impact now that it did before.",0,1

I might just be a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but the games seem boring and look like total ♥♥♥♥ that make my eyes hurt. I know there are fan-made re-makes of some of these games with updated visuals. Try those if you're really curious about these games, but otherwise just stick with newer games if you're a fan of the genre. These games are also from the era when Sierra made games that if you didn't get a certain item and left the area, the game would be unwinnable as you couldn't go back to get that item you need to keep progressing. And this was all done so you'd have to call their pay hint line when you got completely stuck and didn't realize you had no way of figuring out the unsolvable puzzle.

"Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.  Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.  What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.  Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check. Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.  As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.  The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.  It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.  If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.  There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.  At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.  When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as 'same old' to us.  This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.  And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.",1,0

However, enemies soak up a half-dozen shots to the chest before dying, so you don't feel powerful either. Killing them doesn't feel like victory, it feels like a chore. The time powers are uninspired and not particularly useful.  And it's ripping off Half-Life 2 in a way that just feels pathetic.

Cons: - Hacker paradise - Pay-to-win - Confusing as hell menu screen (took me 5 minutes just to figure out how to get into a game lobby) - DLC are WAY too expensive for a F2P game (Seriously, sixty dollars?? Why????) - Gross 'female models' which break the immersion (not that there was much to begin with) - Game frequently disconnects from servers without any real reason (even on a good wired connection) - Game doesn't even run on fullscreen, plays in a weirdly dimensioned window (it did for me at least, I couldn't find any way to change it to fullscreen or a different resolution) - Did I mention hackers?

The Cons: No dedicated servers, extremely broken multiplayer (unbalanced weapons, broken spawns etc), no kicking banning or choosing map types either.

I also found that the character would lose punch ability and a restart was needed to regain it and also sometimes the 'exit vehicle' option didn't seem to work.

"First of all, I have been playing this game for 5 years and I have witnessed the decline of this game.  To start of with the positives:  + Good graphics. + Wide selection of weapons. + Wide selection of maps and game modes. + You used to be able to play this game for hours on end and not get bored.   Now for the negatives:  - The most cancerous community you can ever imagine. Full of 12 year olds who spam constantly and cry about pretty much everything, they single-handedly destroy this game without the following negatives being taken into account.  - No functioning mute button which is really needed with this community.  - Cheaters, they tend to come in waves when public cheats are released. Think cheaters in games such as CSGO are a problem? There is probably a 75% chance that you will face at least one cheater in the Matchmaking channel each game you queue up for - unfortunately that figure is not greatly exaggerated and that is only considering the kids running around with blatant wall hacks and 1 hit kill cheats.  - Terrible publisher, they honestly do not give a fk about what the community wants unless it affects their income in a positive way. Sure, I understand it is a business, but not investing in a functioning anti-cheat, and instead focusing on the new tier-spender (a pay-to-win model) to satisfying those credit card whales is not the way to maintain a game.  - Non-functioning anti-cheat, it's clearly not doing its job properly, and it gives random errors to legit players such as myself causing my game to crash for no reason.  - Free-to-play, you'd think this would be a positive, but any kid that gets banned cheating can easily make a new account and farm it to a level in a few hours which allows them back into matchmaking.  - Lag, this game has two servers to serve 6 continents; the EU server is supposed to support Europe, Africa and Asia whereas the NA server is supposed to support North America, South America and Oceania. It is not uncommon to face teams with 200+ pings on their closest server, and this game does not have an effective IP-restriction for those countries for which the license does not cover.  - Hit registration, if you play CSGO you've probably heard the common quote 'Volvo pls fix 64 tick servers', and guess what, AVA is a significant downgrade on those servers, I believe somewhere in the region of 16 tick servers. This coupled with extreme laggers (the average ping in EU is probably around 70 and over 150 in NA) leads to countless frustrating encounters where you hit people first on your screen but end up dying behind a wall to a 300 ping BR.  - RNG elements, in a competitive FPS, you would expect RNG (random number generation) to be kept to a minimum, but this game has shooting mechanics which revolve around RNG. First is bloom (how much the bullets spread while spraying) which is fine to have as RNG, but the other is damage - I have been in countless situations where I have head shot someone with a Para (one of the highest damage rifles which is usually a 1 hit head shot) but then die because he didn't die but sprayed 2 AK47 bullets (a lower damage rifle) into my stomach. In short, head shots are not rewarded sufficiently in this game.   - Updates, in short, there is a lack of new content in new updates, it revolves around the pay-to-play whales where they are given new weapons to pay for (and at an obscene amount too).   Do not waste your time with this game, the community is pure cancer, they are the most stupid people you will ever come across in your life. One last thing you should know is that even if this game has 5000 active players (which is a very high estimate), the most recent public cheat had something like 3500+ downloads if I recall correctly.",0,1

"I've been playing this game for 10 years (7 or 8 years on non-steam), and it still amazes me with the fact that people are still playing this game.   Met bunch of amazing people, learned english more than what school has taught me, joined and left great community every now and then; this game has a huge impact on my life, from personality to the way I see the world (not exaggerating).  Some people claimed they have slept with my family, some claimed they are not a hacker (while their crosshair moves furiously, claiming it was an earthquake), some other claimed they can play better if their ping was lower and some other claimed they have tracked my IP and are on the way to kill me. What a super friendly community.  Best multiplayer fps game in the history of mankind, never gets me bored with tons of user-made mod, and one thing that this game never cease to amaze me is the fact that this game has a better hitbox than CS:GO (come at me CS:GO plebs)  1.6/Counter-Strike, would get rekt by a player playing in the earthquake again",1,0

"Orcs Must Die is at its core a tower defense game, but in 3D, with a below average FPS element. If you are a fan of tower defense games, I'm sure you'll get a lot of enjoyment out of the game, since there is a lot of content.  If you are a FPS gamer however, you'll probably get bored very quickly, as I did. Orcs Must Die was probably never intended to compare to 'real' FPS games, and as such, the combat, difficulty, and enemy diversity and adaptation is lacking when you compare it.  It's really annoying that you can only recommend a game, or not. If you are tower defense player, Orcs Must Die is amazing value. If you are an FPS gamer, Orcs Must Die is disappointing.",0,1

"Even at some early points, surprisingly hard and frustrating. The opponents are close to invisible and invincible.

"FOR THOSE FROM CS:GO I'm sorry but it feels very strange, and doesn't make much sense. Given its differences in handling sensitivity, and just everything really, unless you're commited, you'll just got 40 to 160 on a DM like I did. Not the best experience, especially since there was nothing I knew to even improve.",0,1
This game is unlike the other counter strike games. This game requires a different type of skill. You have to become used to the recoil each weapon has. You also have to become familiar with the different advantage points of each map. I personally think this is the best counter-strike game.,1,0

"I'll remind you: I've played CS 1.6 into oblivion on another account. 101 hours is not the full representation of my gameplay in this game.   CS 1.6 is a classic game everybody almost knows what is, at least if you are an FPS player. Of course today it is very outdated and not something you would otherwise play as your main game, but it certainly is something to take a walk through every once in a while - especially as a trip down memory lane or as a fun little LAN game to take your mind off modern games, which can get tiresome after a while (at least in my honest opinion.)   I can definitely recommend this. I played it a lot, and all the while, despite my review of it, CS:CZ had an end consensus that was a better smooth gameplay somewhat, this is one of the best games of all time. At least in terms of the FPS genre. No doubt. But if you were to play it today, you'd have to be patient as the only people still playing this online are either veterans, somewhat experienced people or cheaters (on VAC-insecure servers which there also is quite a lot of.) If you're lucky, you might still find that some of the best servers that kept the community going might still be up. Maybe.   Tread carefully, but definitely try it.",1,0

"Gather 'round, kiddies, uncle Nax is going to take you back in time! From the throbbing peal of EA's branding to the steely sparkle trailing around the logo, Kingdoms of Amalur wastes no time in dating itself. By the time the game boots, you'll feel like you've jumped straight back into the golden days of 2006 as EA prompts you to create some account with them in glorious 1024x768 default resolution. You'll navigate treacherous options menus the likes of which have never even heard the words 'PC Port' before. You'll set the game difficulty to 'hard' and wonder if it makes a lick of a difference as you sleep through the tutorial. Your screen will whizz around in every direction at the barest nudging of the mouse!  -cue gory introduction cutscene to earn your M ESRB rating-  Behold! Graphics as 2004 intended them to- err, hold on a sec. Graphics as 2012 intended them to look! Your eyes will water and gleam with delight as upon your screen plays out visuals the likes of which early World of Warcraft could only aspire to possess (and probably achieved by Burning Crusade, I don't know, uncle Nax never got hooked on that WoW stuff, no siree). Your soft, gooey, colorful character springs out of a mound of corpses like some necrotic phoenix, ready to bop, slash, level, traverse custcene wheels (thanks, Mass Effect), and slog through menus as the RPG gods intended. Your Oblivion-playing friends are gonna be so jealous!  From simply turning your camera to navigating your inventory (and I get the feeling you'll be doing both of these things a lot), everything is designed with a controller in mind. Wanna grab that loot on the ground? F to interact, but left click 'take all' or no dice. Pop open your inventory with the I key, then click around to get to your gear submenus. Wanna don that sword? Better left click then push enter, or right click and choose 'equip.' Just clicking stuff won't do, that's too complicated!   Walk with me now, back, back. We'll step into an era with invisible walls and tight corridors, to keep the player engaged and never you mind that wooden slope that clips into the rocks and which is inexplicably uncrossable. You'll pull a lever which dumps a corpse into an incinerator, which will then thump endlessly in there until you walk away. Why's it there? Immersion! Will you see something like this again? Nope!  Walk with me, walk further back. Further back? Yes, brave reader, we're braving the nineties and before! From the first few glimpses of action, we are beset by features etched far into the history of games and television alike!  Stock sounds!  Marvel, as the giant rats you encounter make -that one pig squealing sound- that you've heard a thousand times before! Behold, as the magic IEDs the immortal elves plant on some pillars explode with -that explosion sound- that you've heard from 1994 Doom's rocket launcher! Truly, we are living in the future.  We go any further back, and Uncle Naxza's gonna have to get unborn, so we'll stop here.  To put it simply, Amalur looks and acts dated from the word 'go.' It's an obvious, poorly-done PC port of a game made combining just about every generic RPG gameplay element of the past ten years, taking strong inspiration from modern MMOs and Bethesda titles. Areas are linear (even after you get out of the tutorial location) and lack any immediate distinction. You are pretty much 'the chosen one' living out your power fantasy of ripping up bandits and glorks and whatever else as you walk from idle NPC to idle NPC, waiting with punctuation marks above their heads for some brave hero to solve whatever ailment. The enemy AI is trifling (take four guys that stare at you and bob around while one of them winds up an attack, or bum rush the guy ahead of you while he makes threatening gestures for eight seconds), which makes even 'hard' difficulty feel like 'laughable' difficulty if you've ever played an RPG before.   And then there's the stock sounds. Call me a stickler for soundwork (and the music seems okay, if you excuse the predictably percussive battle drum music), but I lose faith in a title very quickly when it starts using stock sounds. I don't know, it's lazy. We've heard these sounds before, and if you're trying to make something new, or different, or stand out, using sounds that we've all heard before isn't the way to do it! I'm sure soundwork is expensive, and you don't need unique sounds for every facet of a game, but I don't know, maybe the sounds that don't feature in every cheap action flick/TV drama.  Harsh? Yeah. Premature? Maybe a little, I only have an hour and a half playtime at this point. First impression? Strongly made. Not good.  Buy the game? No. Buy the game on sale? Maybe if you're out of other RPGs to play (is that possible?) or you've never really played a third person RPG before.",1,0

"Addictive, dull, and repetitive, Counter-Strike will eat up hours that you'll want to have back. There are two newer iterations of this game now, both of which are similarly wasteful of time. While one might argue that any game is not a productive use of one's days, Counter-Strike ranks one step above almost anything out there: unless you're freakishly good or an inveterate camper, you'll spend the lion's share of your gameplay idly waiting to respawn. More, you'll inevitably (especially in 1.6) run into players so good that you'll be unsure whether they're superlative gamers or superlative cheaters. And in Counter-Strike, there's really no way of telling. Prepare yourself for frustration, either way.   Avoid.",0,1

"Kingdom of Amalur:Reckoning is a game that isn't special in any way, shape or form. At first it was designed to be an MMORPG, which shows in its world design. Sadly this design is completely uninspired, having different areas connecting awkwardly with a linear dungeon every here and then. Due to trying to be an MMORPG at first it is filled with a WoW-esque cartoony artstyle, minus the talent that was present in let's say WoW vanilla, TBC and WotLK. Even at its highest difficulty, 'hard', this is a game with zero difficulty. Primarily caused by the fact that you attack very fast, hit hard and have a great reach with most weapons. Secondarily caused by a gimmick that many games have, you, as the main character, receive some nonsense overpowered abilities that no enemy in the game can actually do anything against. So even if you somehow find an enemy that you can't stunlock in this game, you can just activate your power which slows down time and makes you hit harder to stunlock it anyways. But by all means, if you're interested in a game with a forgettable art style, boring story, combat so easy that you can hardly call it a game, poor voice acting, poor dungeon and world design, then this is the game for you.",0,1
"While I do love the detail put into the dismemberment and gore of this game, the story falls short and well, to be honest, some things feel weird.  I know, I know... 'It's an old game.' But that's not an excuse for the cars to seat deformed polygonal people inside. Some little things like that broke the inmersion and overall experience for me in big ways.  I'd say check out Saints Row 4. It's this game on steroids but add some personality, mature comedy and a slew of mini-games as well.  This isn't a terribly bad game, there's just better alternatives that are now available on the Steam market and well, this isn't worth the asking price. A fair price for this game would be 25% of what they are asking for.",1,0

"Don't listen to most of these reviews, as almost all the negative ones are from people that download it just to get the Black Rose knife in TF2 and don't take the time to even try to game. AvA has it's ups and downs and don't let these hours fool you, I've played a good bit on Aeria Games client and now the En Masse client. I figured since all the reviews are down voting the game and they aren't even giving the game as shot I thought Id pich in.  A.V.A was once an amazing free to play shooter, it had everything you wanted / needed in shooter and then of course Aeria Games does what they do best, and ruin titles by making them pay to win. First they started off by removing PERM weps and thats when it all went down hill.. back when IJJI had this game, it was amazing.  Aeria Games hurt this game badly, and honestly I don't see it recovering. Although A.V.A now has a decent publisher (En Masse) I just don't see the damage from Aeria Games being fixed. The likely hood of players giving this a game a shot again is very low.  The game is old, dying, and full of hackers. En Masse does a pretty good job of getting rid of all the hackers but they have yet to replace the anti cheat (XIGN CODE 3) so after banning someone, they simply make a new account. Also, En Masse banning hackers is hurting the game as well, as majority of A.V.A's player base is hackers, the player base has now suffered. I truly believe this is the reason Aeria never banned, as if they banned they would lose players and that would mean losing money. Overall the gameplay is fun as hell and very good for a FREE title. As a free player you CAN compete with someone who pays, but the game has too man problems and honestly don't see it ever changing now.  Give the game a shot, it's free. En Masse has done wonderful things already, but the damage has been done, sadly. If anything, download to get the BLACK ROSE!",0,1

"You are 14 years old, first time trying to play something multiplayer and online. You see this game, since you have a potatoe PC you start to play this game. Runs smoothly on 53 FPS, woow sounds are great, look an AK-47 but name CV-47 you play it you shoot, you get killed asking yourself how you didn't kill him cause you shot 27 bullets on that guy and he still is alive. You play it over and over, finally getting your first kill. (cause the enemy was coruching and looking the other way and you instantly kill him running 17 bullets spent) you get high hopes, I can play this game it is so easy. You get more kills, you get greedy you rush alone you get killed when you even thought about rushing by an AWP on mid. Ages pass, poeple pass, kills get comon. You start to play better, after 2 years you learn the recoils you learn the hidding spots, you know what is the enemy's next move. You practise your awp then. You play DM and DM only with an awp, your kills are slick, and your flicks are quick and accurate. Admin invites you to his clan. FIrst time you play this game with somenone for serious. You can't do anything cause you are not used to an opposite player to play smartly and you get owned, you don't do kills and your teammates question your skill. Couple more months pass you learn your duties as a teammate. You give info you cover you open. Clan gets closed down, you find another clan you are one of the best players. You play more switch clans for better ones. You get to LANs you get scared of the all expecations and so many eyes on you. You tilt and miss your shots, months pass, you get better, you become a man of steel and high nervous, 2000 hours pass you are finally a great player. 10 000 hours pass, you win LANs you play against better players, you try a gainst payed players you are toe-to-toe with them but you loose cause your team isn't on that level and they get scared. 20 000 hours pass game is dying and so is your love for this game. But no one can pay thoose voice chats from 8 P.M till 6 A.M every weekend with your friends. So much hours in this game and you acomplished nothing. You play against your local teams you get banned cause they don't expect somene to play that good without cheats and you stop playing this cause cheaters take over, very 12 year old first downloads a cheat then this game. You get mentally tortured cause the kid is telling you how bad you are and that you suck, you cry inside. Thinking what happened to me, how come this kid plays better then me, then you figure out the cheats are great, but you still play it fairly. You cry cause no one cares for e-sports in your country and no one wants to pay you for playing games. Your parents tell you you don't have a life you loose some friends, you loose your girlfriend you stop being active in sports. YOu just play this game hoping to be recognised, but you don't so to help everyone in this world after 30 000 hours on this game, don't play it it is a sinking ship and it is pulling you down. Tears are in my eyes for all the time I was good but now you can't play a normal match since cheaters will destory you... run READER, move away, press back and never turn back on this game..",1,0

"If you are even remotely thinking of buying this game, go buy Postal 2 first. Postal 3 is developed by Trashmasters (some would say they 'trashed' the game) and published by Akella (as opposed to Running with Scissors who both published an developed the previous game). Trashmasters left out the key concepts that made Postal 2 a good game. Very much a linear game no open world. The only benefit of playing this game is that when you eventually play Postal 2 it looks like a frikin' masterpiece compared to this.",0,1
"This game looked decent in the videos/reviews and I wanted to play a game of this type, so I gave it a shot. I was unimpressed. It quickly became work to learn the game mechanics and specifics as it was so boring and not fun. I did not like the game play or story. Skip.",0,1
"The story is very exciting,I like it,but the multiplayer is badly.Because there is almost nobody playing it.The health of enemy in multiplayer is higher than COD Infinity Ward series,not interesting like MW series and ghosts,even COD2.People who play it is less than COD2,so it isn't worthy to buy",0,1
"~8 years ago, a boy named Joe visited by his nephew, his nephew bring some flashdisk that included A game called CS, Joe Was so Hype to play that game.  ~2 years later he keep playing that game, but he never know that the game that he was played was Pirate Edition. The Community was Great untill someone asked him to create steam account, so he create it. but he never know who is the man that tell him to create steam account. poor him, he still dont know how to use it and abandoned his steam account.  ~Finally this Day Joe can buy a copy of Counter Strike Game that was launching at 2000.

"If you can't get Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, this is great replacement for it. It's not as popular, but it still has a big amount of players. Some servers may be in languages you can't understand, but the game is still very fun and requires a great amount of skill. One of the best first person shooters, that still holds to this day from 1999. Although the game's graphics...aren't really the best. Even then, you can get skins, map textures, etc. to spice the graphics up a little bit. Though to me, graphics don't really matter. Highly recommend this game. 9.5/10",1,0
"If you thought people dont play old games anymore, you're wrong. Counter-Strike is still a game with LOTS of players playing, despite the game being 15 years old so far. If you have a bad PC, dont worry, because Counter-Strike can run on almost any computer!  With excellent controls, skilled players, good graphics (for its time), a big variety of guns, the huge amount of servers, the anti-cheat system, good level design (official maps), Counter-Strike is one of the greatest FPS of all-time, and I think everyone should get this game as it is cheap.   If you are a retrogamer and you never played Counter-Strike yet, you gotta do it. You wont get disapointed. Not at all.  I dont have much to say about Counter-Strike... its just so good... everything about it has already been said by others... what should I say now?   if you think Counter-Strike would be a bad purchase, you're commiting a serious error. Just go play it. Go! Go! Go!",1,0

This game is awful! I only played so i could get the black rose knife for tf2. This game has terrible graphics and textures.. The sound cut out for half of the game. I get killed while i am falling from the air. Its just a crappy COD or battlefield game for all the people who can't get it. I know those games are expensive but play Team Fortress 2 or some other free game THAT IS ACTUALLY GOOD! The only good thing in this game is that hot girl on the cover art. Damnn. but other than that this is a ♥♥♥♥ torture of a game. Don't even waste time downloading this.,0,1

"Before I start I must explain that the reason I do not recommend this game is not because it is bad in any way, it is because its multiplayer is full of hackers/mods/spam and broken equipment (it also has no developer support).   The game is however very good, the single player has a gripping storyline that is full of action and great cinematic cut scenes. It includes a variety of wepons and settings so that each level is interesting, one level could take place in a desert and the next in a forest. There are intense moments and plot twists that really do get your emotions going, it's possibly one of my favourite story modes of all time. However it's slightly short and on veteran difficulty certain levels can be near impossible without touches of luck.  Single player also comes with 'spec ops' (which can be played co-operatively), spec ops adds another layer of difficulty to the story mode and alters story mode levels to suit a different challenge. It's divided up into a variety of categories including races so the diversity is enough to keep you playing when one type of mission is frustrating you. The frustration is worth it however as when difficult spec ops are completed you feel extremely satisfied.   Overall I would say it is a great game however its lack of developer support and its toxic hacking environment (online) mean it cannot be worth its price tag.",1,0
"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1,0

"Well the story was deacent. My biggest problem with the game is that in any given fire fight whoever shoots first will almost always win. there is too much recoil from being shot that there is no chance to get returing fire on the targate. Also, the number of enemies in each fire fight just seems wierd, there are never less than 20 enemies to kill at a time, for one person that is just not right, it makes the game feel fake.",0,1

"Would I recommend this game back in 2009-10? Yes.  Would I recommend this game now? No.  The game was amazing back in it's day, but now it's just filled with low-life hackers, who ruin the game.  When you want to play some TDM, 25% of the time you will be placed in a hacked lobby and promoted to 10th prestige without your permission (Happened to me). Also because of all the hackers/ the game not being updated, the population of the game is about 500 people, resulting in you playing with the game people from day to day. Don't get it, the game is dead. Yet Activision still makes you pay £20 for a out-dated game.",0,1

"This game did a lot of neat things for its time. But don't get it now. There's no reason to buy something that isn't an M4 or an AK-47, and if you are a CT that just got a kill, you drop your M4 and take his AK, unless you memorize the recoil pattern on the gun you're firing you will lose every time, not that it helps because anyone still playing this game has been playing for 13 years and will know where you are at all times and be able to AWP you a new ventilation shaft in your forehead from 400 yards the same second your arm moves into visibility from behind a door. Just hold your horses, and let's hope they save Counter-Strike's from itself with CS:GO",0,1

"If you played A.V.A. after I.J.J.I. was the publisher, I'm sorry if this game is trash. Aeria Games made this game unbalanced and unfair for the sake of milking what money they can get. They don't care much for you. I had no problems with the old publisher I.J.J.I. Instead of giving you a story worth of words, I'll list the dislike I had with this game After Aeria became publisher.  1. Temporarily disabled permenant guns. 2. Decreased the amount of money for supply drops. (Was 5,000e/Now2,000e)  3. Removed certain armor and equipment from store and removed option to purchase items for less than 30days and removed certain expandible items from store.  4. Replaced lottery guns with tickets. 5. Removed the option to create clan emblems. 6.Turned co-op missions into some cheesy cyfi ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You won't take co-op seriously from what they did to it.  7.Ruin infection mode, which was perfectly balanced by, adding stunning spores (removed), giving every infected spores, giving every infected boost ability (F), removing explosion from mines, adding hints for the host infected, removing gear for extra health for humans in store, removing gear for infected from store.  8. Made unneeded changes to co-op. 9.Removed green boxes from survival. 10. Terrible anticheat. 11. Overall ruined the looks and feels of the game and made it cringy and boring.   Aeria said they'll be leaving, which I'm so happy for. Hopefully the new publisher will fix Aeria's mess.  Want to play a good F2P FPS? Play Warface, Warframe, TF2, or No Room In Hell, or even freaking Combat Arms. I would even recommend Comabat Arms.  ",0,1

Lets start with some good news Pros  Funny story(And thats pretty much it)  Cons  Buggy gameplay  Rehashed jokes from the originals   No open-world   Third-person change  crappy new cover system   The saddest part is,its not rws's fault here its when they hired other companies to help and they burned all their money away and shoved this pile of filth out.

"Kingdoms of Amalur is what an MMO would be like without other players. Want to wander through cavernous environments rife with fetch quests? Do you enjoy immersion breaking question-marked quest givers? How about a bland story that tries very hard get you interested in 10,000 years of lore without providing an modern (within the game context) relevance? Those are the features of KOA that you'll encounter. The combat is interesting and refreshing for an action-RPG but that doesn't make a good game nor does it draw me in to the world. After 15 hours or so I found myself playing this game like Diablo, micro-managing stats and largely ignoring the talky parts. That would be fine if KOA didn't try so hard to convince you its story is worth knowing. This is a game built on the words of RA Salvatore, how it failed to tell a story is beyond me.   Pros: Frequently on sale, Combat Cons: Story, MMO-like mechanics without multiplayer, Abuse of the word RPG, Fetch Quests, Throw-away mobs.  ",0,1

"In 2007, CoD:MW (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare) was released into a community that has a seemingly insatiable lust for more shooter action. They weren't just given another shooter, they were given a game that really pushed the genre considerably. Amazing single player campaign and adrenaline-pumped, fast-paced multiplayer action with perks and weapon sets set the new standard on how these FPS's are done. It left it's mark on gaming as a whole, so a sequel was inevitable and gamers couldn't wait. In fact - according to an eye-witness who works at my local Game Stop - MW2 '...became the best-selling game in history before it was even released', all being pre-orders (of course, #1 sellers are subject to change). Imagine their dissapointment when they got this...  Plot 1/10  ..was so convoluted, I can't tell you what it was. Everybody wants everybody dead except the protagonists, and the only solution is...killing everybody. It's a movie written by Michael Bay. That's all I have to say about the plot without spoiling it. If you don't care (which you shouldn't), highlight this big, black box.    You meet Soap in the third-person, but it's so akward and out of his character to hear him talk. Then when you get back to playing as him, he stops talking again. For the main character of the first game being linked into the second game, he's just so seemed; so tacked-on and uninteresting. All the characters from the last game are 'magically' back too, despite being shot in the back of the head with Desert Eagles. Captain Price is back, but his acting and dialogue couldn't be more out of character. He went from rough, clever, and a cold sense of humor, to this...My Little Pony....thing. He's overly polite with no backbone. Imagine Mufasa suddenly with the mentality of Patrick Star, and you're not far off. Further, everytime I hopped onto an escape vehicle, I knew someone was going to shoot me because it happens like 4 times. When General Shepard reveals himself as the bad guy, it wasn't exciting. It was met with a loud YAAAWN. The twist is where the game's story slips into a void like a balloon into a hurricane. The player also 'dies' too much. Not in gameplay, but more like a scripted event/cutscene thing. Once again, *yawn*. The only intriguing part is when the EMP wipes out most of America's power. You and your team navigate a deathly-silent ghost town. It's eerie and very realistic; the best part of the game.    The ending also plays out like every other cutscene in the game: 'Good job, now let's carry you off and tell you who the kill nex-' CREDITS; THAR'LL BE A SEEQUEL!  Graphics/Sound 8/10  I'll put these in the same category because I don't have much to say about them. MW2's sound and visuals are everything we expect from the series: excellent. The guns, the dust, the lighting, character models are all beautiful, and guns, tanks, explosions all sound great, too; so why an 8/10? Attentive gamers will notice that a majority of this game's voice cast is from Mass Effect. In fact, several things were just 'taken' from Mass Effect. For one thing, your CO's voice is the voice of Captain Anderson, and the voice of the general is the voice of Admiral Hackett. Oh, and the general's name? Sheperd. There's nothing wrong with being inspired, but I call this a lazy, rip off. Infinity Ward wasn't even trying. Maybe I'm just being picky, but this really rubbed me wrong despite Keith David's long career as voice actor for military-esque media.  Gameplay 5/10  Finally, gamers are starting to see the light with the release of CoD:Ghosts. It's the same. Darn. Game. Same rail-shooter scenes, same set pieces, same 'set bomb and run away' scene, same door breaching scene, same, same, same. We've been playing the same game since the original Call of Duty in 2003 and before that with the Medal of Honor series. It's been 11 years of the same game. It's time for CoD to die. You run forward, you kill the next thing that moves, and steadily march to the credit roll. Everything about it is so banal; boring to the point of painful. The graphics and sounds aren't enough to mask the bad gameplay and story. A pretty package doesn't make the bad contents good. You've played CoD before. Enough said.  Multiplayer also went downhill with unbalanced weapons and killstreak abilities that broke the game entirely. When you get 3 kills in one life, you get a UAV that reveals all enemies on the radar. However, these streak rewards stacked with one another, so you use the UAV to get a few more kills, and get a chopper. The chopper automatically gets you 5 more kills giving you an AC-130 gunship. Use THAT for a few more kills, you get a nuke that ends the game instantly. Sounds pretty ambitious on pen and paper, but in game it means: first to a 3 kill streak WINS. Hackers also had their way with the game and Infinity Ward/Treyarch/Activision or all three refused to do anything about it. I've heard rumors that the same hacks that worked on MW2 also worked on MW3 and Black Ops. Watching this trend, I believe it.   If you want an example of customer service done RIGHT, let's ask Valve. Some time ago, Steam was glitching up and improperly banning players from accessing MW2. Gabe Newell wrote a personal apology to these gamers, and offered them a free copy of Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2). While that was generous and very polite, that might have been a bad idea for the poor people that play L4D2, because all the teenage @***holes from this game are now trolling the L4D2 community (as if that game wasn't bad enough.)  The Verdict  Visually, there's little to complain about. MW2 is very realistic by sight and by sound. Some of the settings are creepy with ash blotting out the sun and smoke rising from decimated vehicles and climbing corpses to escape combat. The whole world is going crazy, but they couldn't make the player care less. Traversing the beautiful world is an uphill hike to the credits. Yearly releases also means the community will be widely divided and chopped thinner and thinner with each release, so there's no point in trying to play MP. MW2 is big pass. Maybe get it for 5 bucks and beat it once. Final score: 3/10 Almost no reason to buy it.",1,0

"The best COD amongst all in my opinion but the PC version lacks many features in comparison to PS3/360 versions:  - Full controller support. - 2 local player Special Ops using split screen. - 4 local Multiplayer using split screen.  Call of Duty is, problably, the most expensive franchise ever. Many companies updated their games to the new demand and Activision didn't. Activision say that these updates in PC have many technical difficulties, come on...  I'm hopeless about a major update in COD:MW2, so I don't recommend this game because the high prize of this game (even on sale!) doesn't represent the real quality of the game (with respect to PS3/360).",0,1

"If you are expecting to use an Xbox controller with this game you are mistaken until EA or Big Huge fixes the mapping it is unplayable. You would think that this being a released on console they would have got it right on PC but as it is now it is currently unplayable with the 360 Controller. KB&amp;M work fine but this game was made for a controller, a controller that you cannot use because 1 button is mapped to 7 different actions and cannot be remapped. Makes using a 360 controller impossible. No fix on the any of the forums either..... If you want to play with KB&amp;M go for it might be a good game but if you might ever want to use a controller save your money it’s unplayable",0,1

I would recommend this but actvision seem to think that £1 = $1 so i recommend 1 of these 4 ways.   1. Waiting for it to go on sale on a website like  amazon.com  or any other website that doesn't use pounds this one would be the safest but you would be having to wait (or buy it off sale would still be cheaper).  2. Use a VPN this would be the more difficult one out of the 4 due to them being slow and finding one that you can use.  3. Get someone to buy if for you this is the way i did it but i would recommend getting a friend that you can trust to do it because get a some you don't know to do it they could easily take the money and run.  4. Buying it with TF2 keys this is be the best one out of the 4 IMO because people on trading websites like tf2outpost put trades up for it that use the price of it when its on sale (this only when the game is on sale)you also can buy TF2 keys for cheap from the community market its just finding some on outpost that is selling it for the sale price because of the websites crappy auto bump feature.  Its a shame because this is a very good game but i just cant recommend something that thinks that $1 = £1,1,0

"Bought this game after getting an itch for a new RPG. A lot of the game reminded me of Dark Souls, since the combat was pretty unforgiving and required precise timing. You cannot hack and slash your way through the game, which I liked.   However, if a game is going to be unforgiving, I am going to be the same way towards its polish. KoA has some pretty bad camera work that make timing the perfect dodge or counter attack near impossible once an enemy dashes behind you. The direction your character attacks is also subject to this issue. Spent far longer than I should have on some fights purely because the camera disagreed with me all too regularly.  The quests have the depth of your average MMO (go kill X enemy type, fetch Y item for me). I simply ran out of reasons to push forward through the game and was too frustrated by its problems.  The game also doesn't come with any options menu of any depth, if that's important to you. It feels very much like a mediocre (but not terrible) console port.  Unless you have a strong desire for a tough RPG, I would stay away. If you happen to really love those types of games, you may be able to push through the issues.",0,1

I must say it is original because I had never heard of LEASING items, not buying, leasing. I feel sorry for hardcore fans of this game because it must truly feel terrible to have a game you enjoy die.

"Buggy and frankly the missions suck. Stupid AI is constantly putting friendly npcs in front of you for you to shoot.  At one point I lost my weapon due to an attack from a dog. The notice that the dog attack remained on the screen and I could no longer pick up any weapon. Aborting the mission meant going back to the very beginning instead of that particular phase.  I recall playing COD (the very first one) a long long time ago and it was with a fond remembrance that I bought this game. Unfortunately the player in solo mode is too tied to his AI squad mates who are stupider than dirt. The graphics might be better than the very first COD, but not by much.

"4/10  This game has so much potential. I did enjoy the first couple of hours as I played it. But there are way to many side quest which makes it feel like the game progress really slowly. Which in turn makes it feel very repetative. The combat is rather one dimentional, it gets a bit better by the fact that you have a main and a secondary weapon. Also there varaity of enemys isnt that great either. For me it felt like much of the later fights was me avoiding getting hit couse every little hit staggered me so I couldnt attack and then pop in hits when there where openings. Perhaps its better if you use a quicker weapon and not a greatsword like I did. And talking about greatswords it felt like it droped alot fewer of them then of every other weapon. Well atleast compaired to longswords and hammers which I found plenty. I know I should have crafted a good greatsword. But then the entire loot system gets pretty boring as I can just craft the best gear. For the crafting to have been more fun there should have been rare crafting materials and that way not making looting boring.  I think it is worth giving the game a try. If you like the combat more then I did you will probably want to do side missions and let the game progress slower. Me on the other hand stoped doing side missions after a while and just got through the main story.  With a few changes this game could have been awesome. I think the world feels rather liniar even if its open. There should have a mount or similar for when you need to run a long distance (once you visited a place you can fast travel to it, and fast travel I did alot). The trainer system should have been made more clear. Lock picking needs a bit of tweaking, now its rediculusly easy (I didnt put one point into the skill and still I picked very hard locks only loosing 2-3 picks). Well in the end I do hope they will make a sequal which has a bunch of changes for the better.",1,0

"This game is a prime example of what happens when people that think game consoles were a good idea try to develop video games. Apart from the usual UI horrors (lengthy, yet unskippable 'presented by' sequence at every start, 'do not turn off power while the game is saving' notice at every start, extremely inaccurate mouse tracking, etc.), the aspect ratio is messed up (huge black borders; I've seen others complain about this on the forums, so it seems it isn't just me), the controls are clearly geared towards  (gag)  gamepads and the list goes on with all the classic nonsense that happens when a game is developed for consoles and then back-ported to PC.  What really tipped the balance is the fact that the performance is completely ruined by what, judging from what I read on the forums, is likely some severe issue with detecting the controls. After having spent days getting Final Fantasy XIII (which exhibits a similar issue) to run halfway decently, I frankly can't be  &lt;kinsoku jikou&gt; ed to find a series of hacks just to circumvent this ridiculous performance hit. Even on a state-of-the-art PC that runs all other (properly developed!) games smoothly on high quality settings, this game can only be described as 'unplayable' on PC. While there might or might not be ways to fix this up (apparently involving downloading hacked versions of game DLLs from shady one click hoster sites --  DO NOT DO THIS , you'll be inviting viruses, trojans and whatnot onto your system!), it can only be said that the average Joe (as in, somebody that isn't a computer expert) would have little chance to get this game to work properly (without blindly following quite dangerous instructions off the internet, anyway, cf. the bit about the modified DLLs).  On a more technical note, apparently there is a cap on the amount of video memory and exceeding this cap restricts the quality settings severly. The very fact that this cap is 2 GB rather than 4 GB (i.e. the so-called engine uses a signed integer to represent memory size) is quite indicative of whoever wrote this game not knowing anywhere near enough about programming to even think about making video games. I'm sorry, and this is not supposed to be flame bait, nor an insult, nor to be taken personally, but the preceding is simply a fact.   Bottom line : Unplayable on PC; cannot, in good conscience, recommend.",0,1

"Feels like running around inside the ghost of an MMO, which I guess it sort-of is. There were plenty of things that I liked about the game, but the empty feeling extends throughout, combat is entirely unchallenging (which is a damn shame as it looks and feels good, you just get bored of wading through mobs, swatting them like amazingly easy to swat flies. Pointlessly swatting already dead flies.), there are far too many meaningles and trivial 'fetch' sidequests, and the story really drags. There is stacks of lore but it was impossible to care about any of it in the slightest, because the whole game felt like an abandoned theme park.",0,1
"As a avid player of Match-3 games, and appreciator of the Puzzle Quest saga, I convinced myself to give Runespell: Overture a shot, intrigued by the fact you play with a standard deck of cards instead of coloured gems.  The first battles were interesting, the poker-like combos felt novel. Diving more deeply into the game, it got more depth with the addition of magic cards and sidekicks.  Unfortunately, it appeared that most of the magic cards are just copies of the same basic spell (unlike other games where fire, ice, lightning and poison have different tactical effects).  From that point, the battles felt too much similar to sustain interest, and the constant sight of these clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades turned the fantasy background into the trivial one your regular Solitaire.  These kind of games are supposed to be easy to develop on a reasonable budget, deliberately limiting fancy graphics to focus solely on gameplay depth. Sadly, this game is a living testimony of a team being too lazy or too tired to make a truly great game.   Maybe they lost faith in this game at some point. No wonder this happened to me too.",0,1

Been playing CS since 2003. Despite what the box on tactical ops says no really it's not better than counter strike. CS is the best first person shooter in my opinion. The reason 1.6 is better than GO or Source is because it's about player skill not graphics. The hit boxes are much better. In order to be a great player you need to know how to execute movement even bunny hop.   Best game ever.,1,0

"I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that.",1,0

"Counter-Strike:  I started playing cs when I was just 4 years old .  Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.  CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. 'Very Addictive Game :p",1,0

For a game to not take serously and just be a ♥♥♥♥ being a noob its quite fun. If you are planning to take it serous i wouldn't recommend this game at this period of time do to the fact of the mass amount of nerds in the game makes it hard to begin as well as the high chance of getting a hacker in the lobby using aimbot or some crap like that. Other than that the killstreaks seem too extreme and that it is pretty easy to get spawned killed. So If you don't give a crap and your playing with a friend and you want to make a some 10 year old no life nerd rage bc you ruin their killstreak by noobtubing then this is the game for you.,1,0

Also, I've heard about there being a keylogger within this game. It's meant to encrypt your keypresses to protect against malicious keyloggers. They may have removed it, because I couldn't find the files the community said were used for it. Better safe then sorry, though, so you should check to make sure it isn't there once you install the game.  Reasons for not reccomending? The training session tried to pull me into the game with a set of boobs. Stop this please, game devs. I had to spend 10 minutes to blow a guy up in the training track. I didn't play the game past that.",0,1

"I wasn't sure if to recommend it or not but in the end this game is a no for me. It is an offline mmorpg structured to farm quest over quest with bland stories and the usual pick this and bring it there. The music is nice, the voice acting too and the graphic is enjoyable to watch with all the light effects of the skills. The pro of this game is the combat and skills that are really well made. The camera is the worst and you can pass by a treasure without even finding it. It is hard to go on with the game and it will probably be one of the few that i will never finish.",0,1

When you want to play some TDM, 25% of the time you will be placed in a hacked lobby and promoted to 10th prestige without your permission (Happened to me). Also because of all the hackers/ the game not being updated, the population of the game is about 500 people, resulting in you playing with the game people from day to day.

"I had this game on the PlayStation3 and it was kinda enjoyable. Ripping and tearing apart innocent citizens and soldiers alike, destroying everything, ellbow-slamming a tank - there will be gore and explosions everywhere. Sounds decent, right?  A little.  Only problem is the controls where a bit clunky (even on the PS3) and I had massive problems focussing and attacking the enemy I actually wanted. Another funbreaker is the fact that you're easily being bounced back, even by small and weak enemies. It's even worse when stronger enemies and helicopters chase you. Sometimes you're feeling like a ball in a pinball machine.  This game has so much potential and with proper implementation this propably would have been the best anti-aggression-game and there is. I mean, you have all those amazing powers! From disguise to running at super speed to hammerfists (lets you smash tanks), clawhands (rips and tears everything apart), whiplash (for taking down distant enemies), superjumping, semi-flying (gliding). You can even throw buses into helicopters and stuff, the list goes on and it's awesome.  But you're almost not able to live it up.  The story is ok and acceptable. The missions are way too hard and not fun at all (I'm not a good gamer, though). In one mission you have to flee. Excuse me? I'm a godlike creature and can destroy a tank with a single blow with my ellbow, why the heck should I flee?  That's boring and uninspiring. It's like getting a Lamborghini in a racing game and the game tells you to drive not faster than 30 miles per hour. Unfortunately, I didn't find any cheats or mods for this game. I think with a little effort like removing all the time based missions and the bouncing this would be just awesome.  If you can get this game for a decent price (it's under 10 dollars mostly, on Humble Bundle even cheaper) and if you do like gore, GO GET IT and happy ripping and tearing bodies apart for a while. I really hope you could do an devastator attack on some people out there who are wasting so much potential. It hurts, especially as a creative person.",1,0

"- Horrible console FOV that feels terrible playing on a monitor three feet away rather than a big TV ten feet away. For the peanut gallery: FOV has nothing to do with the quality of your screen, it's about how much you can see, and has a big effect on whether you get motion sickness playing a game. Most modern 1st person games have adjustable FOV sliders in the options. This doesn't, and the FOV is way too narrow.  - Stupid 'portraits' of a developer in Nazi uniiform hanging up in buildings. This isn't an Easter Egg. It might be if there was *one* in a difficult-to-find room: these are all over bombed-out Berlin, where in the Third Reich pretty much every building would have had a picture of Adolf Hitler. It doesn't feel like a cheeky hidden secret, it feels like smirking, masturbatory game developer BS. It also doesn't help that the person in question is a pudgy neckbeard who doesn't in the slightest resemble the average Nazi officer ubermensch type. Maybe Reinhard Heydrich had a shelf full of panty-flashing anime statuettes above his desk, but he sure didn't look that way: this guy does, and it's a huge immersion breaker.  - Keeps calling Soviets 'Russians'. No, this isn't 'racism', it's historical inaccuracy. The Red Army was composed of troops from all over the USSR, not just Russia. It's like calling anyone from the USA a Texan.  Feels like it was developed by people who've seen lots of movies and never read a book (I guess that's the target audience too - a death spiral of ignorance). I'd like to say 'but hey, it's Call of Duty, whaddya expect', but I can't, because the first CoD game was superb. However, this one comes from the same clowns who gave us the Black Ops series, so it's a lot of Michael Bay-style orange fireball theatre, cliches and general d1ck-wagging.

"What to say about Modern Warfare 2? Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.  Now, you may be asking, 'Why is the multiplayer dead?' The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hickers and children. Hickers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hicker, another five are going to take that persons place.   The game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warfare 1, World at War, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review. Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and 'clean' of hickers and cheaters.  Some examples of hickers in Modern Warfare 2, are people who use:  Wallhickers Aimbots Instant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL Unlocks Hud-Hicking (Yes, it does exist) Instant VAC Ban  The Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in MW2 that are safe.  Please, please, please watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.  I've heard that Search and Destroy games are safe, but the player count is very little in most game types.  If you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small. I wish all of you people luck.  Overall, get it for the spec-ops, and the singleplayer.  Edit: I no longer play MW2. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hicked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.  Stay safe, and play safe...and watch for hickers...  -Cheers  old cod better   0/10 (can I get it any lower??)",0,1
"This game features the following: - A clunky menu - Graphics that were outdated two decades ago - A horrible camera in combat (did the developers EVER play a game?) - Lifeless, dull characters I couldn't care less about - Game design and controls from the mid 90s. The character moves so freakin fast it's ridiculous. And dodging an attack makes the charakter dodge for at least five meters. What were they thinking? - Boring gameplay, in the first 30 minutes you're getting bombarded with cutscenes, pre-rendered cutscenes, text to read, yada here, yada there. This is an open world game I heard. Well, I was extremely annoyed by all the interruptions from NPCs or cutscenes. - All the four races you can chose from share the exact same model, only the skin differs. Now that's really some effort they put in the game. - And so on and so on. I only played it for about half an hour and already was so bored I couldn't progress.  Problem probably is, I do like ES:Oblivion, ES:Skyrim, Witcher 3 and the new Tomb Raider.  After playing this games this game here is beyond playability. I will refund this game.",0,1
"The lack of dedicated servers really hurts the game, if you get into a hacked lobby you'll get VAC banned, plus nobody plays it, if you plan to buy this, please don't; if you are doing it for 'da ztory', just get another shooty game with a good story (may I recommend Bioshock Infinite?).  tl;dr fon't buy this, ever.",0,1

"Some basic tips for the Standard difficulty.  1) Do all the available side quests before advancing the main quests.  2) Do not mix Finesse and Magic trees unless you can find daggers equal to your level. They aren't nearly as common as they should be. Otherwise, you can't handle enough damage and don't kill things quickly enough.  3) Dodging is not as useful as the game claims for two reasons.  3a) Dodge doesn't give you any tactical positioning. In fact, most of the time you end up with your back to an opponent that's already turned to face you, so you end up repeat dodging just to get clear without getting it while they follow you.  3b) Certain bosses are too fast for dodging to be useful. Or they have AoE's that are too large to escape with a dodge. There's also fighting multiple opponents at once. They flank and they knock you off balance long enough to hit you again.  4) Amp your resistances up like your life depends on it. It does.  5) Load up on potions. Your life depends on these too.  If you leave any of these tips out, be prepared for frustration and loud cursing.  Oh, and don't count on the NPC's that sometimes accompany you to be useful. They're not. They can't deal damage worth sneezing at, and some of them spend more time rolling around than stabbing things.  Last Tip: The boss at the Hyperian is multi-stage. Be careful about using Fate Mode on him too early. This is the one that got me so frustrated I uninstalled the game.  Enjoy!",1,0

"Now, what's funny is that I bought this game like 2 years ago, and sadly I have not been able to write a review about it, but I'll say, I remember like back in Elementary school like many years ago, I remember it was titled 'Half-Life: Counter-Strike', and during that time, I was always crazy about Military FPS PC games and had an obsession with them as a kid, and when I saw people playing this game, I had no clue but to think that this was some kind of an 'Army Game' like many other, but until I delved deeper watching people play it, I finally came to realize that this was not some kind of an 'Army Game' where you go on missions and do your thing, but turns out that it was some kind of an online shooter where you do the mission with other online players around the world, but when I began to finally get to play it back in my old elementary school years, I would still recognize it as an 'Online Army Game'.",1,0

"i only bought this for zombies. i hate cod. this one is one of the worst despite what fanboys might say. like all cod games the mp is uninspired, and more of luck/spray and pray based than any kind of skill oriented shooter. the single player is plauged by HUGE issues that should have dissapeared years ago, constantly respawning enemies until you reach a certain point, enemies spawning out of mid air (ive come into rooms only to be confronted by a lmg popping into existance out of nowhere in front of me, and the squad ai serves as only a distraction to the equally ♥♥♥♥ enemies. your squad seems unable to kill targets 3 feet in front of them and they constantly tell you to move up and complete tasks without any kind of covering fire etc. it breaks immersion and comes across as just plain stupid. hey you go shoot 3 tanks with an rpg while being nade spammed and rushed by enemies while we sit behind cover and let u do all the work! its uninspired and LAZY. its artifical difficulty. games are supposed to be harder based on clever design not constant nades every 2-3 second and useless ai that gets in ur way when you try to run away. ive been killed more times from being blocked by my squad than by making mistakes. its broken and stale. which is really dissapointing considering the interesting setting. i cant see why anyone would like this game when there are much better cleverly crafted shooters on the market that dont use nade spam as a crutch for difficulty. return to castle wolfenstien is a good example of a shooter done right. if u can get it on sale for the zombies mode it can be worth it as mods can make it its own game alone, however the base game (what the game is meant to be) is a 5/10 at best. poor design does not =good difficulty . ive been playing shooters my entire life and am a smfc in counterstrike. skill is not an issue. give this one a pass unless you like zombie mode, there are much better options, that are much more worth the money.",0,1

This is not a good game, its decent at best.    It has alot of problem; boring unclear story, generic shooting, awful vehicle control and one of the worst multiplayer mode I've ever played.

The 2D and Pseudo 3D aspects of Disciples II, I loved every bit of it so F…ck very much for ruining it.  I don’t like the artwork, also the interactive objects in the game world are hardly identifiable, yes it takes some getting used to however the game lost all the Disciples appeal that attracted me in the first place.

"Counter-strike, my childhood! Brings bad memories back...  One of the first Valve games, and this one is a total ♥♥♥♥. I understand why Half-life sucks so much, but how famous multiplayer trash shooter can be so badly made?! There is two teams, terrorist team and counter-terrorist team (both acts like scumbags). Your goal is to kill other team or place the bomb as terrorist. Allahu akbar! Never seen this before, bad guys can actually win. Its terrorism propaganda! Counter-strike playerbase is worst part of this, they dumb as ♥♥♥♥ and hot headed of course, alot of cheaters who cant play fair, this makes this game completely unplayable and innocent people get VAC ban (like me). Valve dont want to take responsibilty, they want to have fun with their ♥♥♥♥ing Steam money and spit on us! There is only one official game mode, kill each other and take score. Pfff, we need more!

"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.  Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.  Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.",1,0

"The story is uninspired and the main character is as bland as stale toast. The camera and the targetting are on the same stick so you will constantly find yourself in situations where you have to choose between panning the camera or getting a lock on something - only to have that target switch to yet another unlabeled target whether you have line of sight or not. You'll be ragdolled out of maneuvers constantly. This includes 'consuming' people to restore your health. This means you'll grab someone, start to eat them and have the animation interrupted by one of the dozen (at least) incoming attacks. Maybe it's a bulky melee hunter, maybe it's splash damage from the thirty-five missles and tank rounds, doesn't matter. Trying to restore health anywhere near an active battle (and the battle will follow you around corners, onto rooftops, and also see through your disguise instantly once the Super Soldiers enter the fight) is literally setting yourself up to be mauled. I'm lead to believe the studio that created this piece of ♥♥♥♥ went out of business. With the design decisions they made here I have to say everyone who plays videogames is better off.",0,1

It won't be time-travelling kung fu out there, but just spamming Time Stop once in 7 seconds to insta-regen health and continue dodging tons of bullets.  Cool fighting? No. Grab the most overpowered guns in game and hope nobody shpongles charged plasma in your backside.  Cool graphics? Oh well, 2.5 out of 5. Backgrounds and levels are nice and linear, NPC are ugly, and you never see yourself in game. Even hands.  Cool storyline? Err... well, they explained basically nothing. HInts don't tie up into solid story, and there wasn't a solid story to begin with. Even motives and build-up are missing.  Cool multiplayer? Go get Unreal Tournament and forget this, srsly.  Cool cinematics? Yes, 5 seconds each. But hey! - we'll get a nude female once in a while there! Worth it!

UPDATE: tried playing some more. Still a mediocre game. Thumbs down.  Amazing how bad, clumsy, and sluggish the combat is. It's like playing an old NES 64 game. So bad.",0,1
"The controls. The controls man, they suck balls.  I played with an XBOX360 controller and then a mouse, neither of which did much to allieviate the problem of that slow, clunky camera and hyperspeed movement of your character. I fiddled with the settings but alas there was no way to get him to slow down and to get the camera to be responsive enough. It wasn't an issue with my hardware, as the game itself ran perfectly. My pc is fairly average, but still the game ran a solid 55-60fps.  The opening is very drab and dull, you're fateless do you don't die forever and now you have to something something well of souls I don't know. I honestly tried to keep up with the story and plot but it was just so generic.  The combat leaves much to be desired. There is no lock on that you control, the game decides when you are targeting an enemy all by itself. This functioned well enough, but I was really wanting a dedicated button to be able to break and change my target. The combat is tremendously slow and clunky. There is little to no skill required for bows, the daggers are overpowered and the magic is the most meh magic I've ever cast.  Now, granted I only just left the tutorial cave after the Troll fight, but I could not bring myself to play on. I was just constantly thinking 'This isn't fun, I have at least five other games on steam I bought in the sales that I could be playing right now.'  I do no recommend this game because the controls are absurd, some of the worst I've ever encountered (and I played Dark Souls with the mouse for a session), the setting and story is bland and the combat is lacking. How this game gets high scores and recommendations anywhere is beyond me. I even had my friend who had played the ps3 version take the controls and he said it felt very different. If you really want this game, get it on ps3.  If you still really want this game on pc, €5 is what I paid for it and I'm glad I didn't spend any more than that.",0,1

"The Call of Duty franchise was great until this game came out, where do i begin...  Pros:  Historical accuracy and information is much more than the previous games.  You get to play as an American captive in the Pacific Theatre, which was never done in the previous two games  You can throw a activated grenade back at the enemy if you are quick enough.  On that note, you get far less ammo than the previous two games, making the game more realistic  You can reload the M1 Grand without having to deplete the entire clip.  Cons:  The voice acting is disgusting. It sounds like it was tacked on as an afterthought rather than integrated into the actual game. It sounds like Treyarch hired the actors from b-reel movies.  The cinematics don't show a lot of game play, They are also too 'active' and they do not give us enough time to let us understand what we are supposed to learn from the Pacific Theatre, for example.  The FOV is horrendous, and while there is mod support, a game this advanced should have come standard with an FOV Slider.  The sound quality in general is not of the same fidelity as it was in the previous two games. Granted the engine is more 'advanced,' I liked the clip ejection 'ping' from the M1 Grand from the previous two games.  Conclusion:  I am thankful I got this was a part of the CoD War Chest bundle over Christmas 2015 rather than full price. This game is not worth your money since it takes so many steps back and tries to become an interactive movie instead. Very disappointed by the quality of this game overall. At least it looks pretty.",0,1

"Short version: Ok singleplayer for $10. Not recommending cos the normal tag is (at least in AUS) $40 USD. Play time 8hrs 40min on Veteran (frist run)  Long version: Standard shooter. Still not as good as original COD. Stole a lot of it's missions from the original  (e.g. Reichstadt, Stalingrad). Gunning down civilians was a plus.  The difficulty of enemies is lame, brought on by implementing a simple AI that autoaims/wallhacks, funneled scripted moments, and overwhelming number of enemies. Nothing tactical or strategic required.  Weird autosave spots, like right in the middle of a firefight. Then not one for 5 minutes. Visual cues when and where you are getting hit from are poor. Screen shakes a lot for no reason (getting hit, heavy vehicle) Garbage stealth level where you kill one guy silently and suddenyl everyone knows. Unless if your sniper buddy kills him, then that's ok. Spawns enemies right on top of you, in corners where you know there were no enemies.  Can't tell who are the enemy, yet get a game over screen for shooting your buddies No continuity between one level and the next.  Some nice level design - felt that although scenarios were repeated ad infinitum - some of those levels lacked character, while others were detailed. Only allowed to complete everything one way (with a handful out of thousands of potential choices, with zero consequence).  Hold button until it dies works in 95% of cases Your allies do next to nothing unless explicitly scrtiped to do so... might as well be Star Wars Stormtroopers.  I feel there was a much better story here that someone sold out just to get it published. There were heaps of tiny details that were present just not utilised. Pity.",0,1

I'm playing in this game since 2000! (CS Beta 7.1) It's my 1st favorite game!,1,0
"Dead Mountaineer's Hotel is a game based on the novel of the same name by the Strugatsky brothers, the generally pretty great Russian sci-fi authors who also wrote books like Roadside Picnic, which was the basis of the movie which was in turn the basis of the STALKER series. I've never read this particular book, but I figured anything related to them couldn't possibly turn out that bad. I was horribly wrong, but I don't need to tell you that, because I doubt anyone was actually planning on buying this game to begin with. But I'm going to go over it anyways because I need a therapeutic rant session to recover from playing it.  The first thing you'll notice within five seconds of starting the game is that the voice acting is absolutely terrible. Just listen to the opening dialogue of the game, and you'll see what I mean:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRYvubs4MQs  . Well, actually the first thing you'll notice is that despite originally releasing in 2007 the game only runs in one resolution, and it's 1024 x 768 and cannot be changed, but still. There are one or two actors who border on decent, but for the most part the game sounds as if they hired a bunch of bums off the street and paid them in bread to do the voice acting for the game. It's kind of hilarious, and was mainly what kept me playing through the game, but it also made the story impossible to take seriously.  Luckily, there really isn't much story. Again, I've never read the novel this was based off of, but I highly doubt it went quite like this. You spent the first four or five hours of the game doing absolutely nothing relevant to the plot, mainly involving stupid puzzles like helping the hotel owner fix the room service call system that never gets used again, or choosing a dinner from various categories that doesn't cause the other guests to laugh at your choice (I don't know why having too many vegetables in your meal is grounds for making you redo a 'puzzle', but what do I know?), or playing billiards with another character that isn't even really a puzzle so much as just a billiards flash game implanted into the game. Then in the last 20 minutes or so of the game the story finally starts, you talk to each of the hotel's residents, and then it ends, and the game explains the story to you.   As you might have gathered from that last bit, the store page is pretty misleading. It mentions '15+ hours of gameplay', but I finished it in less than 6 and I can't imagine it taking 15 hours unless you just get lost in the unnecessarily large hotel. The store page also makes it seem as if the hotel guests have AI routines and go about their own lives, hinting at a system something like how Deadly Premonition's characters go about their day, but the game doesn't have any sort of time system and the characters just move from place to place as you solve the puzzles like in any adventure game. I used to think RunAway was the worst point-and-click adventure game I'd ever played, but I'm not sure if anything will ever top this one.",1,0

"'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.' A review by Richard Valkinsenn.  EDIT: My original review of Modern Warfare 2 has been updated to reflect my changed opinion of the game. I have a lot to say about it, and not a lot of it's good. The review is now broken up into two sections and will cover the game's campaign and multiplayer suites, respectively.  ---- CAMPAIGN REVIEW ----  Modern Warfare 2 is the pinnacle of the Call of Duty series, second only to it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. Unfortunately, factoring in both the game's single-player and multiplayer suites, that's not really saying much. Campaign-wise, admittedly, Modern Warfare 2's campaign does feature a thrilling, well-acted campaign, and comes packed with thrills and chills, the latter of which is mostly contained in the campaign's notorious 'No Russian' mission. While the campaign's level design is linear, thankfully the player is given a wide variety of roles throughout the game's runtime. One level will feature a tense series of firefights with loads of enemies while another will have the player moving stealthily in a semi-linear fashion from point A to point B. As for long-lasting appeal, somehow, Modern Warfare 2 has a charm that has withstood the test of time.  The campaign also features a co-op mode featuring missions based on scenarios seen not just in Modern Warfare 2 but also it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. These missions are widely varied and feature time attacks, stealth missions, and other various modes for up to two players to engage in. There are a few missions which require no less than two players, but thankfully, the majority of the missions can be completed solo, if players so desire.  Sadly, while the campaign and co-op modes are pretty solid, as far as a PC port goes, the entire package as a whole is found wanting. For starters, the game's options lack many essential PC features, like a Field of View (FOV) slider. In fact, it seems the developers went out of the way to make it difficult to even edit the native FOV via console or cfg edits. Not to mention the fact that the lack of separated audio sliders makes trying to tailor the game's audio experience to one's liking impossible. What makes it even worse is the lack of mod support, meaning basically that making custom content for the game is something that's just not gonna happen. Above all else, what makes it all even worse is the game's multiplayer suite, which only serves to highlight many of the game's glaring faults.  Campaign Verdict: I liked it.  ---- MULTIPLAYER REVIEW ----  Years ago, I played Modern Warfare 2 on Xbox LIVE and rather enjoyed it. However, having transitioned to the PC in the last several years and having played other, superior online titles, I've found Modern Warfare 2's PC multiplayer suite to be nothing short of a train wreck.  In addition to the glaring lack of an FOV slider, so much power and choice was taken out of the player's hands in this game. Dedicated servers, or at least a server browser for choosing matches is non-existent. Voting to kick or ban problematic players was left out. Mod support for custom content is gone. A much-needed feature like hiding the in-game chat log is just not there. And sure you could host a private match, but hosting a public match with custom rules and map rotations is a thing of the past. Well, unless you hack it in, but then you run the risk of getting hit with a Valve Anti-Cheat ban.  Then you get to the actual gameplay that Modern Warfare 2 has to offer... and it gets a little better and a lot worse from there. While MW2's maps are thankfully not as restrictive as later titles in the overall series, they still suffer from a near-complete lack of interactivity. Not everything about the maps is terrible, however, as they do allow for a multitude of different tactics and approaches, though this also applies to hiding spots and long, open stretches for campers to exploit. As far as the game's arsenal and perks go, there's a lot of room for mixing and matching to create a lot of different approaches and playstyles. At the same time, weapon customization is sadly hampered by the fact that only one attachment is allowed at a time, though a certain perk can allow up to two. However, adding this perk to a loadout means that no other perks in that perk's category can be applied.  Above all else, there's one thing that makes Modern Warfare 2 just about unbearable at any time, and it's an issue that also extends to the entire series, overall. A lot of the methods for getting kills in Modern Warfare 2 require little to no skill to employ. An example would be the addition of quick, one-hit knife kills that can be require little more than a button press, in addition to lethal traps that can be laid for other players. Several of the game's perks also exacerbate this, like a perk that expands the lethal radius for explosives or another that increases the distance over which knife kills apply. Not to mention the fact that the game doesn't treat fired shots like projectiles; once the sights are lined up, bullet hits are instantly guaranteed, no matter the distance.  Overall, while it has many high points, Modern Warfare 2 on the PC leaves way too much to be desired. A glaring lack of much-needed PC features along with an array of lackluster gameplay features sours an online and even offline experience with lots of untapped potential.  Multiplayer Verdict: It could've been much better.",1,0

"i have not played this one for i was always a fan of world at war and black ops. but this one was said to be the best before the third game. well truth is i can tell it used to be but not now. this game is infected with hackers, aimbots, map hackers, speed hackers, you name it and you can find it. oh did i mention that out of the constant 300+ people there most of them are hackers? ya see i can tell this cause of the severe landslide of 10th prestige level 70 players with prestige emblems/rank emblems you cant get unless you mod or hack or have a hacker give to you. i was level 24 when this happened but i joined a server via random matchmaking que and it put me in a server that was really laggy. then after about a minute a player on the console with a rainbow colored name said ' everyone gets level 70 ' then a loading bar popped up on my screen that looked like it was a campaign hud overlay for a mission done in campaign counting percents. well in my console it was telling me all my challenges were being completed one by one and one after another. i tried to leave the server but it had been too late. the hacker had made my once FAIR level 24 profile a level 70 profile with hacked emblems titles and such. being really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off as i was i refused to play for a day then said 'might as well just try to enjoy the game' well among servers like that and other exploits i was also thrown into countless matches where people were running mods such as changing the team names of navy seals and the spetsnaz to '♥♥♥♥♥' and '♥♥♥♥♥'s' as well as turning off everyones loadouts killstreaks knife button aim button and replaced grenades with throwing knives and forced to no scope with a intervention. then there was another server where one such hacker was calling every single kill streak reward in the game all at once within the first ten seconds of the match. another server i joined changed the map half way through. and to further prove my point. there is a server that someone is running labeled as a team death match server but its a team domination server. the host of such server is running a aimbot with a 50 cal and every time he takes a shot every lags. as well as he has turned off various loudouts and changed what is in them. i dont think this game is bad persay. but it is infested with hackers and Infinity ward and Valve's VAC service that is supposed to maintain the game is doing absolutly nothing about such problems. i would say get this game because its a good game in the series but unfortunately i wouldnt even look in its general direction unless its playing privately with a friend or two. ( if anyone will play it due to call of duty's reputation. i for one have only few people i know who play it on my friends list cause of the fad of people saying cod sucks cause it sucks nonsense) if anyone were to get this game i implore you to not even touch the multiplayer functions unless playing privitely with a friend. other than that this game is dead because of infinity wards abandonment of it as well as the VAC service being proved to be really useless in it.

Sadly, for all its attempts to sound cool with its '3D' and its 'ultra' it's actually pretty boring and pretty tame.

"The Call of Duty franchise was great until this game came out, where do i begin...  Pros:  Historical accuracy and information is much more than the previous games.  You get to play as an American captive in the Pacific Theatre, which was never done in the previous two games  You can throw a activated grenade back at the enemy if you are quick enough.  On that note, you get far less ammo than the previous two games, making the game more realistic  You can reload the M1 Grand without having to deplete the entire clip.  Cons:  The voice acting is disgusting. It sounds like it was tacked on as an afterthought rather than integrated into the actual game. It sounds like Treyarch hired the actors from b-reel movies.  The cinematics don't show a lot of game play, They are also too 'active' and they do not give us enough time to let us understand what we are supposed to learn from the Pacific Theatre, for example.  The FOV is horrendous, and while there is mod support, a game this advanced should have come standard with an FOV Slider.  The sound quality in general is not of the same fidelity as it was in the previous two games. Granted the engine is more 'advanced,' I liked the clip ejection 'ping' from the M1 Grand from the previous two games.  Conclusion:  I am thankful I got this was a part of the CoD War Chest bundle over Christmas 2015 rather than full price. This game is not worth your money since it takes so many steps back and tries to become an interactive movie instead. Very disappointed by the quality of this game overall. At least it looks pretty.",0,1
"-Love to shoot people with real life guns with different names? -Have you ever dreamed to kill terrorists and even be a terrorist? -Love playing the same, universal map over and over just because it's the only map you'll ever know? (*cough* dust2) -Have you a desire to work as a team to complete objectives? -Do you know how to speak Brazilian-Portuguese and Romanian? (Awesome because many servers have players that have Brazilians, Romanians, and many other South American/Eurpoean players) -Love nostalgia? -Love to have fun? -Love getting an extra game with bots in it for free?  -Love randomly dying from wallbangs?  Great, you've come to the right game. Seriously though, despite the somewhat smaller North American community (Which is still big for the old game it is) it's probably one of the greatest games i've ever come to play, and i've only had it for about a year, and i'm gonna add hundreds of thousands of hours playing this. I don't even have actual friends that play with me yet I can still have fun with this game. From the countless recoil patterns to remember from all the guns, to the extremely friendly community (for the most part) and playing all these classic maps. Yes, of course there's hackers, you'll see a few of them, but they don't ruin the game. Either the server's admin can just ban them or you can just go to a different server, it's not gamebreaking or anything. And besides, if you get this you also get Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, which has bots. Hell, you can even download Zbots for 1.6, and it waypoints for you! Definitely get this game. This game stands the test of time.  10/10 Would throw brick-looking grenades at terrorists again.",1,0

Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.  Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.    [The legendary FPS, till this day its still being played quite actively, 'old but gold' is the only thing that applies here.

"- Found it hard to play with the current camera setup, couldnt zoom out any further(or at least find a way to do so) and this ruined the game for me. - mediocre gfx even for 2012, pretty sure my galaxy s4 can do better. - Tried to like it and pushed through to the 1st town but after receiving multiple random quests pretty much from nowhere i found that the whole feel of the game was underwhelming and a little outdated. - Unsure of all the reviews giving it awesome scores etc, as this was not the case for me. - If your looking for that game of all games, then i would suggest looking elsewhere as this is no ground breaker.",0,1
"This game was the best one out there, but not anymore. (Because of the players online)  If you want to play Free For All or something like that, tough ♥♥♥♥ nobody plays that anymore.  If you want to play Zombies, you won't get very far at all, people play it, but all of them are stubborn, picky, pieces of ♥♥♥♥, if you do not meet their expectations you will be instantly kicked, or the host will end the session. Same goes with if you host a lobby, the same stubborn picky pieces of ♥♥♥♥♥ will leave immediately.  A thing I noticed is that if no one hacks in the lobby, the lobby will end because the hosts just want hacks, little 10 year olds only play the game to 'hack'  So basically the game is so dead to the point where people no longer want to play the game how it is, they want to play a modded version of it, and that if you don't hack, you're too low and you'll be kicked.

" After 14 years of existence, this legendary game is still in the Steam top 10 most played multiplayers in the world .   While earning tons of money based on Counter-Strike sales, Valve shows its appreciation to the players that bought the game by still not maintaining it and treating it like it doesn't even exist. Even more, starting with February 2013, Valve has released a couple of minor updates for Counter-Strike which intentionally created problems for the game(suddenly stopping afterwards) so that the players would be forced to migrate to and buy CS:GO(which currently has and most probably will keep having major problems like fps drops and hit misdetection - problem present on all Source engine based multiplayers since 2004).  Congratulations, Valve .    Counting the players that migrated to or play the non-Steam version of Counter-Strike, the game still easily classifies itself even today in the top 5 most played multiplayers in the world .",1,0

"It's the year 2015. This game was made in 2000. 15 years is alot in terms of technological advnaces. You only need to look at the break throughs, inventions and so on to know this. So i'm bought back to my original question why do so many people,play thos game now, the graphocs look terroble as they would seeing as it was 15 years ago and so on. I would assume becaise it is because of how succesful amd popular the counter strike franchise is. But they mechanics, movement,graphocs and many more wouldn't be good in today's 2015 gaming standards. Do u just play it to try amd revive the good old times or to simply run away from children?",1,0

"Purchased this game after reading about who was involved in its creation. Left it in my library for a while and wasn't motivated to install or play it. I finally got around to it!  Firstly, the world is huge! There are many places to explore if you're into that. Secondly, there are a lot of quests to gather. So far I have not seen any consequences to the decisions your hero makes. The story doesn't seem to be too much about the hero, but those around the hero, which, in my opinion, caused me to disassociate with my toon. I didn't feel particularly important. I mostly felt like some lackey who needed to fetch this or go slay that.  The audio of the game bothered me a bit, particularly the character speech. In a lot of instances I could barely hear the NPCs speak and had to rely on subtitles to know what's going on. I looked for an adjustment that catered to headphones (if that was the problem) but found no such option in the menu. I understand that the sounds should be directional (ie the dialogue should sound softer when camera is turned away from the NPC), but this occurs in cutscenes as well and I found it annoying that I could not hear the voice actors.  The camera action in the game is also a bit wonky. In some situations the camera just...leaves you, as if you dropped it and you watch your toon run away. The sensitivity of camera movement, if you're using a mouse to look around, is way too sensitive. A light movement from the mouse could swing the camera really fast at odd angles. That sort of thing made combat a little frustrating for me, where one second I am charging at my target and the next I'm looking at the wrong direction.  All in all, it's a beautiful game with a LOT to do and has a deep customization factor for your hero, but those little problems I noted above just takes the immersion experience away from me. To be able to be immersed into the world and its lore is why I like RPGs in the first place.",1,0

"Alliance of Valiant Arms is an example of a Pay2Win game. By spending an average amount, you get so much stuff, it will easily over-power anyone who has payed nothing. The sniper rifles are extremely cheap. When using a sniper rifle, once a shot is fired, you can switch to another weapon and then switch back by quickly hitting the q button twice, its like an OP DMR that can one shot anyone under any circumstances. It takes too much time to rank up, and you cannot purchase anything until Rank 8. This will have you stuck with default items for ages. And the ONE thing that made me quit this game is none other than the god forsaken time trails!!! They suck, they are impractical, and just ruins your day when all of your weapons suddenly dissapear. Otherwise, the game is decent in every other perspective. The graphics are nice, controls are smooth, maps and gamemodes are acceptable and even unique in some cases, like Escape (Though Zombie modes suck). Without those, the only thing it has running for it is that its not Combat Arms.",1,0

"This game is complete ♥♥♥♥. I 0nly downloaded it for the black rose item in tf2, and even then I regret it. It looks like crap, with muggy textures and uninspired environments. Not to mention the bugs, jesus christ the bugs. The game will crash constantly, and will just flat out NOT WORK. I was on the tutorial, I had to break some boxes with a knife. Broke a few, saw a ladder and climbed it. The game stopped and was like 'Oh, you didn't break every single box. Go back and do that.' Broke the ONE SINGULAR box I left, and then the NPC guide for the tutorial took a step in front of me and was like 'Oh, you don't know how ladders work, so let me show you.' She then proceeded to get stuck on the ladder and I had to restart the tutorial. ♥♥♥♥ this game. EDIT: Also, this is teenage boy bait. LOOK! GUNS! MILLITARY! What? Women in the millitary?

"I tried to get into it, I really did, but it just feels... wrong. I've heard before that Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning was a failed attempt at an MMO and I'm afraid it shows. Between monsters constantly spawning up and quests being largely inconsequential I can't help but feel I'm playing a single player MMO. The combat is obviously what is going to bring in most people and it is entertaining but it gets really old really quick. As if that isn't bad enough the level up system follows that bad system that keeps getting thrown around where you only buff up a few things by a couple percents for every point *cough*Borderlands*cough*. I don't give a damn if I now have 3% to crit as opposed to 2.5%, I want to feel like that 1 point can completely change my character. Instead of busting out an abacus to figure out which percent is better to raise I should be able to tilt my head back and ask myself 'How do I wanna ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up today?'.  tl;dr it's a failed attempt at an rpg, give it a pass unless it's on a huge sale and the combat really grabs you",0,1

"I love Postal 2! And I loved the humor and story of Postal 3. The only thing why I dont recommend this is the lackluster gameplay and the several technical Issues.  Pros:  + its Postal through and through, Sex , Violence, Racism, Animal Abuse and tons of other stuff that made this franchise famous + the story is pretty funny + many new and old weapons to choose from + a new city to explore + some celebrity characters + great sense of humor and satire + multiple paths to choose from, that actually change things up   Cons:  - on a technical side the game is a complete mess. So many bugs,glitches and crashes, I will point out the worst one by one - a bug caused one of my save games to crash on being loaded.....that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off so much since I was far into the game - ALL the mlee weapons are absolutley useless.....you cant hit anything because they are so extremley poorly programmed - hit detection is a absurd - 3rd person view is pointless and even worse can trigger bugs and camera glitches.......why not stick with first person? This is a major downer! - ranged weapons feel way off when aiming, you can hit your targets but it just feels so bad to aim - gasoline is buggy and doesnt work like in postal 2, you cant pour it onto people anymore, they have to walk on the ground you´re pouring at (like I said, many special weapons are buggy) - way too many missions stick to the same formular - horde shooter where you have to take out certain people - many random crashes - you cant mount a cat on a gun -_- seriously whos decision was it to remove this feature? Its like one of the most iconic things in Postal 2! - the explorable city is pretty small, there isnt much to actually do, I expected some kind of funny mini games, there are funny arcade cabins, but they are only cosmetic.....how disappointing - the enemy AI is none-existent.......they are so incredibly incompetent at doing anything - and like I said....many many bugs in missions and scripted events  Oh Postal.....I loved the second one, and the humor and one liners are back....but with such a horrible gameplay mechanics thats its barely playable. I played through the good campaign and it crashed too much on the bad campaign and I deinstalled in rage.

Buuut, the units are imbalanced which is topped by a fiendish in-game interface and bugged scripts which render the some missions incompletable.

At best, this game is slightly below average. At worst, it's a disgusting mash-up of CS gameplay with F2P money-begging.",0,1

Best Game All-Time c: #Oldschool 2000 ^^,1,0
It looks fun doesn't it? yeah thats what I thought too. But that was before I got it.   The concept of being able to attack yourself and use towers is nice and when executed properly works well. Orcs Must Die did not execute it well. Its problem is that if you don't attack you fail and on most every map there are 2 points the orcs come from and there are not 2 of you so you kill 1 side while the other gets through then you go to push back the other side meanwhile the side you were protecting gets up and then your at the very end of the map trying to shoot 2 ways at 1 time and it doesn't work. The only tower to make your enemys stop (at least as far as I played) is not even a tower its a KILLABLE Paladin. So unless you make like 3 of those at each side they all die. Even with 3 they die. Even with lots of support from ranged towers they die. Without using them the enemys move too fast and your towers can't hit them for long enough to kill them and you die.  Another big problem is that they tryed to make too many towers. You get a tower after each level and they were probably running out of ideas and were just making stupid things. What I really don't like is that 90% of the towers have almost no difference except look or wether its on the wall or the floor or the ceiling. And alot of them just push the orcs so they are only usefull in certain levels where they can push the orcs off the level. Also the ceiling mounted ones alot are useless because the level will have too high ceilings and they won't hit anything.  It was fun for the first 8ish levels but overall I give it a 5/10. I would recommend you go buy Sanctum 2,0,1

Another sequel in the Call of Duty franchise. Not only is this game now very old it is also the bloody same as every other Call of Duty.Hey atleast they had half the decency and didnt reuse all of it right?

"The old iPhone game  Sword &amp; Poker 2  (NOT the awful freemium remake!) does everything right that Runespell does wrong.  In S&amp;P2, your spells directly affect the poker grid, which allows you to make better, deadlier poker hands. Which is fun. In Runespell, the spells do NOT let me affect the solitaire/poker game. They just let end it faster.  In S&amp;P2, you actually feel like you're playing (a weird variant of) poker. In Runespell, the game is much closer to Klondike solitaire. (Fairway Solitaire was fun, but this isn't.)  In S&amp;P2, the story is 'Go poker cute monsters to death to save the world... again' In Runespell, there's this ridiculous grimdark story because you fight everyone with solitaire and poker's UGLY child.  In S&amp;P2, you have incentive to not just defeat the enemy, but to do  well  - you only get a few healing potions per level, so the better you fight, the more health you'll have in the next battle. In Runespell, you heal fully between every fight so who cares as long as you win.",1,0

"DON'T FALL FOR NOSTALGIA BIAS  Pros: -classic feel  -people still play it(barely) -no skins(almost)  Cons: -80% of the players are hackers and do not speak english(so no real teamwork) -real servers with the gamemode actually being a CS type are almost non-existant -actual enjoyability comes from whether or not you like to deal with the above  This is one of gamings most treasered games and it is sad to see it get like this. Nostalgia can only get people so far and it is a shame thaat few people explain the reality of this game in their reviews. The fun is not totally gone, although it is something you have to really try to find. The gameplay is as you would expect it (at least when you find a server that doesn't have CSGO surfers on it), nothing has changed and thats good. The problem is the community. It is hard to find a server with a team you can communicate with because of the major language barrier the game now has.  Communication is key in this game as you would expect, and it is very rare because almost everytime you get on a server it is from a central american area and the players mostly speak spanish. Making it difficult as you would expect.   The amount of hacking in this game shameful, it is more common than it is in CSGO and is a real problem that makes the experience more bad than it already has become.  The server types are just like what you would see in an old game, modded to hell with new terribly unenjoyable game modes. If you were to see you would find many gameplay modded servers that give you trash that nobody wants to see (surfing).   Take away the nostalgia bias that everyone tosses out and you will see that this game is a former shell of itself. It has all the elements of a typical old PC game that only a few people will try hard enough to enjoy. The enjoyment can still be found, but at a heavy heavy cost. RIP CS1.",1,0

"Ok, so Kingdoms of Amalur. After watching the trailer when it was on sale, and looking up some reviews, I decided to buy it. Straight off the bat, I came across my first problem. When the game was done downloading, I counldnt see anything. I can hear the audio just fine, but the visuals didnt show. (and no its not my graphics card, it can easily handle it [Amd A10-5745M Apu with Radeon]) So i deleted it and reinstalled it. It worked so i continued to play. After the turtorial, I agreed with most if not all players that the combat is EXTREMELY FUN. I was somewhat bewildered and happy with this new combat mechanic. But the fun combat cannot cover the other complaints I have. First off, the characters are really boring. Not just the npcs, but your player as well. Though a somewhat interseting backstory, it doesnt grip me enough to play on. Same with the plot. The unintersting story, just doesnt flow well.(Dont worry about spoliers, beacuse i dont even know whats the plot) Maybe its due to the fact that Ive only played the game for 3 hours, and it picks up later on, but if it does, then thats a fail for a rpg. Or any game for that matter. These flaws already is a turn down for me. Fighting makes only half of an rpg, and story and character devlopment as the other(where this game fails to achive). There are a couple of minor flaws, but I think its more of a play style prefernce. So my verdict:5/10. A decent rpg with an extremely fun fighting mechanic, but lacks in essensial rpg elements. If this were a free game, i wouldve cared less, and probably wouldve given it a positive review, but if Im BUYING an rpg game, I EXPECT an rpg game.",0,1

"A lot like CoD4.   The campaign is fine, but the multiplayer has hackers, which ruins the game. The multiplayer maps you start out with make poor use of space, and unlike in CoD4, where small maps had room for all ranges of weapons, pretty much everyone in MW2 uses medium range weapons. So less diversity, still hackers, but the game doesn't have all the mods that made CoD4 interesting, plus no admins.  Just not worth it.",0,1

"I had tons of fun with this game at one point, as you can probably tell by my hours played in Multiplayer. There's no denying it's quite a fun game, well, was a fun game.   In it's current state (referring to the online) it isn't worth buying. There aren't as many people playing anymore, and you'll probably get caught up in the same two or three lobbies, half of which are modded.   By the off chance you land yourself in a fresh lobby with no hackers, then you'll still have to deal with an FOV locked at 65, which for many people is just absurd. (You can find a third party launcher than changes the FOV without getting banned by IW, that's what I used for a while).   At one point this game was teeming with competative, fair players. It used to be one of the only COD games, besides CoD4, with a decent community. Unfortunately, the game now houses boatloads of hackers, modded lobbies, and little incentive to keep playing.  Anyway, great game if you have the patience to ignore these major flaws, but I cannot recommend it anymore in it's current state.",0,1
"First impressions were not positive.  -World of Warcraft is a strong influence. The narrative, visuals &amp; voice acting are boilerplate. If you've played WoW you already know how the story will be told and what it will look &amp; sound like, right down to the elves &amp; gnomes.  -The combat system is derived from God of War, perhaps? It works well for melee combat, but casting and archery are relegated to auto-targeting and feel dull.   -All player characters are male.  -The menus are awkward; lots of decending and ascending through menu-after-sub-menu with little aesthetic flare.   -The much maligned quick-time event also makes an appearance. I ignored it, but my character still produced a gigantic spear of pure light which he proceeded to plunge through his adversary' s face.",0,1

"Most people remember this game as the last good Call Of Duty Game. The multiplayer is good, but you should probably buy this on console. The multiplayer is entirely plagued with hackers. The neglect from Infinity Ward and hacking has gotten so bad to the point where hackers can ruin your game, and since Steam cloud saves your data, it's impossible to fix in some cases. There's no word from Steam when the community asks for soloutions.  There are groups of legit players who play private matches, if you can find one, it's fun, but that's more of a tactic to avoid hackers for people who already have the game.  Some of the things hackers can do is change your resoloution, your minimap size (to the point where it takes up the whole screen.) These problems can be fixed by deleting you config files and verifying your cache. They can also corrupt your rank, and this can't be fixed, unless you get into another hacked lobby and they rank you up to 70.  This is a GOOD multiplayer game, but I'm going to thumb it down because of how prevelent hackers are, and people should know about. Unless you already have people to play with, I wouldn't buy it for PC.",0,1

"Short version: Ok singleplayer for $10. Not recommending cos the normal tag is (at least in AUS) $40 USD. Play time 8hrs 40min on Veteran (frist run)  Long version: Standard shooter. Still not as good as original COD. Stole a lot of it's missions from the original  (e.g. Reichstadt, Stalingrad). Gunning down civilians was a plus.  The difficulty of enemies is lame, brought on by implementing a simple AI that autoaims/wallhacks, funneled scripted moments, and overwhelming number of enemies. Nothing tactical or strategic required.  Weird autosave spots, like right in the middle of a firefight. Then not one for 5 minutes. Visual cues when and where you are getting hit from are poor. Screen shakes a lot for no reason (getting hit, heavy vehicle) Garbage stealth level where you kill one guy silently and suddenyl everyone knows. Unless if your sniper buddy kills him, then that's ok. Spawns enemies right on top of you, in corners where you know there were no enemies.  Can't tell who are the enemy, yet get a game over screen for shooting your buddies No continuity between one level and the next.  Some nice level design - felt that although scenarios were repeated ad infinitum - some of those levels lacked character, while others were detailed. Only allowed to complete everything one way (with a handful out of thousands of potential choices, with zero consequence).  Hold button until it dies works in 95% of cases Your allies do next to nothing unless explicitly scrtiped to do so... might as well be Star Wars Stormtroopers.  I feel there was a much better story here that someone sold out just to get it published. There were heaps of tiny details that were present just not utilised. Pity.",0,1
The voice acting in the English version is amongst the worst that I have heard anywhere. I would rate it as almost unplayable. In German however it is a different story. My German is very poor indeed but having already heard the intro in English I could fill in the gaps of the German version. It really was better acting. It is possible that this game deserves a thumbs up for the story and visuals but I will have to park it until I get better with my German. A great shame.,0,1
"The combat is fun. Unfortunately: The world does not feel open enough for an open-world RPG, and the NPCs are not interesting enough for a story-directed RPG. I normally do all the side-quests in an RPG, and in this game there are just so many that they burnt me out. The overarching story is embarrassingly generic. About a third into the game, loot drops become useless; crafting, on the other hand, is overpowered. Feels too much like it was over-simplified for consoles. No support or updates to fix issues.",0,1

"I ALMOST recommend this game with strong reservations. If you can find it cheap, it's a good way to waste a few hours. The accent here is on waste, though.   It's not particularly fun after the first few hours and you quickly realize it's all exactly the same. Once you get higher level, there's... nothing. There's no THERE there. The game is incredibly shallow. There are a number of very enjoyable elements:  Character customization Action-combat Well-flushed, if very vanilla, world Crafting system is an excellent idea, if badly implemented in late game  The problem is that the game is entirely too large. It should have either been much shorter or had a much larger variety in the mechanics. Once you get high level the whole thing's BORING. You cakewalk through quest after quest and get the same unhelpful rewards. The 'oh boy I found the next tier of gear' effect is quickly lost and the entire thing just gets old. Money quickly becomes a waste when you're making all your own gear based on what you loot off monsters.  Basically, the whole game is very unimaginative. I know now why it didn't sell as well as the developers needed it to. It's just meh.  TLDR: 6.5/10 - Starts out great and quickly becomes dull.",0,1

"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. It was initially developed and released as a Half-Life modification by Minh 'Gooseman' Le and Jess 'Cliffe' Cliffe in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. Counter-Strike was first released by Valve on the Microsoft Windows platform in 2000. The game later spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the Counter-Strike series. Several remakes and Ports of Counter-Strike have been released on the Xbox console, as well as OS X and Linux.   Set in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of members of combating teams that include counter-terrorists and terrorists. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's objectives, or else killing all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.",1,0

"First off, don't get fooled by my played hours, I've been playing it way before it was avaiable on steam but I didn't touch it since around 1.5 years. I would estimate that my played hours are somewhere around 3k, I've also participated in 2 tournaments. I would still love this game and recommend it to everyone and their grandma if Aeria wouldn't have messed up AVA like they did.  AVA was a great game back when ijji published it, it had great potential. The maps are great, nothing to complain about here. You could buy Weapons, Grenades and Armor for ingame money. You would get money relatively slow, but once you hit 50-60k € you could buy a decent, permanent weapon and that's pretty much all you needed. You also need money to repair that weapon and buy parts for your weapon that need to get replaced regularly. Getting 50-60k could take up to 1-2 months, depending on how much you played. You could still spend real money on weapons in order to get them immediately. It still was not pay to win at all. The graphics were actually decent for a F2P game. You would encounter hackers from time to time, depending on whether there were any free hacks out there or not.  Ever since Aeria games took over things changed. Their biggest failure was the removal of permanent weapons, which ultimately made the game pay to win. You could only buy weapons for 30 days, then they expired. The price of a decent weapon was still around 50-60k, and I guess you already see that this is a huge problem. If you don't play 3-4 hours per day you won't be able to get 50-60k per month, that means you have to play with the standard weapons which are not entirely useless, but you would never beat someone who is on the same skill level as you with a standard weapon while he uses his expensive rifle. This also meant that old players will always have an advantage over new players, because they still have their permanent weapons.   The thing is, you may think that the publisher should have no influence on the content of the game, since they are only publishing, but not making it. Redduck is actually making the game, and they do so for several other regions such as Japan/China/Korea. All of those regions still have permanent weapons. In fact, Aeria denied to have anything to do with the change from permanent to timed weapons, but we actually contacted someone from Redduck who told us that they were against that change, but Aeria insisted.  The next point are hackers. Aeria implemented a new anti cheat engine that doesn't do its job at all. There were times where you would run into a hacker every 2-3 games. I can't tell you how it is in its current state tho, since I haven't played since quite some time.  By the way, Aeria introduced the 'Tiered Spender' where you would get additional rewards depending on how much money you spend on their game. That's a nice concept, but the thing is that many of those additional rewards are permanent weapons, which is another aspect that makes it pay to win. Just to give you an idea on what you have to spend for a permanent weapon: In one of those tiered spenders you would get a permanent weapon starting at 7999 AP(a little more than 60€) and ending at 29999 AP(around 210€).  This is coming from someone who sometimes played this game all day long, played 2 tournaments and even made a few videos, my best montage got around 2k views, my overall best AVA video has around 10k views. If you have LOTS of money and can live with the fact that this game is pay to win then by all means, get it. I've been putting a decent amount of money into this game myself, and I would never do it again. Money still doesn't buy you skill, but it surely gives you an huge advantage. The next thing to consider are the hackers, everytime there are free hacks on a certain site AVA will be unplayable, and you might even get banned despite being a legitimate player (At one point hackers were able to use your name, which earned you lots of reports). And then I wish you good luck with Aerias automated support answers when you try to appeal a ban.  In the end it's up to you, but I can not recommend it in its current state.   *UPDATE*  I still play a round or two every few months, and I was positively surprised when I played yesterday. Permanent guns are back, but they are really expensive and it surely will take you quite some time until you have enough money for a good gun. I think they need to either make the weapons cheaper, or give you the option to try them out for free before you buy them permanently. It now feels a lot like back in the days when I still used to play this game all day long, but it still has a few pay to win elements. You are still not going to be able to beat a good player if you are average and spend a lot of money, but it's harder for beginners to get into the game, because it will take lots of time until you found the right gun, can afford it, and got enough money to buy armor as well. So it's not pay to win in the sense that bad players will defeat good players because they spent money, but good players who already have an advantage over new/bad players will have an even bigger advantage, so expect to have a hard time in the beginning if you plan on playing AVA.   If you are starting out I recommend you check out some guides because there are some things you should know that are not immediately obvious. Here is an (old) thread that's actually meant for players who want to play AVA competitively, but still is relevant and could give you some useful tips:  http://www.aeriagames.com/forums/en/viewtopic.php?t=1885997   Hackers are still around, but it's not as bad as it used to be. It is understandable that they can't prevent hacking, because they can only react to hacks after they have been released for the most part. They surely are doing things to stop hackers before they actually get to do any damage, we have XIGNCODE after all. It's similar to bugs and glitches, if you programming a game or program you are going to try to avoid bugs, but you can't eliminate every single bug before they actually occured. The best you can do is try to prevent them to your best ability, so there will be as few bugs as possible.  So, I still don't recommend this game, altho it got a lot better. AVA is on a good path right now and maybe I will one day be able to recommend it again. I even think I'm going to play it more regularly from now on. Maybe I will give AVA a positive review one day, but today is not that day.",1,0

Activision have to make changes, even destroy dedicated servers in order to look like they're doing something out there. That step was a TERRIBLE, HORRIFYING MISTAKE. And unspeakable disgrace.

"In most multiplayer games, kids like to adapt what I call the 'naiive driver' attitude, where cars going faster/driving more aggressive than you are crazy, reckless, cop magnets. while cars going slower/driving more passively than you are obviously in no hurry to get anywhere, they must be senior citizens in the driver seat and well the world would be better off without them.  This game is absolutely ridden with children like these. I consider myself a pretty good player (I get some ridiculous KDRs...) but as always, those who are better than you MUST be hacking. Those who are worse than you are ♥♥♥♥ing noobs and need to learn how to play.  In addition to the community complaints, I have a bone to pick with those who consistently use the most overpowered or trolling weapons. People like to justify this with 'its in the game', but this fallacy is overturned when they realize that metaknight is in super smash bros brawl, the moon breaker laser was in Golden Eye, and the 1-hit-KO hadouken upgrade was in megaman X. Just because the programmers of the game wanted to make a few guns easier to use and overall better than others doesn't mean they meant for the grenade launchers and akimbo glocks to be abused all the damn time. Yes they're programmed into the game and if you buy it you'll have to deal with it.  Pros: I liked the single player campaign it was fun. Spec ops are fun too. Cons: Community in multiplayer blows, hackers run amok ♥♥♥♥ing with lobbies and your customized classes and whatnot, some children will whine and cry while others will troll the hell out of u with cheap strategies and annoying classes.  Don't get this game I still play it because I'm good enough to ♥♥♥♥ with everyone. That's about it.",1,0

"Story drags from one repetative quest to another. The real time combat system and gear system is wierd. For instance a stealther with a shield? Even a decent way into the game I find myself spamming the same attack combo over and over.  EA also gives you buffed gear in the beginning, one set is themed after Sheapard from Mass Effect. IT is seriously overpowered, and will make you for a good part of the beginning of the game wonder why the game drops gear at all.  I really want to like this game have tried it several times to try to get into it, but just cannot. It has great graphics and the main story is interesting, that is about where it ends.

"Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of the most disappointing games I've played recently; not because it's bad, but because it was almost great.  It seems to me after playing it that it may have been designed to be an MMO, but was converted late in development to a basic single-player-only Action RPG, one that's very light in design depth. The action side of things is a very standard hack-and-slash set-up that would be familiar to players of anything from Zelda to God of War. However, it's marred by bad mechanics, such as mobs that rotate to follow your dodge roll and the combination of long ability cooldowns and instantaneous potion use. Rather than fight the giant bosses by blocking and dodging and using powerful spells, it's much more effective to mash attack while tapping the health potion button.  The RPG side fares worse, with talents and skills that are usually completely worthless, but punctuated with a few over the top broken abilities (such as Elemental Rage). There's also the likes of Dispel and Lockpick, which are worthless as dispelling rarely works right and lockpicking rarely fails, regardless of how many points you have. Participation in the story is just not there, apart from the tiny handful of 'Rescue Orphans or Eat Kittens' choices. (The overwhelming appearance of the yea-or-nay choice in dialogue is usually a 'But Thou Must' situation.)  On the other hand, the world, story, writing, and presentation are top-notch. (Well, apart from the 'We call Elves 'Aoeuolhffwvyr'' problem and the ripping-off-Warhammer graphics that were already old when Warcraft 3 came out.) Which brings me to the frustrating decision here. Is it worth putting up with generic, boring, poorly-designed gameplay for a fun, well-realized, and utterly huge RPG world? For my part, I say skip it. You may enjoy it, but only if you can put up with the problems above.",0,1

There's a barragement of overpowered and underpowered weapons, the ACR wrecks all enemies and the M16 might as well not be there. The map design is horrid, offering infinite opportunities for camping. There's also deathstreaks which can increase your health, give you your killer's loadout, etc.  Then there's the community; teenagers claiming to have sexual relations with your mother, idiots who tell you to kill yourself because you're the host and the game is laggy without them realizing that the netcode is horrid, people who run around the map quickscoping/trickshotting instead of playing the game, people who intentionally make their loadout overpowered, etc.   It's a blitzkrieg of flawed game design and you shouldn't spend your money on it.",0,1

"This game was piece of art when it first came out, so many improvements from Call of Duty 4. The campaign for Modern Warfare 2 was an absolute masterpiece, you continue on from Call of Duty 4, playing as different branches, with different characters, though this game does have it's moments being a bit repetative later on in the game but something new always pops up to give you a boost of interest, the graphics for this game are amazing, huge step up from COD4, the AI is improved but still has it's moments where it is completely unintelligent and has no regard for itself, animations are great, many weapons throughout the campaign to choose from, the singplayer earns a 9/10. As for the multiplayer I cannot say the same, let me start off saying that Modern Warfare 2 is only worth playing for it's singeplayer due to the fact that the multiplayer is full of hackers all day everyday, and you can risk being deranked in a specific server, that goes with saying you can be at risk for a VAC ban for claims of cheating, the multiplayer is nice and all, lot's of intense fighting, however the hackers are the main reason why multiplayer is ruined for this, so I do not recommend this game for it's multiplayer.",0,1

The gameplay is frustrating on any difficulty (I tried it on multiple difficulties) and it is at the point where I cant play this with mouse + keyboard without slamming my head against a wall. Get it only if it is under $5 and you have a controller to play with. To the developers that shutdown - Thank you for shutting down your atrocious company, have a nice day, f**k off, and I will be back to beat your s****y game once I get a controller to use.",0,1
"This used to be a great game but now it got old. Multiplayer is dead-empty, and even if you manage to connect to a full-populated match, 20% of players are cheaters or noobsters with G18 akimbo.  In short, dont buy this. Used to be a good game but it's worthless now.",0,1

"Everything about this game is just pretty bland, I stopped paying attention to the plot after a half hour, which is really sad for an RPG. itemization is poor, I spent 7 of the 10 hours played using the same weapon, which was a 'green' quality weapon which for some reason was better than some blue or purple weapons I found. The music was forgettable, as were the characters that I ran into, the world, and the writting/dialouge.   The combat isn't bad, but it lacks a lot of options you would normally expect to find in games like this. You have a melee/range attack button and a magic attack button and that's about it, melee combos act the same nearly every time with the same weapon and in the first 10 hours there were 3 attack spells, 1 of which was worth using. There are some other melee abilities if you invest in them, but they never appeared to be any better than just using a normal 3 hit standard melee combo.   This is essentially a single player MMO, with a more active combat system but without a lot of the things you expect from MMOs, but at least there's a lot of quests and a bit of grinding, so if you're into that, this game will give you some good play time but otherwise I can't recommend this.",0,1
"I've played too much WoW for this to be enjoyable. The combat is good-ish, but is hampered by the fact that the game even on hard mode isn't actually hard (infact I'd say that hard is very easy, especially if you try to finish all the quests in each zone and get overgeared). I would not recommend this game because this game lacks the polish that I'd expect from a single player RPG, and lacks the multiplayer advantages from an MMORPG. I completed the first four zones or so and found the game to be just too easy/monotonous to be enjoyable, and thus will not be finishing the entire thing. But if there's one thing I can say is that this game has A LOT of content (apparently anyway, I'm not sticking around to find out.), so if you can buy it cheap go for it.",0,1
"I really wanted to like this game however I cannot recommend for one simple reason, bad story. The gameplay is solid despite the dated graphics. Also it is a fun shooter. However the end is an extreme let down to me and overall the story is just terrible. I found I didn't care about any of the characters and no one felt real.  In all if you want a fun shooter but don't care about story this game is worth your time, but that is it. If you end up liking this game I highly recommend checking Singularity, its at least as fun and the story is surprising how good it is as well as the way it is told.",0,1

"First of all, my beefs with this game.  -Very short story. -Time powers drain ridiculously fast. -Practically no character interaction or any real explanation as to what's taken place to explain the events of this story. -Obvious setup for a sequel which will never happen. -Unfair mind reading AI which necessitates the need for the time bending powers. If you think good aim or reflexes will get you far, think again. -Another deaf mute protagonist. -No running -Unnecessary kill cam for no reason. -Overall poor execution of what could've been a memorable  Having said that, heres the little that I did like about the game.  -Good graphics for it's time. -Decent textures -4k support -Decent gun mechanics -Very original time combat mechanic and for solving puzzles. -Difficult and challenging.  I feel that for everything this game was trying to do right it, it poorly executed it while tacking on more annoying things than enjoyable. Overall, not worth the $4.99 I paid.  ",0,1

"Ok, I admit, I played this game back in my childhood on my original Xbox, and had so much fun. Not too long ago I reinstalled it for my computer, but when I did, I HATED it. I couldn't play right. People would one tap me from the side of the map, others will just be an absolute pro with the AWP making life so hard. Theres no mercy for new players, there's no official Valve servers, only the community servers which take away the classic feel. I have probably only joined 2 servers that have none of the stupid annoying Quake sounds. No 'double kill' or 'dominating' just classic CS 1.6. It was aggrovating for me, my favourite childhood game gone to waste, or so I thought. I was just bad at the game. I was scared to do anything. If I pushed in first, I thought I would get destroyed immediately. The guns felt weird and ridiculously inaccurate, the game didn't FEEL right, and anything I tried would ultimately fail. Well, until a couple of weeks ago.   I played violent. I played smart. I played gruesome and unforgiving. Getting 4 man spray downs and one-double tap headshots across the map. I was ruthless, relentless, and I enjoyed it. This game was starting to be fun for me, not as annoying, not as frustrating, only fun, as I always wanted it to be. The thing is I learned not to be scared, the same with CSGO. I played CSGO, sucked at it, played horribly until I just began to not care if I died. That was when I began to play better. CS 1.6 came, and I began to be horrifying. Enemy teams would scream at me, I would laugh and continue, their unfornate moments was fuel to my wrath, until, of course as it always happens, a pro AWPer comes towards me and 420 swagscopes me in the face. Rage quit.  11/10 would get Blazed it again.",1,0

"Half-Life: Counter-strike has redefined online play. This game has more potential and more online gaming goodness than any other game I've ever played.

"A still alive first-person shooter, since 2000. The game that changed everything, along with Half-Life. Still, the best first-person for thousands. And you know why? Because this game's focus isn't on graphics. It's for having fun with your friends, or, even aim for world turnaments.  All proffesional teams, such as fnatic, navi, sk, still play Counter-Strike, doesn't matter if it is 1.6, Source or Global Offensive.   Highly recommend this game.",1,0
Very good classic Counter Strike. Much better then CS:GO!,1,0
"Make sure you like the core poker-styled game mechanic before you buy because that (and the nice presentation) carry the game. If you like the gameplay, this would be a good game for you. If you're unsure or not especially enthused, there are other games that might suit you better.  Took me a couple of tries to finish the game; I stopped playing and restarted a couple times because I got bored with the game mechanic or early grinding for silver.  Not a very long game once you learn how to properly win games. The story is really like a prelude to the 'real story' which is never revealed. The ending is pretty lackluster. As far as I can tell, there is no reason to Continue+ (for achievements, it's better to just not do the last stage so don't have to unlock all the map again).  Almost all allies are either impractical or unnecessary. Hrodbrokk is a pretty good source of damage for the RP/AP it takes; Brin is usually a waste of a turn because you should be better off moving cards around for bigger damage and using the RP elsewhere.",1,0
"Well the bad thing is there are so MANY hackers and if they get VAC Ban, they just make new account and share their library.. so they can get back on and hack again easily so I think the anti cheat should work better to stop the hackers from ruining the game I stopped playing MW2 and barely play it because of hackers. GOOD THING: It's cheap, great game but just too many hackers. Hope this helped. If you get this game I recommend just playing single player and on servers with no hackers.",1,0

"Counter-Strike was the game that changed everything for me in FPS games, coming from older games like the FPS Game Blood back in (1997) when I was only 10 years old and Half-Life, Counter-Strike changed everything for me it was litterally the best thing ever.  The quality of the game was never about the visuals for me but about the game play and performance and Counter-Strike litterally had it all in my opinion.  Even today after so many years, I occasionally come back and play Counter-Strike just because it is one of the greatest Counter-Strike versions flat out, anyone disputing this are most likely people that started playing either Counter-Strike: Source or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive first then tried Counter-Strike but if you played it in the right order there is no disputing this, because this game might frighten most the new generation that has expectations to visual graphics having to have a certain standard before they will even touch it.  Counter-Strike is not about the visuals, that is just a bonus, if you want visuals then you probably playing the wrong game, Counter-Strike was never Battlefield nor CoD which probably to many looks visually stunning.  If you want quality in a game then Counter-Strike is one of the best games to play and get, hence why I am recommending this game.",1,0

"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.",1,0

"People still play 4 Game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Hardcore Team Deathmatch and Domination (sometimes you can find Search &amp; Destroy but not usually). Most of the time you won't have a problem with TDM but any other game mode you will be waiting several minutes for Steam to setup a lobby and when you get one it will likely be laggy. I got this game on sale for 10 bucks a couple weeks ago and it was worth it... But I would definitely not recommend paying 20 bucks for this game unless you only like Team Deathmatch.   Oh, and it is full of hackers. If you can deal with people shooting you through walls when they shouldn't even know you're there then this one's for you! I would actually guess that AT LEAST 7/10 people are actually cheating in this game. Since the anti-cheat engine is disabled they don't even try to hide it anymore. Never seen such blatantly obvious hacks in a game before. I rate this game ***Fart noise*** out of 10.  UPDATE! Reverted to Windows 7, had to reinstall the game. Won't even run in Windows 7.

"I was only able to play 26 hours of this game before i uninstalled it. I really tried to get into it, but there are a few things that just really got on my nerves me and makes it unenjoyable.   My main issue with it is the camera. You are stuck looking directly over the shoulder of the character with no way to zoom out and its extremely frustrating. I like to have the control to zoom out further and this honestly seems like such a simple fix, I am surprised that it hasnt been included in the game yet through some patch. I guess developers don't care. maybe it was because they didnt spend much time on the maps and you would be zooming through objects, i dunno.  I tried the widescreenfix program on many different settings and to get zoomed out to the point I enjoy it around 100-110 degrees, the image is so fisheyed and distorted. That and it has issues phasing have to constantly keep resetting it with the hotkey etc. Honestly, just comes down to the fact that the majority of my gameplay seems to be focused on getting a nice camera vantage and less about the game itself. The widescreenfix is really not meant for this, its meant more for spreading games out onto multiple displays. The fix should of been implemented by the developers and seeing that people have been complaining about this since it's release, that's just disappointing.  I was not drawn into the story. Seems like a cool premise, but the quests are rather boring and the landscape and dungeons honestly start to feel the same, I've cleared the majority of the western map, including its dungeons now and there's different textures and what not, but I feel like i'm just running down a tunnel everywhere i go. I have no issue with linear maps, dragon age was a great example of how linear maps can still be done right, but these are just dull. I just didn't feel attached to the lore and the world.   Combat is kinda cool. Similar to guildwars 2 in that you get different attacks based on weapons. Spells come from talents. I enjoyed the combat.  Fast travel system is nice, but there are still some dungeons that are really large and you can't fast travel from within them, so you must run to the exit. Spend 5-10 min doing that some times. meh  might be good for some, but honestly I just uninstalled it cuz of the camera. That seriously killed it for me. Fans probably can turn a cheek to it.",0,1

"This IS a good game. BUT BE WARNED -  Multiplayer is littered with hackers and cheaters.    There is a noticable number of players who are one or more of the following:    Invincible    Able to kick other players at will    Able to unlock max rank etc.    Using aim bots    Using wall hacks    Have unlimited knife/melee distance    Able to control public lobbies as if they were private ones    and various other things.   Infinity Ward/Activision don't care, they're busy squeezing cash out of fanboys' pockets. I've contacted Activision support multiple times, and they literally don't care at all. Considering they're still charging £20 for the game, I'd say that's disgusting...  It's a great shame, because it has a great single-player, great co-op, and the multiplayer IS good, but people have ruined it. All I can really do at this point is go to their Steam profiles and report a violation. Some people will rage in the text chat 'why must you hack? it's ruining the game' or similar, and 99% of the time the response is 'hahaha cry more' or 'shut up u ♥♥♥♥♥♥', as you'd expect. It's be GLORIOUS if these toxic people were VAC banned, but I doubt any of the higher-ups will do anything about it.  Not so much angry, as I am sad.  Edit: Steam displays my hours played in single player. I currently have 69 hours in multiplayer at time of edit.  Edit 2: The 'unhelpful' votes for this review are from fanboys who are infatuated with grenade launchers, trickshots, and probably some hackers themselves.  Which reminds me... the playerbase in MW2 is   outrageously   toxic. The number of times I've been called a f#ggot, had cancer wished upon, been told to kill myself, insulted for using a certain weapon or equipment... seriously, someone wished for my mother to die of explosive diarrhoea because I was using an MP5K.

For example when I was 7, installing the cracked version of that game and then just shooting anyone who gets in my way without controlling the recoil. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ and lol traded this game for some crappy AK-47 in CS GO. Huehuehuehuehue. I give it 8/8 m8. pls liek no hate no homo tenks. Oh and btw the funniest thing about this game is brining your CS GO skills there, doing 1 hit kills and then getting banned from servers for 'hacking' Like I've joined a sever once, done 7 headshots in a row without dying, then some speccy ♥♥♥♥ is sayin': 'wh and aim off or im banning you.'

Bad: -90% of enemies/zones/quest structures/character models are recycled. -Cliché telling of previously-mentioned premise. -Boring repetetive sidequests have you forgetting what the main quest actually is. -No interesting/memorable characters.

"Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this. I've got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP.

" -----EDIT-------  A lot of people have been accusing me of cheating in MW2 Multiplayer lately. This is entirely false, I did not cheat whatsoever. At the time I was playing there were (and probably still are) A LOT of hacked lobbies. What happened to me was I logged into a modded game. After being in it for few seconds it disconnected me from it with a message saying ' Bad host '. So I was like ok but then I noticed that literally all of the stats were unlocked (Titles, Emblems, Weapons and their attachemnts, etc.), it also boosted me from being a lvl 30 or something noob to a lvl 70, allowing me to enter prestige mode. I didn't deal with that, just a bit worried. I looked up on some forum, found that people encountered the same problem and that you need to contact support as soon as possible otherwise it'll ban you. I didn't know at the time how to deal with it so I went with the flow, hoping nothing will happen to my account. Then after a few weaks I recieved a ban, saying ' Cheat detected '. I then tried to contact any support but people on the forum stated it's too late because Steam Support won't listen to people who got VAC banned.  ALSO NOTE:  I remembered that around the initial VAC ban my account was hijacked and couldn't retrieve it after a year when a Steam Support finally realized the issue. I assume that the hijacker went downloading the possible external software for the game and used it on it in order to get me banned. I remember that guy, go check him up, his name is 'solutioNNN' and also has a VAC ban from MW2. I am not lying about this, no I am not making this up, this is my honest review.  -------------------  Singleplayer: Wonderful! Special Ops: Wonderful, even co-op is great! Multiplayer: THE WORST, EVERY TIME YOU GO TO LOBBY, YOU COULD ENTER A HACKED ONE, RESULTING IN UNLOCKING EVERY WEAPON, WEAPON ATTACHMENT, EMBLEM, TITLE, ETC. THIS WILL RESULT IN A UNFAIR VAC BAN. I do not recommend this game simply because of this mess. I recommend you to pirate this game just to experience the wonderful storyline. Oh, and if you happen to buy it and find that your items are all unlocked, I suggest you contacting the Steam Support before   getting a possible permanent ban .",1,0

KB&amp;M work fine but this game was made for a controller, a controller that you cannot use because 1 button is mapped to 7 different actions and cannot be remapped.

"As a Postal fan, I was surprised to see this wasn't actually good. I got to the second mission, where you have to use cat nip spray to get a bunch of HIV cats, however, there was a few problems.  1: When a cat gets latched onto you, you have to spam left and right mouse to get it off. This wouldn't be a problem, but if you have the cat nip out, you can easily press right mouse, which consumes a ton of cat nip that's needed for the mission. Yes, it's limited. No, there are no refills (not as far as I could see)  2: The Chinese gang never stopped attacking me. And this is the second level, where my only weapons are cats, cat nip spray, and a vacuum. They had pistols, machetes, and M16s. Little unfair. Also, they never stopped respawning, leaving little time for me to grab the cats. I ended up having to throw a cat at one of the guys to grab a machete, which took some time. Which brings me to point 3.  3: Some weapons are broken. My favorite weapon from Postal 2, the machete, is reduced to a useless toy. The main attack took many attacks, and throwing it like a boomerang was hard. The machete wasn't thrown at the crosshair, rather below it, and even then it would miss a ton of targets. Also, it got stuck often, even when thrown in an open space.  After dying 3 times, the game crashed. I was dissapointed in this game. The gore is better than Postal 2 in my opinion, but there's so many glitches and the game is unfair on the earliest levels. Although, I'm probably one of the few who's okay with the new voice actor (mainly because Akella actually offered to have Rick Hunter voice the game, though he refused) and while some lines were pretty funny to me ('I blame pacman.') some lines pretty much made me cringe. ('Bacon bacon bacon!' and other fire related lines) I also think I heard him say a really old meme (the cheeseburger one) but since this game was made in 2011 I can excuse that.  If you do plan on getting this game, turn off motion blur at the start. It'll save you a lot of headaches.  ",0,1

"F*ck you!!!!!  I am so full of rage right now it's unreal. I have been a loyal fan of Call of Duty for a very long time even pre my PC days. I have racked up over 700 hours on COD Ghosts and nearly 200 hours on Black Ops 2. At the weekend I randonly recieved a notification mid game during my gameplay in Ghosts to say that I had been permanently banned from online multiplayer. No reason! Just a notice. I have never cheated on a game in my life, I collect games, I achievement hunt and I have a f*cking expensive PC, all of which pretty much cements me being a solid and dedicated gamer. I contacted Activiton and went on the community hum on Steam and all I am told is it's irreversable and they say I have breached one of their t&amp;c's for fair play. What the actual f*ck?? Why would I rack up nearly 1000 hours to then decide to cheat?! Are they F*cking stupid? I think this is absolutely disgusting and I am totally enraged by this because they have given me no explanation whatsoever other than a link to their policy agreement which is total BS. I am so enraged I am now refusing to buy anything from these c*nts ever again. How can someone or a company have the right to do this to a customer, especially when I am a loyal customer and have done nothing wrong at all.

"Note: the following is about the single-player version. I don't play multiplayer so cannot comment on it. If you're buying it for the multiplayer, look at other reviews. If you're considering buying it for the single player, this review is meant for you. FYI.  It's so scripted that there is little to no replayability unless you enjoy doing exactly the same thing over and over and are enamoured with learning what is effectively an elaborate dance routine (shoot there, spin around, shoot there, move 2 meters, shoot there, etc.). So $/hr of enjoyment is limited. Lucky I only buy these things at massive discount Steam sales.  Overall storyline is strained. On the plus side, many of the missions are somewhat entertaining the first time around. Some are annoying as hell, apparently made to simply annoy the player, or perhaps showcase a particular element that the developers were particular proud of. None made me think 'wow, that was great'. The ending was, as with CoD4:MW, an annoying as hell tightly scripted cutscene.  Will I get the CoD:MW3? Probably, but only at a massive discount (ie: under CDN$10). Because so far the series isn't worth more than that. But for $10, it's an OK buy.  PS: You can't even turn off the repetive music. Instead, you'll have it blaring your ears while you TRY to listen for the killer dogs approaching, or footsteps behind you. There are ways to turn it off by hacking the system (well, renaming a file) but that compromises the local file integrity. Go figure.  PPS: Having now tried the multiplayer, my opinion doesn't change. The main issue is their idea of 'server selection'. As in: you don't get a choice. You are connected to the first server it finds, and servers are user-operated so anything can happen. The system does not offer a list of available servers. So if you're in a group you don't want to play with (ie: they've hacked the server so much it's useless), you're stuck, because that's the first one the game will find. Alternative services have been aggressively shut down by the distributor for some reason. As for gameplay, it's the usual mix of perfectly reasonable people with an unfortunate leavening of cheaters.   PPPS: Oh, and if you want to play around in single player, expect a LOT of issues trying to get the console working, and keeping it working. It was working, I 'resumed' a game, and now it's not working any more. Yes, I've made all the necessary changes to config.cfg, yes I've made config.cfg read-only so the damn game doesn't overwrite it with a stored copy (why in HELL have a config.cfg if there's a stored copy, I'll never understand), but it still won't bloody work. ANNOYED! Doesn't change my recommendation though, my opinion of the game was already low.  Definitely not at all recommended unless you get this game at a steep, steep discount.",0,1

"As much as I enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it.  There is still no custom lobby support / dedicated server browsing. There are cheaters in EVERY game and it seems that there is absolutely no anti-cheating mechanism in place, since they don't get VAC banned or even kicked. And they removed the absolute best map of any first person shooters (my favorite): favela.  I actually bought this on steam only to be able to play in that map in multiplayer again, and to my enormous disappointment found out they removed it YEARS ago because of some misplaced potentially religion-offending content and never patched it back.  Game has potential, still the most fun CoD, but the devs made very poor choices and basically showed the consumers their middle finger.",0,1

You make decisions that affect the way you progress through the game, but even the joy of that is sucked out of this game... Because of this game. Not sure what made Running With Scissors take the leap from Unreal Engine in Postal 2 to Source in Postal III. Not sure what they expected in adding zombies to Postal, or forcing really annoying combat encounters, or never really giving you a moment to properly understand what's happening. This game tries too hard to be offensive, yet funny, to have stuff to do, in a world with nothing to do, to have a story in a series that never had one, and decals constantly overlap one another. Voice-acting is overall poor, and even for people that like low-brow humor (like myself) this game just takes it too far. It's not funny, it's just annoying.  + Kill Uwe Boll + Weapons + Postal violence  - Annoying fourth wall breaks - Possibly the worst use of Source Engine I've ever seen - Glitches galore! - Annoying voice acting - Never a moment's peace to explore and just do whatever I want, like in Postal 2 - Combat that's sometimes WAY too annoying - Zombies, in Postal - Tries too hard to do too many things at once",0,1

"Call of duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoD MW2) is the game that ruined Call of Duty Franchise.   Let's start with singleplayer. Singleplayer and escpecially Co-op missions were still somewhat ok, but singleplayer also had many things that I didn't like. First of all the singleplayer was filled with too many cutscenes. At least I play games to play them and not to watch movies. Of course the plot is important, but too much of cutscenes is just too much.   Another problem was that the plot was just too ridiculous. This is connected in many ways with with the third problem. The thing that I really liked in previous Call of Duty games and especially in the first Call of Duty game was the feeling of fighting with other soldiers (unlike in most early FPS games, in which you are a lone wolf) or how it was said in the cover of the manual of the very first Call of Duty game: 'No one fights alone'. This no longer applies in CoD MW 2 and the games following it. In CoD MW 2 you no longer fight with large group of fellow soldiers. Instead you fight alone or with only a couple of guys at most.  Now to multiplayer, which was the real disappointment. In the first Call of Duty game the maps were larger and more open but for some ridiculous reason the maps kept getting smaller and had more and more bottle necks as the series progressed. I could somehow cope with that until this game and i might have coped with it still if it had been the only problem, but it wasn't. The main problem that I have with this game are its ridiculous killstreak rewards and killstreak requirements. In CoD 4 the killstreaks were still somewhat acceptable, but CoD MW2 is no longer an FPS game. It is a game of killstreaks rewards. That is just not fun. The CoD games after this one have continued the usage of ridiculous killstreak rewards and because of this I will probably never again buy Call of Duty games. (To be honest, I predicted that this game was going to be horrible, and as a result I didn't buy this game, but instead got it as a gift.) Multiplayer part of MW 2 also suffers from decision to not to have dedicated servers.  Grade for Singleplayer: 6/10 Grade for Multiplayer: 2/10  Edited 26 Nov ember 10:29 to correct annoying typo. Edited to change 'the maps were large and open' to the maps were larger and more open' Edited 14 January 23:26 to fix a minor typo. Edited 18 February 21:03 Lack of dedicated servers added.",0,1
"The game doesnt work, it stops working everytime I start a new game, and closes it. Aditionaly, the game wont recognize any graphics card that has more than 1.5Gb of VRAM, and will limit your gameplay to 720p and no Anti-Aliasing. Two fixes were found so far for this last problem, but one wont work with steam version of the game, and the other involves changing a dll inside the game system folder, something like a crack. It worked for me in the menu, but the game is still crashing.  The fact is the game is broken, and there are no devs around anymore. If you want this, I sugest you search a little bit about its problems. And make sure the refund is available.  [EDIT] My specs: Win10 64bit 16GB ram 2x780ti SLI i7 4930K  [EDIT2] I just found a workaround for the crashing: Going into the computer BIOS and disabling the CPU's HyperThreading.

"All in all, the game just feels... disingenuous. It was difficult enough to recommend this game. I was previously under the impression that had this game not been so poorly optimized (multiple crashes, poor hit detection, abysmal framerate during combat), this game would have been perceived as just... okay. However, I had to give my two cents.  Pros: *The Soundtrack - surprisingly good. Clearly much more effort went into it than everything else.  Aaaand that's about it.  Netural Points: *Third person perspective - I personally don't mind it, but it would've been nice to have had the option of having a first person perspective, too. *Corey Cruise as Postal Dude - disappointing to not have Rick Hunter's amazing voice soothing my ears, but Cruise still does a commendable job.  Cons:  Hoo boy. Here we go.  *The Humor - The game made me laugh out loud a few times, but it needed more originality. Rehashing lines and jokes from Postal 2 doesn't make it funny. It feels forced. Also, guys, making The Postal Dude say 'I blame (irrelevant subject here)!' nearly every time he kills something isn't. funny. The only one that made me laugh was 'I blame Christian Metal.'  *No map, arrows, or anything that indicated where to go next. *The annoyingly long loading times. *Poor optimization. *crashes frequently. *stutters every time a new mission starts. *A.I. can be incredibly stupid, especially when you're supposed to protect someone. *The sound is imbalanced. The last mission was nothing but LOUD gunfire. Nearly put me in a trance. Did give me a headache, though. *No Open-world exploration in between missions - Seriously??? This is what made Postal 2 so much fun!  *The Story is told in past tense - Kind of hard to explain, but The Postal Dude narrates the entire game and explains what happens next in the story. This is fine, but sometimes it's better to PLAY and not TELL what happens next. Can I please PLAY the scenario out and not have to be bombarded with cutscenes that break the momentum and flow?  *Good/Evil karma system, Multiple Endings - interesting idea. good for replayability. Too bad I achieved one of the endings in about 5 hours, most of which were spent wondering where the heck I was supposed to go next. Besides, there's no way I'd want to replay this again. Too much of a chore.  Did I enjoy myself during this game? A little. Did I laugh? Yes. Are Postal 2, and Postal 2: Paradise Lost superior to this game in every conceivable way? Oh yes. Heck yes.",0,1

"Postal 3 starts with Uwe Boll giving you the finger, in a loading screen. This follows through the missions where it's apparent that the game it's just trying to mess with the player but not in the good old fashioned Postal way.

Postal 3 it's the pinnacle of bad game design, and insultity for the pleyer and the series, i'ts the lame, pathetic excuse that comes from a group of people that believe comedy begins with a fart and ends with and insult, with people that make pathetic. lame jokes, thinking that what causes controversy and makes someone feel offended somehow it's an attractive point in entertainment.

"I'm not going to claim that 'Postal 2' was a masterpiece of the art form. It wasn't. It was trashy, poorly coded, and its humour was more groan worthy than anything. But goddamit, it WAS fun in some sick, twisted way - particularly when aided by the 'A Week in Paradise' mod that expanded its variety and fixed a lot of its bugs, etc. It was a cathartic experience that let you indulge in a bit of depravity to let the stress flow by. 'Postal III' on the other hand, is a torture simulator at the players expense - not the NPCs. This game is abysmally bad. The hit detection is the worst I've ever experienced in a game, and even when you do hit there's no sense of tactile feedback. There is not a single weapon in this game, except perhaps the Badger, that is in any way satisfying to use. About the only praise I can give this game in ANY sense is that while the humour is still pretty rank, there are a few more genuinely good, surreal jokes that might hit low brow sensibilities. I actually did laugh once or twice when the joke wasn't 'Misogyny/gross stuff' etc. This is the most broken ♥♥♥ game I've ever seen released that took so long to make, this was in development as far back as 2004 and yet it feels like a proof of concept alpha - a proof of concept that in any true quality assurance workers mind, would not see as proving any viable concept at all. Its linear, broken, and practically unplayable. Say what you will about Postal 2 and its flaws - but at least everyone can agree that this one is legitimately pure ♥♥♥♥.",0,1

"This game seemed to strive for the depth characteristic of the Elder Scrolls games, but it came off as cheap and simple. The story was forgettable and most of the characters were as well. The combat was entertaining up until I hit my level cap, then it was nothing more than an annoyance as enemies were no longer the slightest bit challenging. Even the final boss was simple to defeat while losing no more than maybe 10% of my health. I hit my level cap roughly half-way through my playtime (120 hours, including Dead Kel and Teeth of Naros DLC).  The biggest annoyance was the lockpicking. The controls are not fined-tuned at all, so it's nearly impossible to pick with actual skill, even when working on a lowest level lock with a fully leveled lockpicking skill. The auto-picking uses up a lockpick, even if your skill grants you a 100% chance of succeeding. Unforunately, you don't find enough lockpicks to go auto-picking everything unless you purchase lockpicks at every opportunity.",0,1

"I bought this game due to the sale price and the glowing IGN review... and holy crap this is the most generic RPG I've ever played. The art style is a direct ripoff of WOW, attempting to mask low poly counts and a lack of advanced effects with overly bright colors. NPC interactions are ripped directly from recent Bioware titles. The lockpicking system is an exact copy of Skyrim. I was willing to overlook the ugly WOW-clone graphics for an open-world hack and slasher like Dragon's Dogma, since the Fighter/Rogue/Mage class sytem is identical to that game (suprise?) but the combat lacks Dogma's satisfying brutality.   Normally I like it when elements of great games are remixed into something new, but it's all done in such a clunky way, it just makes me wish I were playing the other, better games.   Ultimately this game feels like something that was put together in a soulless board room full of suits who picked pieces of top selling games at random in search of cold, hard profits... and oh look, it's EA, so that's probably exactly what happened.",0,1

"Big Huge Games should change their name to Big Huge Empty Games. The game played amazing for the first two hours, but then quickly devolved into feeling like a cheap mmo with no people. The world was artistically baren with an extra drought for interest. Repetitive enemies, boss fights, NPC's, side-quests, scenery, etc. cripple this game beyond redemption, not to mention the extensive overuse of particle effects and vasalensing. This game is all hype and no substance. Recommended alternative: Darksiders, which uses the same game engine and peripherals, but has so, so much more to offer. And if you've already played it, play it again.",0,1
"This is a horribly overrated game, and it has no value aside from a vast world and semi-legit voice acting. If you're looking for a single player game of the same quality as a free-to-play MMORPG, then you may enjoy this, other than that - don't waste your time and money.  Combat and movement mechanics are horrid: if you're standing on a hill - your attacks go perpedicular to your character, so if an enemy is right in front of you and you're theoretically targetting them - your projectiles go right above their heads (or into the hill at their feet, if you're below them). There doesn't appear to be a way to cancel your long-charge combo attacks, so if you see a new enemy jump out from the side of the screen while in the middle of a combo - you're screwed, forced to just sit there and helplessly watch yourself getting hit. The game is completely 2D as far as the movement plane goes, there is no jumping aside from a few designated spots (with a special animation). Smallest rocks on the ground have huge collision boxes, making you walk all the way around them instead of over them, (and i'm not exaggerating - some of those rocks are maybe 3 inches tall, it is incredibly dumb that your character constantly gets stuck on them trying to walk past.). Leveling-up mechanics (skill and ability trees) and inventory management are pretty much straight from Dragon Age (and i'm sure a bunch of other much older games, but Dragon Age is the first one that comes to mind), so nothing original or unique there. I'm not exactly criticizing re-using old techniques, but just emphasizing the fact that there isn't anything ground-breaking which would make up for all the bad things. Graphics are at a World of Warcraft level. Considering how old WoW is, i'm sure that says a lot. And to top it all there are game-breaking bugs that there is no way to get around, aside from reloading a much ealier save game at the beginning of a quest line and trying again (hoping the bug won't happen again). I would have even forgiven not being able to complete that particular quest and just moving on to others, but this game didn't even let me do that - i was just stuck in one place with no ability to go anywhere. Overall - really badly made game. A 6 out of 10 at most. And if it wasn't for the slightly-above-mediocre art/music/writing, i wouldn't have given it more than 4 ouf of 10.",0,1

"The origin of addiction... One of the most fun games I've had the pleasure of enjoying and the one who threw me to the vibrant world of FPS, my favorite genre 'til this day. Now, important information: do not be fooled by the amount of hours marked by Steam. There, when the beta versions were launched in 1999, when the game was free. Then 1.6 was launched until about 4 years ago, I had it in a different account, which I do not own anymore. Over a decade of gaming, several hours every day, which certainly have accumulated thousands of hours. By far the most played game throughout my life... You see, the first sentence that illustrates this review was not chosen at random. I had to stop playing completely, cold turkey, or I would fail high school. Just decided to buy it again and play for nostalgia sake. I'm not afraid, I'm much more self controlled now and the fact that I'm not even half as good as before, kinda takes away the compulsion to play. By far the longest relationship I have ever had and we are getting back together... this is a good day.",1,0

"Great art work, story, music! More new units in this game! Also the developers did a great job in debug! Great! but..... Hard boring and wasting a lot of time upgrading soldiers! ur soldier must reach lvl 5 to achieve a higher tier, before lvl 5 ur soldiers are toys! save and reload! wasting a lot of time! u cannot enjoy a smooth game play and the story! the neutral units are blocking way everywhere and u cannot even beat them because ur toy soldiers are weak!!!! also, comptuer has greater chance to cause critical hit: kill ur soldiers in mere 1 hit!!! HAX! ( such as neutral unit Male Griffin: almost 100% critical hit is that fair??) i already said ur soldiers are toys, which means greater chance to [miss]! when fighting against neutral units! this game makes me disappointed!

Pls nerf Male Griffin  Also i need to chill........i must be responsible for my review so i came to edit this when i am chilled down &lt;My wish for this game&gt; I am a huge fun of Disciples from 1 to 3, just cannot stop playing it! but on behalf of all funs these years i have to say developers pls make ur game more epic,( not ....u k wat i say)! pls don't prolong gameplay by doing that! guys u must fix it! otherwise no one will carry on because u bored them to death. if u want ppl to say u game is good, at least ur game must give ppl the great passion to keep on! pls try XCOM enemy unknown(2k games) and see the difference....

"Playing the original  (kinda, after the mod-play anyway)  CS game in 2015 has a certain nostalgia factor, bringing back fun  (&amp; sometimes bleh)  memories for those who played and supported it during infancy. 15 years ago, I couldn't have imagined Counter-Strike becoming the competitive FPS-gaming standard that it is today, especially with its latest leap into CS:GO. (Global Offensive, even while taking changes as they come, is the new favorite goose-- Carrying the Law of Newer, Faster, Bolder-- But even there, the core CS spirit &amp; experience is true. And always slowly evolving...)   It's good to look back at how far this franchise has come, as even with each controversial change or update, I know each decision is calculated with the desire to keep moving forward-- While  (hopefully)  staying as true to it's core as possible.   LONG LIVE COUNTER-STRIKE.  &amp; LONG LIVE DIXIE MAFIA. ",1,0
I sunk an unhealthy amount of time into this game and truly enjoyed the competitive nature of it.

"The Original that started it all. V1.6 is still the best counter strike around. CS GO might have is fancy new engine,but in my opinion still does not beat this classic.I will say though at least CS: GO is better then CS: S by a small amount. This game however rolls all over CS: S and CS: GO. Call me a puriest all you want but its still damn good and has lots of mods.",1,0

Youtubers and reviews all said that multiplayer has a ton of hackers that will hurt your steam/computer and even some take out all exit functions.

Campaign is much better. Special ops is pretty fun, but it can be annoying trying to get new missions by playing the ones you hate. Overall, save the $20 and go buy Cs:go or Cod4 (which has multiplayer thats not hacked as much)",0,1

"Edit. Worth it for £5   Well, I cant really recommend this game, reason being is that it doesn't seem to engage you as much as you would like. At full price this game seems to be worth it at first but i however, lost interest about 9 hours in, you might think 9 hours thats quite engaging. Not for a game this large. The games storyline is one that is quite typical, bad guys trying to gain power and all that, i started skipping conversations with characters about 2 hours in as i thought my time was being wasted as the story wasn't thrilling, and there didn't seem to be any backbone behind it all. Combat wise its a very good game, i played a rogue type character and enjoyed most of the combat, however the enemies do seem to be repetitively used in certain areas. With no variety of enemies, you found yourself using the same tactics multiple times just because they were most effective. Its a slick game that has great combat elements and a broad choice of combat styles but its not entertaining enough to keep you in",0,1

"So far I honestly regrett having bought this game. It's just unnatural. Starts with the default key bindings which are far off from what the average FPS is using: Zooming in is done with 'e', a melee attack by clicking the mouse wheel, the powers use awkward keys. There is no sprint, you get slightly faster additionally when slowing down time, but energy recovery is far too slow. On 'Skilled', it takes up to three shots with a shotgun to the head if they enemy's wearing a helmet. I fire away an entire mag with the assault rifle to the body. Luckily you get a lot of ammo, however you still heavily depend on using your time shifting abilities. But as said, the energy recovers way too slowly for such a heavy use.  You don't get any information on who you are are what the ♥♥♥♥ even happened. You suddenly appear in 1939 of an alternative world where a high tech civil uprising takes place instead of WWII. It's just your standard, linear, straight-forward FPS with special abilities in which difficulty doesn't mean a more human-like AI, but rougher enemies with increased health and armor and more bullets for you to take. As always, you're the uber-soldier, although I had the impression that actually you're a ♥♥♥♥ing scientist... since when can I, as a scientist, remorselessly kill people and even fire a damn gun so precisely?!

Great game. Terrible port. Don't waste your money.,0,1
"Bought this game after getting an itch for a new RPG. A lot of the game reminded me of Dark Souls, since the combat was pretty unforgiving and required precise timing. You cannot hack and slash your way through the game, which I liked.   However, if a game is going to be unforgiving, I am going to be the same way towards its polish. KoA has some pretty bad camera work that make timing the perfect dodge or counter attack near impossible once an enemy dashes behind you. The direction your character attacks is also subject to this issue. Spent far longer than I should have on some fights purely because the camera disagreed with me all too regularly.  The quests have the depth of your average MMO (go kill X enemy type, fetch Y item for me). I simply ran out of reasons to push forward through the game and was too frustrated by its problems.  The game also doesn't come with any options menu of any depth, if that's important to you. It feels very much like a mediocre (but not terrible) console port.  Unless you have a strong desire for a tough RPG, I would stay away. If you happen to really love those types of games, you may be able to push through the issues.",0,1

"As a huge fan of Western RPGs, I thought I would love Kingdoms of Amalur. It seems to have a lot of positive reviews. However, I'm four hours into the game and still don't feel that compelled to keep playing it.  Here are the reasons I don't really like the game: 1. The voice acting is pretty bad 2. I find the main story and the characters boring 3. Gameplay has been laughably easy so far 4. It doesn't compare favourably to Skyrim, Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights, Divinity etc. - just so many elements that are not as good. It doesn't have the atmosphere of a lot of these games.  I've pretty much given up on it, which is a shame as it was £20.",0,1

"There's some good stuff here, interesting characters, and setting thanks to the novel it's based. I would say it's better than the film of that novel, which can be seen on youtube, but it's all so very slow, the hotel is quite large and as soon as your character gets to one end of it, he's sent back to the other. Also there are too many puzzles and tasks which don't actually require any puzzling.

In what game are you gonna kill zombies, while they run at full speed and all your teammates throw granades and shoot as if there was no tommorow? In what game are you gonna surf on wall?

"Originally, i wrote a positive review. in hindsight, ive since deleted it.  Sure, MW2 is one of the best CoD games ever created, but the game was released in 2009. its now 2014, so the graphics and gameplay are seriously outdated, and there is now zero support from IW. yet Steam still charges the retail $89.99 for the game.  I PAID THAT UPON RELEASE!  there is zero justification to pay this much, especially considering the community has dwindled exponentially, and moved on to MW3, BOPS, Ghosts etc.  even on special at the moment for $49.99 there is still zero justification to pay so much for a game that is so old. honestly? you would be better off buying CoD4 and have the joy of private servers.  it makes me sad to not recommend this game, but with the blatant price gouging by both Steam and Activision, there really isnt a choice. i just hope this review will stop alot of people wasting their hard earned money that will offer a sub-par experience at best.  off the top of my head, i can think of a dozen games that are more worthy of your hard earned $$",0,1

"Hey it is finally on steam! This game will likely get low scores and upset fanboys because it comes accross as a parody of itself. Anyways: It is a Third Person action game with tons of random and sick humor in small mission based levels.   The method you use to solve the missions are very limited compared to Postal 2 because either you do things in a evil way or a good way... how you do the missions results in what type of mission you do next.   You could play the whole game killing everyone and getting evil missions or as a cop doing good things and saving people. The whole game has alternative pathways so since I did a good guy, I missed at least 1/3 of the game of bad guy levels.  The weapons are fun and killing people is fun, but overall the game feels rushed and humor is forced. Not worth the $40.00, but I could say it would be worth $20.00 if you love sick humor and killing people with strange weapons like killer Cats.",1,0

"Prototype is an action-adventure open world game. You are Alex Mercer, a man without memory armed with amazing superhuman powers and the option to go most anywhere you like and do most anything you want once you get there. A virus outbreak has claimed Manhattan, forcing the island into a military quarantine. The infected citizens turning the population into mutants. The main story path is entirely linear. The missions are a sloppy mix of poorly paced ideas. Long missions involve simply going from one end of Manhattan to the other, while some of the short missions are climactic sieges and battles. Missions can be brutally challenging, often because of the uncooperative auto-lock system. Boss battles are much longer than they need to be and more often test your endurance rather than your skill. As you work your way through the game, you will earn experience points that can be used to unlock new and ever more exotic powers. Experience points are also the only thing you get by finding collectibles. The graphics are not the best, buildings and environments are ugly, so the world is not a place you want to explore.  All in all, the awful boring and repeating missions and linear gameplay ruins the overall experience.

"It used to be fun when I played multiplayer with my friends but the game itself isn't fun.  The multiplayer is unbalanced, full of immateur idiots and lacks variety (by saying that I mean community made maps, mods and etc.) it only has few maps and it isn't fun to play most of them. To get few more maps and gamemodes, you have to buy expansion packs for ridiculous price and the game itself has ridiculous price.   The singleplayer isn't very good too. Its story is naive and illogical. It would look interesting probably only for 8 year old children.  There are only few things in this game that are fun but you shouldn't buy it for such price. There are more much cheaper, more interesting and more balanced first person shooters to buy.",0,1

"At first I was looking forward to some good old Disciples after the years, thinking there will be some innovative touch here and there. What awaited me, though, was one big unbalanced mess.   For one, interface and new approach to castles we already know and love were steps in the right direction. Also the new approach to the character upgrades with some minor boosts to troops pleasantly surprised me. On the other hand, the battle-system is maybe the most broken one I've encountered to date. I don't know if I somehow played it wrong (but considering I've read through tutorials and such, I think it wasn't my fault after all), but battles were just lenghty, repetitive chore. In every and each one of them you need to have one hell of luck on your side, because enemies are 'tough'. And the reason for quation marks is simple. I thought maybe I just chose bad enemies for the beginning of a map. Then I realized it's the same story with every enemy unit I attack, not only you have to pray so your troops actually hit something every now and then, but also you have to deal with the illusion of some strategy on that little Heroes rip-off action map. I understand that change is very important part in everything, but for the God's sake don't change that one kind of unique thing, which was perfectly functional, simple yet fun to play with.  To summarize it, I wouldn't recommend this to anybody, especially not to the Disciples fans. Good idea killed by totally non-functional battle-system.",0,1
Its a Pay-to-Win (like some call of duty games) It focuses on female character boob physics lacking the budget for better graphics and hacking prevention. Its....Kinda bland.

"I haven't purchased a game with the EA logo on it since BF1942 due to their underhanded practices, but a friend highly recommended this game and even paid for it. With that disclaimer out of the way, on to the review.  Overall appearance: 5/10. Standard, generic, fly by night MMO look throughout the game. It is vastly empty, with very specific paths to follow. This is reinforced with invisible walls everywhere which prevent you from doing the simplest of tasks like jumping over a log. This kind of unpolished short cut methodology is fine for F2P MMOs, but not for a single player game. The armor sets are frequently reused, so you can have 3 or 4 different sets, yet they all look identical. The developers didn't even take the extra day to retexture the pieces for each set.  Combat mechanics: 1/10. This game has hands down, the absolute worst combat mechanics I have ever witnessed in any game. Even Revelation 2012 was better in this regard. You go to attack a specific enemy, and are instantly, uncontrollably attacking something completely different. This can include other monsters, but also can include a rock wall, the ground, or even nothing at all. This unpolished, wonky mess of a system can and will get you killed by bosses over and over.  Camera movements: 2/10. You have no control whatsoever of the bouncy, rubber banding camera, which frequently pops underground and into trees and rocks during fights so you can't see what's going on. If you suffer from motion sickness, take your pills before attempting to play.  Questing contents: 8/10. There is a lot to do in this game. Nearly town NPC will have some kind of quest chain for you to accomplish. Not just one Fed Ex quest, but actual, multiple leg quests. This is a nice thing to see in this day and age of single mission, gofer quests that most games offer. This doesn't allow for a great deal of replayability though, since the quests and dialogue are identical regardless of character build.  In general, this game feels just like any other fly by night MMO, with the one exception that there is no one else around. The armor sets leave a lot to be desired, using the same pieces for several different versions. And with the horrendous camera whizzing around all over the place, along with your character randomly attacking whatever the game decides it should, make this an exercise in patience more than something fun to do. Even on sale, it's not worth it.  While there were a number of high profile names associated with this title, it is painfully obvious they were merely lounging while resting on their laurels as a handful of under skilled interns developed the game. Many cardinal sins were incorporated along the way, and while I really wanted to like the game, in the end just couldn't. If I wanted to pay money for this kind of frustration, I'd get back together with my ex.",0,1

It's extremely linear and the 'free roam' maps are small as hell. when you initially play, your like wtf did I just play, but then, you play the good side of the story. -- I even hate to say this but the good story version of the game seemed to be more of a overall game, even the boss fights were actually boss fights to an extent...    (the ending was actually pretty epic with the tank battle)     The fact that this alone allows you to draw out the gameplay factor a bit does kind of give it a replay value... Kind Of....

Only game mode played is TDM, which id ont mind but it sucks when you try to get into the foray only to be shot in the back by a guy corner camping. Oh and no lean ability, Infinity Ward removed it because a minority of the gaming community hated it cause the campers couldnt camp with it. Unbalanced perks, weapons and equipment like the UMP45 getting a massive boost with the suppressor and OMA giving unlimited grenade ammo for the noob tube and such. Hacking is still present though most people using it will hide it by pulling it out limitedly and the fact that VAC no longer bans players from the game which basically makes the game now garbage. Hosting is archaic with having a player host in a sort of LAN based gaming which you dont control, its like console gaming on a PC. If you have latency to the host expect to lose alot of .. everything gunfights, matches and basically even when you shoot guys in the back expect that to fail when it doesnt register and you still die. Even being host doesnt guarantee anything since you can still lag when hosting too. No control over the game, no lean ability, no hacker counter equals a game that can still be fun when played with none of the above stuff but when there are hackers and such expect a broken match and to top if off if you leave it will count as a loss and then they will toss you right back into the same match as icing on the cake.",0,1

"A.V.A is not fun. First of all, there are only four gamemodes that aren't even different from eachother! Voice acting is terrible. Gameplay is terrible.

"I don't know exactly why the three hours I played this game felt like three weeks, but it did, and it wasn't fun. It might be the MMO world which de-emphasizes any build-up to an interest in the story, or it might be that most of the NPCs have a large list of pointless conversation pieces telling me the exact same thing that another NPC just told me (none of which matter or are interesting). It might also be because when they introduce an NPC with some amount of potential, like Agarth, he just sends me on an errand and sits back. I do know that some degree of the not-fun has to do with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Skyrim-esque skills, which are neither fun nor intuitive - I'd rather not put points in lockpick because I'd rather never have to do it. Also, how do you farm an herb and get zero materials? Am I eating the plants as I'm farming them? Am I farming them with a flamethrower and rendering them unusable? Talk about unsatisfying.  Either way, the game emphasized all the negative aspects of an MMO - grinding and pointless fighting, uninspired dungeon design (because, again, it is endless hack and slash, not anything inventive), a story that felt both non-urgent and uninteresting, and a host of mini-game mechanics, like a dumbed down lockpicking mechanic, that make the game more laborious than fun.  If you wanna play an MMO, just choose one of the free ones with an interesting story or mechanics (at least in an MMO I have abilities to spice up combat). There just isn't much reason to play this compared to what else is out there.",0,1

"It's not even worth buying it. Even though there is custom maps, no one really plays it alot.

I just have to spam the refresh list on Co-Op to see if anyone plays. AND MOST OF THEM ARE CUSTOM MAPS! IT TAKES A WHILE TO DOWNLOAD DUDE! Why can't you just host the original maps? I know the Mods feature was big, but everytime I would download a map, the Lobby would disappear cause it's been canceled! I mean like, Vanoss and other gamers play the game, why isn't there more people than expected? Even though PunkBuster no longer supports the PC version of this game, you can still host games! Why doesn't anyone even play it? Multiplayer is the only gamemode with enough people but what about nazi zombies? I've recently played this game and all I mostly see is custom maps instead of Regular maps. ",0,1

"An okay tower defense game. Gets boring very quickly, but to be honest I really dislike the genre, hence why I might be prejudiced. If you like tower defenses, ignore my review, otherwise I recommend to pass on this one. It's just building traps and watching enemies walk into them and die. Sure, the game provides some challenge, but the gameplay itself is just setting up traps as quickly as possible and shooting some enemies from time to time.",1,0

This is a very fun game if you can find some friends to play with. There are a lot of servers with custom content such as models or even game modes that completely change the game. Even though it's old there are still active servers with plenty of players on them. It's very easy to make a custom map if you wish to play one. Only bad thing is that the graphics and models are not that great. Also most servers are in spanish,1,0

"I really wanted to like this game,but there are just to many flaws for it to be good.  Textures that overlap, feet that go through the ground. Plus the fact you cant zoom the camera out or change your FoV but during combat sometimes the camera will swing way out and then back in for no apperent reason. The game has interface lag. And even with all the eye candy turned on this game really doesnt look that great(in context for the year it came out). It reminds me of WoW which isnt saying much. The story is somewhat interesting but the side quests are boring and some are downright tedious. The combat system has potential to but is let down by a poorly thought out skill system and all the other issues I previously mentioned.  Its to bad. The game has a ton of potential, but in typical EA style , it feels like a cheap take on a great idea. A game is rushed out ASAP with no concern for being above average.",0,1

"Not recommended. I keep getting fooled by EA games. It's a fun premise, with lots of other people giving it great reviews.  Some obvious short comings is resolution is capped at 720p, and cut scene audio isn't ported out correctly (you can change the latency in which audio comes in, which means unsynced audio/audio plays faster than the video in cut scenes). It's pretty bad, even for a 5 year old game - EA always does ports, and they've always turned out unpolished.   Maximum AA is 2x, and in all honesty, the graphics are horrendous for a 2009 game. This looks like it was based on the first generation half life engine.   All in all tho, the story has potential, as well as the game play (game play/controls/movement is not fluid), and the beginning tutorial is kind of useless as... you have to redo another tutorial anyways. The biggest appeal to me, is like all the other reviewers said - you are an over powered beast capable of rampaging through everywhere. The terrible port of cutscenes detracts from the otherwise good story line, and the controls are pretty bad (eg: i'm standing over a gun, I press the 'grab' button, and he lunges in the air hoping to grapple a non-existent target instead of the gun he's standing on top of. Problem is, his lunge moves him forward, meaning i have to reposition him per failed grab. Ugh)  I don't recommend this EA port of a game, at all. Frustrating, perhaps console version is better",0,1

"Seinfeld is an American sitcom that originally ran for nine seasons on NBC, from 1989 to 1998. It was created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, the latter starring as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly in an apartment building in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City (although taped entirely in Los Angeles), the show features a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, particularly best friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards). It is often described as being 'a show about nothing', as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life. ",1,0

You can roll out of the way but still get hit. But your gear will by mitigating so much damage that you can just tank everything even as a caster. One hit bosses totally possible because the side-quest will over level you. The game is 70% travelling, 20% mowing down boring enemies and 10% skipping mundane dialogue. If you want lots of mediocre content for cheap, this game is great on sale. Can't recommend though.",0,1

"Counter-Strike - a series of computer games in the genre of team first-person shooter based on the engine GoldSource, originally appeared as a modification of Half-Life games.  You have to compare, so this game I will compare with СS: Source and CS: Global Offensive    Pros:    1. Battle PVP.   The multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential of the idea of the game. The most interesting part of this is. Under the bot can already tune in, but not in the real players. They can deceive, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes.   2. The atmosphere and realism.   In all games, Valve is always a great atmosphere and I was impressed. It is evident that the developers have tried to do everything in this game, as in real life. For example, the sounds. Unfortunately, Valve released a patch in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with new sounds and they made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.       Minuses:    1. Cheaters.   Well, as without these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s? These sons of dogs prevent us from playing. Creators of cheats have always been one step ahead of the creators of the VAC anti-cheat. Valve is trying to improve its anti-cheat and have it turns out.I say that Valve do nothing, not worth it.   2.Graphic arts.   She was good at Counter-Strike as long as did not come out Source. I'm not picky about graphics, but after 30 minutes I start to hurt your eyes. Yes, and in general, this game proved to all that the graphics in games are not the most important thing.   3.Termination of support.   All good things always come to an end, and Counter-Strike is not an exception. The game goes more and more players, server empty.More Valve does not release an update for Counter-Strike and does not support it in e-sports.     Conclusion:     Despite the fact that in this game there are downsides, even if they have, but still this game is legendary.  If you ask me, as you Counter-Strike, the fond memories flooding back me, maybe I can cry .Game, which was able to give me a lot of positive emotions..  ",1,0
"This was pretty confusing, I wound up having to track down a walkthrough pretty quickly. Voices are okay but direction is not - you coud tell they were just reading what they were given with no context. Some more $$ thrown into localization would've helped. Maybe other languages are better.   Apparently this is based off of a novel. Maybe reading that first would've helped make the game more sense, but playing this first makes me completely uninterested in trying to find the novel.",0,1

"Alliance of Valiant Arms was an enjoyable game before Aeria Games came along. These new operators installed pay2win mechanics and microtransactions everywhere. Even when you do pay real money for a weapon it's now only for a limited time. Seriously. You don't even get to keep the items you pay REAL MONEY for.  I'd recommend this game if you could go back in time to before Aeria Games took over, but since that seems very unlikely this one is a big no-no for me.   the free tf2 knife is nice though",0,1

"If you get the collection with all the DLC and such, be aware that the Weapons and armor bundle is 100% worthless. That DLC give you weapons/armor at the level of the first character you play. So it all spawns at level 1 and is ineffective by level 5-10.   The game has the least interesting story possible, you don't need to read anything. I honestly don't know what the game is even getting at and I am pretty far in I think.   I feel compelled to finish the game just because I have invested so much time already.  The fighting is ok, nothing to write home about.  I struggle with whether or not to recommend this, but I am going NO simply because it is an MMORPG, without the MMO. (So it is just an RPG? No, seriously, if you've played an MMORPG like wow where it is like 'Go here get this come back' it is identical to that)",0,1

" PROS:  + great gameplay + big active community + great choice of weapons + huge amount of mods + lots of community created maps, weapons, AI, soundtracks, etc.   CONS:  - rare issues with graphic cards (especially for laptops) - has replacement in form of newer CS games   Comment:  What is there to introduce? This is a FPS game that most gamers know and the ones that don't should. The laughable half an hour I have displayed here was just testing out the newly bought game. In reality I have played many many many hours with my friends. I played it in high school. I played it in college. I played it with friends after work. While the graphics may be old and this game replaced by its' younger sibblings it still holds out the test of time. While I am no longer able to get my friends together and play this , this game will always be a fond memory for me. And who knows maybe I will pick it up some day again. What I can do is recommend this game to anyone who has not played it or people who are thinking about pruchasing this digital copy. The basic concept of terrorists vs. counter-terrorists is really fun and with the modding community the amount of variation is almost limitless. So grab it if you can, it is very much worth it.",1,0

"  This game is horrible.    And when I say horrible, I mean literally the worst game I have ever played, in my entire life. Node graph errors occur every time you play this game, and you will always expect some sort of graphical issue when playing this title. Akella has ruined the macabre concept of the Postal Dude, getting a new voice actor, and removing jumping and replacing it with a faulty cover system.  Hell, the only way to have fun in this game is heavily mod it. The only realistic model in this game is of Postal Dude, with every single civilian appearing to be a cartoon character from a Disney film. Commanding Champ to take out enemies just straight up doesn't work, you are better off using the helper monkey which appears literally once in the game. The third person view is not that bad, but then you realize Akella probably did that to make the Postal series more like a GTA clone.   The whole good/bad paths in the game do not mean anything. In a game where you can amputate a mans arm, throw it at another person, all while urinating on them, the game punishes you severely for doing anything close to bad. And if you select the good path, the game is no fun, whatsoever. Nobody confronts you (except Osama Bin Laden) and because the game is on rails, being wanted by the police means nothing. There isn't even a system that allows you to know you are wanted, you just do soemthing, and every single officer unloads on you. To make that worse, you can't evade them until you die.  The high note in this game is the weapons. I mean, a badger on a stick that you can have maul people to death, it's crazy. Krotchy doll nukes, the shop-vac, all were great ideas, but had a very poor execution.  The demo shown in 2007 had better graphics, gameplay, and overall feel than this game. At best, this is something a college student would make in Unity3D. 3.5/10  ",0,1

"Initially this was a good game... no really- it was. I Mean who doesn't enjoy dropkicking helicopters to death in a 'free roam' environment. between a massive slew of unlockable powers and movement mechanics, some really stylish animation, and overall addictive gameplay- this game has a lot going for it. However, between a thin story (It could've been a lot better if there was just more character depth) and some maddeningly bad boss fights *cough* elizabeth green *cough* and the abysmel slew of bugs that invariably result in stunlocks and instant death- the latter parts of the game will probably leave you feeling like you should go play contra to unwind. for a game released in 2009 to have so many weird bugs is. well... not so great. Especially from a publishler like activision. Still the bugs arn't so bad as to completely ruin the game. All in all i'd give it a 6 out of 10. The animators did great, the graphics, for the time, are OK. (Would be better if not clearly aimed at consoles) the story and gameplay itself could be a little more solid. Still worth buying if you catch it on sale, but be prepared to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at a couple poorly designed boss fights, the ocassional unavoidable stunlock, enemies running around at mach 12, and the autotargetting system leaving you spinning in circles at 90mph.",1,0

"Postal 3, a third sequel to the cult classic, POSTAL franchise. This game, developed by Akella, NOT Running With Scissors - sees the Postal Dude rigth after a Nuclear Bomb goes off in the previous city, crosses a zombie infested bridge and is now forced to find a job in a new city, Catharsis, where a matter of chaotic events occur.  The game features a branching Storyline System ala Mass Effect's Paragon system, but more black and white with it's execution, it does make the game differ greatly with it's content and is a highly welcome addition imo - the rest of the game however... is terrible. It is a third person shooter that barely plays at all, it was built on Valve's Source Engine way back in the day, this game pretty much controls terribly and loosely, has music falling out of loops, AI bugging out occasionally and much more that just scream unfinished.  I should mention I do enjoy this game for what it is (a fan of the POSTAL franchise and the kind of macabre humor it uses) but from extremely buggy set pieces (Doors closing on you halting chapter progress.), horrible performance issues (Game is NOT enabled to properly run on Multi Core PCs and PhysX feature do a LOT more harm than good), spotty AI and just overall terrible loose mechanics, the game is most definately a skip to those whom are not willing to put up with the game;s shortcoming - those being dang near everything else - considering the game is buggy to the point of it being borderline unplayable.",0,1

"Average - with both good and poor features, showing a lack of cohesion in design. Incredibly simple Combat, Horrendous choices that do nothing in the profession system, superb voice acting completly at odds with the character appearances, laughable npc animations and a maguffin story that can be said in 4 words. This game 'boasts' 200 hours of gameplay but doing any % of sidequests means you'll one shot most enimies on the hardest difficulty. The Main Quest is about 15-20 hours. I think considering the amount of enemy types (9) it's still strecthing it a bit long. The redeeming features are phenominal music, lovely backdrops and varied sidequests. If you like Tolkien-esque fantasy in a Fable clone, pick it up - if it's on sale.",0,1

"Got this game when I bought my new laptop in order to bring back good memories. However, as expected there's only small community of players left meaning that there are mainly only games in TDM,S&amp;D,HC-TDM &amp; FFA.

"One of the most unoptimized PC games ever made. It crashes, it freezes, and it stutters, constantly. Even with user-created .cgf files, Postal III is guaranteed to be a frustrating technical challenge for even the most stacked high-end computer.  The developers went belly up shortly after the game was released, and it's not hard to understand why after playing just a few minutes of this atrocious excuse for code. Even worse, the publisher has disavowed Postal III completely, and they refuse to fix it or improve it in any way, shape, or form.  Not only is Postal III a buggy piece of crap, it fares no better gameplay-wise. Despite being an open-world game, the story forces you down a particular path, and you aren't allowed to free roam until you've completed all the missions. The weapons suck, the graphics suck, the environments suck, the sound effects suck. Absolutely everything about Postal III sucks. You're better off going with Postal 2 -- it's cheaper and it actually runs properly.  Screw the developers and the publisher of this digital abortion. They should have known better.",0,1

"To be totally honest, this game is not worth the money. Even on sale it's not worth it at all. The multiplayer is FULL of hackers. The only thing that's fun is the campain and the special ops but that can only last you so long. You join a game in multiplayer and you get all this op stuff... It takes away the fun and experience in leveling up. So you should hold on to your money and wait for another game you want to go on sale. Hope this helped '')",0,1

"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.  Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.  Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.    [The legendary FPS, till this day its still being played quite actively, 'old but gold' is the only thing that applies here. You either win by teaming up or you'll be clutching the rounds, the game that'll take some time to become good at and will never feel like you've wasted your time as you can always continue learning and becoming better.]",1,0

"CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best  game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.  It starts off with a team trying to kill another team.   I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.  Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.  When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.  CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.  Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.  In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).",1,0

"An interesting freeroam game, with a good idea and interesting story. Those who like free roam games will like it. Overall it's good. But the story is full of clichés, the combat system is too console like, and resembles the Force Unleashed (I just beat before this game). The same targeting, health gain system and even you have unlockables, and upgrades (not really combos). The NPC characters start to look the same after a while. I was somwhere in the middle of the story or at the first third, when I totally lost my interest. Nor the story, neither the game style couldn't get me back to the game.",1,0

Any way if you good at counter strike game it is fun if not deinstall game because if you're bad at game you are bad. Overall great game but also bad. Yes thank for read!

"i was told this game was similar to the infamous series and while they werent wrong, it feels like activision just played infamous and tried to make a knockoff version of it. both games were made during the same year and yet prototype feels cheap and lazy with the graphics of something id expect to see on a much older console. There's no atmosphere and the main character is very two demensional with the sole goal to kill everyone that experimented on him.",0,1
Nice Game =D,1,0

"Where to even begin. This game is a narrative trainwreck, which sucks because a lot of it has so much potential that you can see rotting on the vine.  First off, this game doesn't handle multiple monitors very well. I've had to turn off my side 2 through nVidia control panel to make it play nice. Every time the game starts up, it opens a little pop up saying I've got incompatible drivers and sends me to nvidia's homepage to download the latest drivers which I already have. Older game, hard to program forward compatibility, but whatever, I can deal with that. Not impressed, but not enough to kill it either.  Gameplay: This is a generic linear corridor shooter with a gimmick of limited time control. You can slow time down, stop time and reverse time. And that's about it. It's not even as much fun as it sounds. What would have been more interesting is an open level approach with multiple solutions, instead of forcing the player down a single path and having the only option to be to shoot everyone. The time control features are introduced within 5 minutes of the opening level, and other than some weapons, that’s about it. The weapons themselves tend to flip flop between underpowered pea-shooter and BFG9000. There’s no character customization, only about 6 weapons total, a few have some alt-fire which is easily ignored and forgotten. A better way of doing this would be a leveling system that lets the player choose how they want to accomplish their objectives: perhaps some would like to do things stealthy, others like the time manipulation tools, still others prefer to load up on heavy armor, big guns, and shoot friends and foes alike until there’s nothing left but smoking ash. Some variety.   The AI is forgettable. They mostly just stand there, or get into poor cover while shouting about what kind of gun you have, request reinforcements, or repeat the same few canned lines again and again and again. They make up for their stupidity in sheer numbers and by killing you in a few shots.  Story wise, don’t even bother. You’re dropping into an alternate timeline around 1939, but might as well be 2100 with all the future tech running around. There’s the generic evil empire vs the good rebels, but I constantly found myself asking “Who are these people and why should I care about any of this.” You see some of the present in flashbacks, but don’t expect it to answer any questions. It might have raised a few questions, but by then I didn’t even care.   Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Deus Ex or Dishonored instead.",0,1
"What a piece of crap. It seems almost everyone who recommends this game is 100% nostalgia blind. Firstly dont bother with the piece of ♥♥♥♥ storyline that is so dry you could snort it, lets talk about the multiplayer, which consists of: run into a room, shoot, repeat.

This game could be really good &amp; fun to play but unfortunate there is so many bugs in this game that it's simply not possible to complete all missions in the game (without getting hugs bugs there affects your game)  110 hours have i now played and restarted about 10 times! and this is serious too much for me so i cannot recommend this game at all.,0,1
"Let me go on record to say that this game is fun. It has some good gamemodes, some good combat, and overall, it's a very good counter-strike knockoff. then the problems start. First: this game installs a keylogger. THAT'S ♥♥♥♥ING RIGHT. IT INSTALLS A 3RD-PARTY KEYLOGGER FOR ANTI-CHEAT MEASURES. It's also nearly impossible to remove, unless you extremely specifically remove something from System32, then from Regedit, but i'm not even going to try. Second: The company that  made  bought the rights to this game filled it up with weapons that you have to buy for... with real. world. money. Here's the best part: the weapons have better stats, but disappear from your inventory after a while. You know what that means? A Paytowin FPS. Even if they didn't have other stats, they're just retextures of other items, for example, you could have a normal smoke grenade, or get a colored one for an additional fee. Personally, i only installed this to get the black rose in TF2, but found myself playing it more than expected. I uninstalled it several months ago, and just now found out about the keylogger.   DON'T INSTALL THIS GAME. NOT EVEN FOR THE BLACK ROSE. IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK.  ",1,0

Controller support is lousy, surprising for a console port. If it had straight up no-hassle 360 controller support I would'nt be complaining, and I'd still have this installed. You can force it to read your input via a console command but there's no vibration, rendering it pointless, if you ask me.  The russian campaign and zombie mode are the best this thing has to offer.

"I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that.",1,0
"Most think CS was released in 2000. It actually was released on june 19, 1999 (before HL: opposing force) as a GoldSrc mod for free. Later when Gooseman joined valve it was released as a retail game for about 10 dollars. Overall you cannot deny the fact that CS was one of the best games of all time and in my opinion it is slightly better than GO but that's my opinion.",1,0

"I really wanted to like this game and while I enjoyed the first quarter of it, the game quickly became lackluster. There was so much potential staring me right in the face but the lack of polish and variety ultimately made for a rather boring experience. Numerous times through the game I couldn't help but think that the producers, having probably spent a large portion of the budget to bring in McFarlane for concept art; Salvatore for story writing; and voice actors for all of the dialog, were demanding unrealistic publish dates that forced the developers into a tough position. The world wasn't immersive enough, the combat encounters were way too repetative due to painfully small monster variety, the itemization was awful... during the last quarter of the game I stopped openning chests and looting bodies completely because I never found upgrades anyway, and the level design felt unnecessarily drawn out or repetative in many ways.  Ultimately, this game shows that a lot of quality work went into conceiving a game that would have been amazing to play, deeply immersive, and with many novel concepts, but somewhere in the process of development a line was drawn and deep concessions were made. Evidence that the games' potential was never realized is staring you in the face from start to finish. It is a shame really.",0,1

"The Story:   I found out about this game after doing some late night googling on Salvatore. 20 years ago I started reading his books and was amazed that I completely missed the fact that he worked on a game and it immediately went on my wishlist. The main story was okay, I don't really have any complaints but I didn't really feel any Salvatore coming through and I am unmoved. Anyone could have written/helped write the world and I wouldn't know any difference.   The Art:   Simultaneously I found out Todd Mccfarlane had some play in the art and I have an entire box of Spawn comics. My favorite childhood artist and writer together for one game, holy ♥♥♥♥. The color is great in the game but the lack of detail is mind boggling. Todd put so much detail into spawn comics and seeing character models without fingernails was just disgraceful. The graphics and animations are rather plain and nothing here is an artistic achievement. At one cutscene I recall a female soldier being shot in the back with an arrow and I think they tried to animate blood coming out of her mouth but it just looked like it was pouring out her face. Mediocrity is the theme for the art.   The Gameplay:   Through and through this is a single-player MMO action rpg. You could take any free to play mmo, remove the multiplayer and nothing about this game would outshine any of the uncountable amounts of games in the genre. Pretty much each zone has a town, each town has npcs with exclamation marks giving out fetch and kill quests. Each zone is linked together by a passage. There are basic tradeskills with the classic WoW style herb gathering, jewelcrafting , blacksmithing (except the last two you get regeants from chests and not nodes) and you don't need to invest in any of them although healing potions are the end all-most powerful item in the game as you can just spam them like Diablo 1. The skilltrees are decent, on par with something like diablo 2. The combat is mediocre to bad for an action game but better than an RPG like Skyrim. The main storyline is about 12 hours long and 'literally' 70% of the time you will be walking from one point to another like a really bad mmo, 20% of the time you will sit in inconsequential conversations and 10% fighting. The final boss was terribly boring/uninspiring/unchallenging and the entirety of the game was not challenging except at one point my main quest enemies became red (as opposed to neutral level enemies that are yellow, just like any mmo) and they were mostly unkillable. I went back to the surface leveled twice off yellow monsters (the 'open world' monsters scale to your level) came back and walked through the rest of the game without even trying.   Verdict:  Theres a lot of game here.. You could put 200 hours into fetch and kill quests if you wanted to and you can respec your skills as much as you want. If you (like me) have a history of playing mmos and you have no desire to grind out fetch quests ever again for the rest of your life just avoid this less than mediocre ftp-single player-mmo action game. If you have never played an mmo, or you love fetch and kill quests this game is ripe with them for many many hours.",0,1

My reaction? Not great...  First the technical difficulties with this game were overwhelming. The camera itself seems to have the most issues. The positioning of it is downright terrible. It really does take a lot out of the game when you have difficulty seeing the enemies or even moving efficiently. Despite it's age this has not been fixed through a patch so I was forced to download third party software in order to play the game. Next the game is actually fairly unstable. Even before I downloaded the fix it would crash frequently. It seems like the game was released too soon and then not supported. Really upsetting.  I had a lot of difficulties actually getting into this game at first. The gameplay is not very gripping even as far as RPG's go. The game also seems rather directionless. Not to mention the world you play in lacks almost all description of itself. You're required to assume things from context for a variety of the different storylines. This is especially true for the lore mechanics. I found the elves songs difficult to understand at first. Later I found out they're kind of like events that repeat themselves for some reason.  ,0,1

"(I've deleted all the comments on this because I wanted to give a serious review about this game and delete my older one, so here ya go)  This is the older Counter-Strike as most people know it. Some people usually don't find enjoyment in playing it due to it being either 'out-dated' or 'glitchy'. I personally tend to enjoy this game from time to time because it's an original game made from the first Source engine, and old school shooters in general ain't too shabby either. Due to the game having a small amount of space to fill in your computer, it rarely ever lags, which makes sure of no interruptions to your enjoyment. It's also just as Competitive as the present Counter-Strike games, though there isn't any seperate Comp gamemode, unfortunately. But that's something that Valve decided to save for later purposes I suppose. Still the King of FPS Games (IMO), I would definetely recommend playing this if you enjoy tactical teamwork in your Online Gaming.",1,0

"Starts off strong but quickly loses its allure. The combat is fun and unique at first, but the inability to switch weapons mid-combo removes absolutely any level of depth. The combat wants to be Devil May Cry, but it's like they forgot to finish programming the combat half-way through.   The characters are entirely unlikeable, and the game tries to force-feed you lore through them at any moment that it possibly can. The story's forgettable, especially when you stop and think, 'Why am I helping these people again? I don't like them.'  The world is technically 'open', but the leveled mobs may as well make it entirely linear on that front. As well, there's really no point in the world being open, since past the vistas that they front-load into every new area, the world feels completely dead and drab.   The game also lacks a deal good deal of polish in certain areas. As an example, if you're using a ranged weapon and fighting an enemy who is uphill from you, you will attack the ground in front of you instead of attacking towards the enemy that you're targeting. Often, when this happens, your attacks will fly through the ground and clip out of bounds until the animation finishes.   Ultimately, Kingdoms of Amalur, falls short everywhere that it had potential to shine. If you can get it cheap(and I mean really cheap) and you're willing to overlook a good deal of flaws, it may be worth your time.",0,1

"Great game, tons of fun when I played it a long time ago on a rig with Windows Vista. But if you have Windows 7 or later, forget about this game because it will be nothing but god awful trouble getting it to run, which is why I voted to not recommend it. If you do, have a xbox 360 controller to play this because if you use a mouse and keyboard it stutters horribly. If you have Win7 or higher, go for Prototype 2. And use a wired xbox 360 controller for that too because using keyboard and mouse also causes stuttering in that game as well.",0,1

"Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has the same pitfalls as most modern day RPGs. There is a massive player world with dozens and dozens of side quests, but the immersion factor is sorely missing. I ended up with the same problem I had when I played most of the Elder Scrolls series. My character became too powerful from pursuing all of the side quests, and nothing in the game was a challenge anymore. Add to that the fact that I reached a roadblock in the main quest which involved a dungeon that took more than five minutes to walk back through because of a missing item that I could not find, and there was not enough enjoyment here to keep me happy. The game seems more like work than play. It was very unenjoyable.   I put in over 40 hours, and I am done. I think my save is bugged, and I'm not willing to start over. Suffice it to say that I won't be completing this one. I can't recommend it for the same reasons that I can't recommend any of the Elder Scrolls games. It's too ambitious with no grounding. The story isn't interesting, and the levelling is lacks excitement. I give this one about a 3 on a 10 scale.",0,1

"In the good day of ijji, this game was the best free-to-play fps on the market. Unfortunatly, the compagny gone bankrupt and this game is now manage by aeria wich is the one of the worst money-hungry publisher on the planet.  The bad: All weapon used to be permanant, wich was nice for a free-to-play game, aeria changed that. GIVE US PERM WEAPON BACK! There used to be an update every month, now its more like every holiday. It cost around $200~300 to get some weapons with the tired spender program, wich is too much. Servers are crap and I get net lag even with 5~10 ping Game moderators are mostly absent and support is bad with at best copy/paste robot response. Most weapon you can buy with in-game currency got nerfed over time. Broken in-game chat filter, that is too restrictive and unconfigurable.  The good: Hackers are almost non-existant right now and the only hacker I come across from time to time is a 'fun' hacker. (if that make sense) Nostalgia if you are like me and played for 4~5 years.

"Hello, if you are going to buy this game again after migrating from Xbox, please take a few notes. If you happened to play World at War during the next annualized release, at which point they stopped updating/patching the game and went on with the next, you'd know that even on consoles this game was riddled with hackers of all kind. Wallhackers, aimbotters, rainbow names and such. The game has not changed on PC, and they are doing nothing to stop this, so unless you have absolutely no soul I would completely avoid Multiplayer. Keep in mind the game is not entirely pointless to buy. Most get it simply just for zombies, and while there is no mod support it seems Treyarch is fine with custom maps and zombies-type gamemodes, but the downside is that there will be absolutely no vanilla servers if not playing with friends. This is kind of where it gets excrutiating after purchasing the game, as playing Vanilla was the first thing I wanted to do. Der Reise servers seem to be your best bet if looking to play vanilla, as it's such a good map that those who mod Zombies servers seem to not mess with it. Playing with friends seems to be one of the only ways to truly have fun, so if you lack the friends, either visit discussions and add someone or make friends with people on Zombies servers. As said before, do not even try to play multiplayer in it's dead state. There are little to no actual, true players in it anymore and I doubt there ever will be again. Even servers with no hacks on seem to have Double XP on, which completely ruins the build-up and fun of multiplayer in the first place.  Campaign: 8/10.

Many negative numbers/10 Zombies: 9/10, godmodders and such are present, otherwise vanilla it is one of the best games ever made.",0,1

"(mulitplayer) Either you join a lobby full of hackers who lower your scores, and reset everything you've done, call in a nuke with 2 kills ect. Or you join a lobby full of campers, I'm talking hardcore sitting in the corner with an rpd silenced.... I even caught 2 people boosting once !!! and there's very few lobbies to join as nobody plays it anymore, you'll leave to find a new one, straight back in, I do not recommend you buy this if you're looking for some nostalgia, buy an xb360 and get it on there if you must, but not pc.",0,1

"Yes, I loved this game it's awesome! It never gets damn boring! If you're so much into leveling as I am, you're gonna have much time spend on this game! BUT! Here's the ♥♥♥♥ing thing! There's a important reason why I write this TODAY! I've bought this game like one or two months ago! I enoyed it a lot til this day. Because when I joined a match today I stumbled into a hacked lobby, which is actually nothing in usual in cod as you may know, you just gently exit it... But today, I ♥♥♥♥IN GOT BANNED FOR JUST NOTHIN! It is just ♥♥♥♥in rediculous! I did not do one little rule breaking thing, and got punished for the 'crime' of another person! I even tried contacting the the staff, as adviced by steam... And this is what came out:    1 Message by you on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 6:53 As I today started steam and thought about playing a bit Modern Warfare 2 Online, everything was fine. I logged into steam, started the game and finally went into an Team-Deathmatch game. Then i quickly realized, it was a hacked lobby. Since it was some kind of Snipers-Only match. I then turned around and went out again. Then the strange things started. Firstly my name was, for non me known reason, completely dark blue, as if I'd have set it up in my Steam name, those color combinations I mean, which I did not! I thought then 'it might maybe be just an bug...', so I just started to look for another match, another TDM one. But this time, when I'm entered, I immediately got kicked out and left with the message 'Cheat detected.'. I was just shocked! Because I did nothing wrong! I was not hacking at all! I just accidently joined such a lobby! I even asked, before leaving, who was hacking in there. A player with the name 'Progster', or something like that, responded. So I tried another time to play a match and the exact same thing happened. Until that point my name was still blue. I decided to restart the game and see, if it may goes back to the nnormal state. And so it was. My name then turned white (or orange in the menus I mean), but the ban still existed!  So my question is, if you may could reset the ban and instead punish the right perpetrator. I did really nothing wrong and I was so happy when I finally got the game. I just can't believe that I got really banned... All this happened like half an hour ago. So I beg again for resetting this somehow happened ban. This has already happened to me in the past, but I did not got banned for accidently joining an hacked lobby...  Thank you very much. - Message by our staff on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 6:53 If you have been VAC Banned, the ban will not be removed.  For more information, please refer to our FAQs:  https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4044-QDHJ-5691  2 Message by you on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 6:54 But it was really not my fault! I wasn't hacking at all! Is there no possible way of checking this? 3 Message by you on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 7:05 So this is what I've read in your FAQ: Q: I am a legit player but I am afraid of getting banned?  A: It is extremely unlikely that VAC will make a mistake when banning someone. Even if this occurs you can simply contact Steam Support who will usually lift the ban if it was given wrongly. Again, this is extremely rare.   So please...    Now you see, they wont even keep their word. I don't even think they read what I wrote there! I bet it's just somekind of an auto message! Since it was posted immediately after i posted mine. How rude of them! Im gonna be patient until tomorrow... But still, for everyone who is about to spend money on this, to this day its a pretty high price for the game, keep in my this could happen to you, too!!! ive read through some threads as well. I dont think there is hope for my siuation, since those people never responded with something positive again...",1,0
"I love Postal 2! And I loved the humor and story of Postal 3. The only thing why I dont recommend this is the lackluster gameplay and the several technical Issues.  Pros:  + its Postal through and through, Sex , Violence, Racism, Animal Abuse and tons of other stuff that made this franchise famous + the story is pretty funny + many new and old weapons to choose from + a new city to explore + some celebrity characters + great sense of humor and satire + multiple paths to choose from, that actually change things up   Cons:  - on a technical side the game is a complete mess. So many bugs,glitches and crashes, I will point out the worst one by one - a bug caused one of my save games to crash on being loaded.....that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off so much since I was far into the game - ALL the mlee weapons are absolutley useless.....you cant hit anything because they are so extremley poorly programmed - hit detection is a absurd - 3rd person view is pointless and even worse can trigger bugs and camera glitches.......why not stick with first person? This is a major downer! - ranged weapons feel way off when aiming, you can hit your targets but it just feels so bad to aim - gasoline is buggy and doesnt work like in postal 2, you cant pour it onto people anymore, they have to walk on the ground you´re pouring at (like I said, many special weapons are buggy) - way too many missions stick to the same formular - horde shooter where you have to take out certain people - many random crashes - you cant mount a cat on a gun -_- seriously whos decision was it to remove this feature? Its like one of the most iconic things in Postal 2! - the explorable city is pretty small, there isnt much to actually do, I expected some kind of funny mini games, there are funny arcade cabins, but they are only cosmetic.....how disappointing - the enemy AI is none-existent.......they are so incredibly incompetent at doing anything - and like I said....many many bugs in missions and scripted events  Oh Postal.....I loved the second one, and the humor and one liners are back....but with such a horrible gameplay mechanics thats its barely playable. I played through the good campaign and it crashed too much on the bad campaign and I deinstalled in rage. If this gets waaaaay lower in price I can recommend this to a hardcore fan, other than that keep away from this.",0,1

I don't know what the big fuss is about; I do not like this game. I realized very quickly that this game is just a rehash of that old open-world Spiderman game. They just replaced Spiderman with Alex. Not to mention that I feel extremely overpowered and I am not that good at video games for the most part (50+ hours spend only on the first level of Demon Souls before I switched to PC). There's also the fact that the cut scene audio clips and cuts out constantly even when I turn down the settings.

"This game was piece of art when it first came out, so many improvements from Call of Duty 4. The campaign for Modern Warfare 2 was an absolute masterpiece, you continue on from Call of Duty 4, playing as different branches, with different characters, though this game does have it's moments being a bit repetative later on in the game but something new always pops up to give you a boost of interest, the graphics for this game are amazing, huge step up from COD4, the AI is improved but still has it's moments where it is completely unintelligent and has no regard for itself, animations are great, many weapons throughout the campaign to choose from, the singplayer earns a 9/10. As for the multiplayer I cannot say the same, let me start off saying that Modern Warfare 2 is only worth playing for it's singeplayer due to the fact that the multiplayer is full of hackers all day everyday, and you can risk being deranked in a specific server, that goes with saying you can be at risk for a VAC ban for claims of cheating, the multiplayer is nice and all, lot's of intense fighting, however the hackers are the main reason why multiplayer is ruined for this, so I do not recommend this game for it's multiplayer.",0,1

I had a bit of fun with Postal 2 back in the day so when Portal 3 promised me a honey badger as a weapon and a better camera for the game I threw my money at this once it was on sale. As I purchased and installed this game I found the free roaming atmosphere that left the world open in the previous game where choice was key to story progression had been replaced with a small linear map that pushed obnoxious cutscenes in our face with a voiceover that screams 'I'm trying to sound like Duke Nukem.' The worst part is that this game actually gave me herpes. As I played this game I found that my fingers started breaking out in blemishes which then spread to my arms. Before anything could spread further the honey badger jumped out of the screen and ripped out my jugular. With my last breath I write this review. Please tell my family I'm sorry I bought this game.,0,1

"This game is not bad. It does not anger me, disappoint me, or rub me the wrong way. It's just kinda there. The game plays like a cross between poker and solitaire. You see your stacks of cards (top card only per stack, like in solitaire), and you see the same for your opponent. You move cards around like in solitaire, stacking them on other cards, except you're trying to make combinations of five cards, which can be poker combos like flushes, straights, etc. You then use those to attack your enemy, and vice versa. You have bonus card thingies on the side of your screen that you can use to attack when you build up enough rage.  It's an okay premise, but it doesn't really seem to change and the story is just okay. It's one of the least compelling games I've played. I have nothing against this game, which is really saying something. I typically love or hate a game, but this one is just kinda meh. I wouldn't recomment paying more than a Steam sale price, by any means, but I'd recommend you play the demo if you're interested. The gameplay you experience in 20-30 minutes of that is pretty much the entirety of the gameplay from what I've seen thus far. It's not very exciting or interesting, and nothing draws me in to make me want to keep playing. It's an okay game, but that's it.",0,1

There is no point of playing after your stats where hacked therefore you won't grind to unlock prestige. Only way I found to fix my stats to start from 0 and save my progress as I played incase I ran into a hacked lobby was using a program that would would reset stats and save my progress. After 400 hours steam decided this program I was running was a hack and I got VAC banned and lost my game and my profile is marked as a hacker. I wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemy.,0,1

The only bad thing is that the servers, because I played a couple game then got perma ban for no reason. Decided to play on another server.....an hour later perma ban again for no reason. So in the end I got perma ban from all the good populated good ping servers. If you are looking to play singleplayer or zombies with friends then yeah go for it, if not don't bother wasting the money.",1,0
"Bought this game a bit too late... wish I would've been around to play it back in it's prime.  This game is simply a classic. My first Counter-Strike was Source. I loved Source a lot, and that lead to me getting CS:GO. CS:GO is now my most played game. ANYWAYS, I bought this game pretty recently and I love playing it. Too bad the servers are bugged I think, otherwise, still has an alright community. great gameplay and requires a lot of skill.  I love the wallbanging and the style you have to shoot. Not so much run n gun like the other games in the series.  I definitely recommend this game. Even though I doubt many people are still buying this game!",1,0

Anything over 150 is 110% unplayable, so if you live in the U.S. midwest and only want a WW2 multiplayer shooter, you're actually better off buying CoD 2.",0,1

"I first played Counter-Strike back in 1999, when it was still just a mod. I went to it on a daily basis, for several hours, as my main source of entertainment and gathering of friends until about 2002, when other activities came along. I only went back to it now, in 2012. This unveiled the greatest disappointment and proof of destruction of a game I have ever experienced. As it is today, this is not Counter-Strike. It is a broken, unrecognizable, nearly useless form of the original game. Valve has let this game rot to death and still make an easy profit for nothing. The server browser is a joke. It is simply broken. The results it returns are completely inaccurate and all servers you will find are run by non-Steam users, with the game settings altered to who knows what, and 90% of them playing the Dust map. The other servers are running non-official maps and pointless game modes. In addition, you can not set your client to disallow the automatic download of custom server sounds or other trash that is force-fed through your connection to alter the game. Counter-Strike has been so blatantly abandoned, that it is shocking Valve still charges something for it. You will also see advertisements while you are connecting to the servers, and while you wait for the next round once you have been killed. Counter-Strike is the epitome of falling from grace and becoming an outright failure. It has become an embarrassment and a gaming tragedy.  Counter-Strike is bad.",0,1
"This game is without a doubt an arcady first person shooter, just like Call of Duty is know to be. Simple mechanics, decent graphics, and semi accurate story (im not sure the characters in-game actually exsisted), and hey! The first Zombie mode (all WaW DLC maps included). Unfortunatly the ports to the pc arent always good and ive had multiple problems with this game since i bought it (2 years ago). for starters there are a few wierd problems with intel socket GPUs, i would not use it with them since there is a wierd slow down/ speed up when fps goes up and down like a yoyo (This might be different with the newer ones, since i used an intel HD 3000 with 6gb of 1333 sys ram. partly because the iris pro operates with a small amount of ESram, i suppose a ram upgrade would suffice.) But it seems to work with an FX 4100 with 8gb sys ram and a 2gb GTX 660 SC (super clocked).  Now last time i checked the multiplayer was almost empty, since the nature of call of duty is everybody moves to the next game and starts again. and MW2 was incredibly popular. So its hard to find a game online. Not to mention the majority are modded and i expect there are plenty of hackers waiting to prey on your patience, althought it would be completely usless for them.  Since this is the game that brought in the idea of zombie survival, there isnt much too it, compared to BO1/2. Border up windows get money kill zombies that get in, get money, buy new guns, kill more zombies. yadayadayda. Its the mode at its infancy and dont expect the full blown mode it is today.  In hindsight i would not have bought it. But hey! this is to help you guys/girls to decide. But it is my opinion, everyone is different. although the multiplayer being almost empty is a fact.   thanks and have fun!",1,0

"Horrible, just horrible. Everyone gives this good reviews based on nostalgia. I saw all the good reviews and thought I should try it out. Upon opening the game, was a cringy menu. I fiddle with the settings, and theres no damn graphics options! I put the crosshair on small.(Definitely not small) So, I go to servers and all the servers have horrible maps. Plus, closest servers had 0 players. I click on a Dust 2 server with 10 players. When it loads up, nobody speaks ♥♥♥♥ing english. The buy menu controls were so ♥♥♥♥ed up I couldnt buy a gun. So, I stuck with the pistol. I go through the middle, and all the players look the same! You cant even tell who's who. Literally, the ♥♥♥♥ing same. So I die instantly because i couldn't even tell it was an enemy. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I finally managed to buy a gun in the ♥♥♥♥ed up menu. I find someone, spray at em', and surprisingly it was enemy. My gun starts shooting in the ♥♥♥♥ing sky, recoil over 9000, and I was burst firing! Absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Another HORRIBLE thing about this game, its graphics and audio! It just doesnt meet todays standards. I think I might have to bleach my eyes after glancing at this game. Its horrible. I only played the game for under 10 minutes and I already want to kill my self. Trust me, save your money. If you loved this game as a kid, I dont care get it. But if youre looking for a good FPS, to TODAYS standards, dont get this garbarge! Save your ten dollars and use it to get your ♥♥♥♥ sucked by the girl down the street. So, simplest way possible.

"Essentially a single-player RPG with the contents of a MMO-rpg (expect the social aspect)  Some of the games artwork can at times be appealing, but personally I prefer a somewhat more toned down and realistic style. In this game, the characters have overly sized hands and weapons etc all showered with all the brightest colours the designers could think of.  The game consist of a few faction quest lines, which at times can be interesting, but all too often quest are 'go to certain point, fetch/kill, and return). Real choicemaking is non-existent.  The main story line is bland and generic, even with the '10 000 years' of background history the develpoers brag about. Magic elves, technical dwarfes, in-between humans... . The lack of good voiceacting only contributes to the game's inability to immerse, with probably as few as 10 voice-actors trying to the best of their ability to voice all characters in the game.  The combat-system is quite nice. Quite easy, but a lot of ways for the player to adapt underway to the way they want to play. And unlike more classic RPGs all character developments can be changed for a small fee, so that the player don't have to think ahead. Nice, for some... . Almost all ingame quest-rewards and looting is scaled it seems, so the player seldom experience any sense of joy or positive surprise when overcoming obstacles. Many enemies are scaled too it seems.  Personally I had to stop playing this game after encountering a game-breaking bug (Her righteous fury-quest), of which there is no official fix to 4 years after release (due to the developers bankruptcy, I guess). Therefore I could not fully explore the main idea of this game - fate. I find the idea of fate troubling on a logical level, and the game as far as I played it, did only contribute to this with all its logical fallacies.  Nice enough game if you are looking for mind-numbing, button-mashing action-rpg, with little need for investment on the player's part. Stay clear (even on sale), if you are looking for immersion, challenge and a sense of accomplishment.   This game will suck the marrow out of your bones if you are a true RPG fan. 5/10",0,1

"The combat is okay, but magic is straight up better than the rest of the trees (which are broken up by your standard warrior/thief/wizard) and while there is a 'lot of content' most of the side missions are repetative and boring. The people who give those quests are almost real people, but I feel like while there was all this time put into the world could have gone into more of the gameplay itself.  I can not recomend this for the current $20 price tag, and I wouldn't recomend it at a lower price tag. I would say there are probably better options out there, especially if you don't want to use a controller or are not a fan of bad camera.",0,1
"Quake was the first game I was ever really addicted to and focused a big portion of my time on for months or years at a time. Counter-Strike was the second - and easily more addicting. There's a reason that I still compare every multi-player shooter experience back to original Counter-Strike, to this day. There's a reason I still compare every server community to this (Counter-Strike servers each had their own community and personality and people truly got to know each other back in the day, compared to these days, where a server is just something you're automatically dumped into and feels like every other server).  Despite many iterations, nothing quite plays like the original. It's not hard to see why there are still 10,000 to 60,000 people playing this  at any one time on any day , fifteen years after launch and why it is always in the top ten games currently being played on all of Steam.  This is where it all started. Without this, there's an entire genre of shooter and multi-player that just vanishes. The original days of Counter-Strike remain the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my entire life. It's unlikely that will ever be trumped.",1,0

"I had initially planned to reserve this feature only for providing positive input on games that I truly felt deserved some attention that they might not generally get, but I've given this some thought and think people really need to be warned about how bad this game really is because the pictures can be deceiving.  The art is nice. I will give it that. However the atmosphere is ruined at literally the FIRST moment one of the two initial characters you see speaks, as their voice acting is some of the worst I have ever heard. These people's voices would not be out of place in a film like The Room. There is also absolutely no introductory exposition. The main character (whoever he is, I think he's a cop, could be wrong) immediately starts angrily grilling people on things with nothing to explain his motivation or why the player should care. Add on the terrible voice acting and things get very painful, very fast.  As well as no explanation of the story, there is also no explanation of the controls. I figured out the basics of moving and picking things up as that's as generic as can be, but upon reaching my first real puzzle I was completely at a loss as to how I should be manipulating the items in my inventory or making use of them in the environment. I poked and prodded, clicked and reclicked and what should've been a very, very simple task of just poking the end of a key to make it fall out of the lock on the other side of the door turned into an impossible task when nothing I did registered. This is where I gave up on the game in disgust.  I purchsed this game for $2.50. I do not feel it was worth that amount. You have all now been warned.",0,1

"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2010 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2012. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.

Im sorry to say that this whole franchise died after CoD4:ModernWarfare. That edition was as classic as CounterStrike.  Yet they wanted to milk their gamers further.. and further.. and further and here we are 2013 around 6 games later..   No soul left in these games anymore.,0,1
"This game is a Pay to Win Simulater, I had a friend who paid $100 to this game just to win because he is bad at this game. Now, he has the best weapons because he paid $100. He wasted his money and you shouldn't waste your money either because this game is pay2win and if you like to pay 2 win, than don't play it anyways because this game is overall bad and nobody should ever go and try or feel or anything else to this game because it deserves nothing. This game should die because it is so heavily pay2win, they have red tickets which require you to spend so much AP which is the in-game currency which you gamble for red tickets to get just some cool overpowered weapons in the shop. You can also buy exculsive weapons with only AP and theres sometimes a special shop called the mega capsule shop where you can spend $20 for a virtual weapon and own everybody with your OP gun.

"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 in itself is not really a bad shooter. It can be quite fun at times, but it's shortcomings are plenty and I would advise you purchase CoD 4: Modern Warfare instead.  The biggest problem this game has is the way servers are found. It has a 'matchmaking' system that forces you to join servers you know nothing about, which are then hosted by a random player in the game. See the problem? Due to this, prepare for wonderful amounts of lag in every game, and in case a player forced to host the server leaves, you have to wait for 30-60 seconds for the server to migrate host to another random player(in the middle of the match). Add to this the fact that you can't pick which settings on a server you prefer, be ready for things like people jumping 50m up and server playing slow-mo or being forced to spin 360 degrees for every bullet you fire.  Another problem are the hackers. Playing this game with a wallhack seems to be a must for most players, as every enemy knows where you are at any moment and will shoot you through walls without you moving an inch, throw grenades at your face or kill you before they even come around the corner(that one might just be the wonderful lag I'm talking about).  Also, the game has a big issue with large monitors. Despite having resolution set to that of my monitor, when aiming down the sight the mouse will move for 5-10 pixels for each 1 pixel it moves when I move my mouse on my desktop, making precision aiming impossible and forcing close quarter combat. Maps themselves also force this, as most of them are made to suit close combat, and you can forget about any sort of tactics, as they are made in a way where you're forced to go down a 'corridor'(whether it's a street, tunnel, building) and the enemy can come only from in front of you, or behind you.  Game modes offered are plenty, but dead. As the game works on forced matchmaking system, you can choose between TDM, DM, Hardcore TDM and S&amp;D. TDM, however, usually contains 80% of the player base, which is around 500 players online normal times.  The game falls short of it predecessor in almost every aspect. Avoid my mistake, as now I'm angry I wasted 12.49€ on this instead of buying CoD4: MW as I originally planned.",0,1

" I love Counter Strike, I should end it here. But I'll be honest and say I grew up with Source, wasn't old enough to experince 1.6 sadly. But giving it a try, it's very different, having to buy ammo, see what the original maps looked like before being changed in Source.

"Kingdoms of Amalur is at odds with itself. On the one hand, it strives to be an epic fantasy along the lines of Skyrim or Oblivion (or even WoW). On the other, it is an arcade action game. The arcade part is fun. The rest... not so much. The backstory and the lore are dull, as are most of the voice actors. Quests are generally interesting... many are simple fetch quests or kill monster X at location Y. But many are multi-part with intriguing backstory.  The story has something to do with your character be exempt from fate because you were resurrected from the dead. And other characters want to help or exploit you. Or something like that. But, as a whole, it just doesn't come together. There's nothing compelling about the story. The mini-games pale in comparison to their Bethesda counterparts. I clicked through every dialog tree as quickly as possible. There are stones scattered in the world which, when touched, divulge some of the lore via a voice-over. I couldn't pay attention to a single one of them.   Now, on the combat side, it resembles more of a Darksiders flair. You roll around to avoid enemy attacks and wait for the right moment to close and shred your opponent. Some monsters just absorb hits until they die. Others will take a few before striking back. The only downside is that it becomes repetitive. Each dungeon has the same types of monsters, reasonbly spread across the map. But after my 5th encounter with kobolds, for instance, I was ready to move on.  Kingdoms of Amalur sports an RPG element. Your character levels up and points can be allocated into different skill trees. Some of them unlock cool moves that can be used in combat. Others unlock world exploration skills like alchemy (dull), lockpicking (dull), finding hidden stashes (dull), and the like. And, you can re-roll your character at any time -- a feature that I haven't used yet, but appreciate that it is there.  The game is definitely on the easy side, especially if you avail yourself of the powerful weapons available at the start of the game. Set the game on hard and pick less damaging weapons (like daggers) to make the game more exciting.   Nevertheless, with six hours into the game, I'm probably done with it. It hasn't grabbed me. And, as a gamer with limited time for gaming, I have to be engaged from the first moment. The story needs to be compelling. The characters (especially my character) need to be intriguing; their dialog something I listen to with rapt interest. And if not that, then the action needs to be exciting. Perhaps if it mixed the combat with some Prince of Persia like platforming elements, and downplayed the story/RPG stuff?  It feels too much like a couple of different incomplete games all squished together into a mostly ineffective whole. It's not enough to keep my interest.",0,1

"Well, here it is. Some call it 'the mother of shooters', some call it 'bullsh*t'. Well, I can´t tell, whether you will like it, but the fact is, that it started one of the first big shooter franchises ever.   Pros:  -awesome gameplay -awesome gunplay -nostalgia -teambased -mechanics   Cons:  -a bit outdated though   I myself like the classic Counter Strike, but I think there should be big Skillbased MatchMaking Sites like FaceIt or ESEA (if possible even free ones), because the Competetive Mode from Global Offensive is pretty good (even though sometimes it sucks with its rank system).  I think, that it is a great game, but perhaps some players will be put off by the old graphics, but these are pretty good, if you imagine, that this game is about 16 years old.

"Have you ever played an MMORPG and felt, 'oh gosh, I wish there was no once else but me and the NPC's around here'? Then this game is right up your alley. This game is right down to the core an offline MMORPG. You get tons of trash armor, there's something that reminds of dungeons, kill and fetch quests everywhere and as much action in the gameplay as you would expect of an MMORPG. While the overworld have some pretty places to look at, you rarely get much of a chance to do so since you spend most of your time inside somewhere.  Positive: + Combat is responsive when dodging and there's nice hit detection when hitting an enemy + The armor is the game looks good + Overworld is pretty and there's a lot to look at + If you dig deep there's can be some fun character builds  Negative: - Using shields in combat is absolutely unresponive and awful - The amount of trash equipment you get makes it a chore to find anything. You spend more time going through trash than you do comparing which weapon to use - Questing is VERY overwhelming in this game. You get quest, on quest, on quest, on quest. - Questing is completely uninspired. If you've ever played an MMORPG you probably have experience with the kinds of quest you get in this game. - They don't put much effort into getting you interested in the story, which is needed in this game since you get so many story side-quests. Sometimes you end up doing a quest and out nowhere find out it was apparently a huge part to the main story, but unless you're really reading and listening to every single NPC on the way you won't get anything from it. - I played over 10 hours and not a single hint of a mount of any kind. Wouldn't even be a little surprised if at least 5 hours of my gameplay time has been just running from dungeon to dungeon and city to city just to get filled with quests. Some cities only exists to give you quests. - Overworld, while pretty, feels very empty. You get the feeling of playing a dead MMORPG everywhere and it just stops the world from feeling alive at all.  With all of this said, you might find some enjoyment if you really enjoy making original character builds and mess around with that. But if you're anything like me and just enjoy some classic warrior action this game is going to bore you to tears and you're better off with Guild Wars 2, which actually is an MMORPG with an alive world and have fluid combat as well.  Only buy this game if you're starving for some wRPG action.",1,0

"Ahh Modern Warfare 2, one of my favorite games of all time. but unfortunately it have become a hack fest.  I guess i can talk about the positives about this game before i tell you why i'm giving this a negative review. The things i love about this game, where do i even start. The first thing i can say that i love about this game are the killstreaks. The killstreaks like the nuke changed the whole game and it was so much fun getting the nuke. The other positives are: the guns (AKA intervention), Maps, Perks, campaign, spec ops and everything else. Now let's get into why i'm giving this a negative review.   (This review is only for the PC version, the Console version are still fine and you can get into a hack/modd free lobby easily)   if you are planning on buying this game right now, wait for a Sale. almost every game you join is filled with hackers using god mode and other cheats to ruin the experience for other people trying to have a fun, casual time. But sometimes you might join a lobby where there is no hackers or modders and when you find those type of lobbies the game become so much fun. but you realise that there is a small chance of returning to a good lobby again.  So that's the reason i'm giving this game (ON STEAM) a negative review. the game is almost unplayable with the amounts of hackers and modders ruining the game. So if you are planning on picking this game up on PC you should probably wait untill a sale happens. Or just get the game of Consoles becuse atleast there it's actually playable.  It's wierd giving this game a negative review since i love it so much. But since Infinity ward and activision won't do ♥♥♥♥ to stop the hackers or modders from ruining this game, i'm afriad this game is gonna be full of hackers and modders till the game eventually dies.",0,1

"I haven't even gotten into the game yet.   But there is this incredibly stupid glitch. That the dev's haven't even bothered to attempt to fix. The games resolution will be stuck at a max of 1280x800. In order to get around this, you have to do a ton of messing around with files (potentially downloading a .dll file to replace theirs, so that you can get a full 1080p resolution.) There are some simpler solutions, that have worked for some people. (Lucky them.) They haven't worked for me yet. I haven't even succesfully gotten the game to work yet. I shouldn't have to spend this amount of time to get it to work though. Especially when I paid for the game.   This will stay a 'NOT RECCOMENDED' review, until someone fixes this bug. Which I HIGHLY DOUBT will happen, since this game is flat out too old to be worth their time to fix it. It's a bummer this bug is here. Because it is preventing people from enjoying this game.  EDIT: I fixed the resolution issue... but the .dll modification I had to make, doesn't allow for any AA. Which is total bullcrap in my opinion. 1920x1080 is an incredibly common resolution.

"I'm going to try to write a review that's a little bit more descriptive than the other ones.   AVA is fairly very old game. On high graphics, it looks amazing, albeit, not as good as today's fps games' graphics. The gameplay is fast paced and it feels really good. It was one of the best f2p mmofps's out there. It was even better than some paid fps games. There's a reason as to why I say, 'was one of the best.' That's because everything about this game went to the dumps when ijji handed it over to Aeria Games. Sure, gameplay is relatively the same, but it's just not worth playing anymore. Aeria Games decided to remove one of the best features, permanent guns. If you're bounced around between f2p mmofps games, then you know that permanent guns is a very attractive feature. Permanent guns was one of the reasons that I settled with this game. Next, they decided to make the game pay to win. The only permanent guns that you have are the starter weapons. You need to maintain and repair them by paying with the game's currency. But an update greatly increased the repair prices. In order to maintain your all your guns and still make a profit, you need to play for around 6 hours each day. And those 6 hours aren't even going to pay for the guns that you want to buy. Those are expensive, and they disapear after a month! They made these changes to give players more incentive to play, but in reality, this game has become a chore.  I can no longer recommend this game to anyone because it's not good anymore.",0,1

Head-shot boxes have NEVER been the same and since VAC I miss seeing the cheaters getting caught Red-Handed and added to the International blacklist. I still keep a black book of every IP at the scene of any crimes. If you want to experience the original AWP trying playing OP4. Shoot opponent in the hand or foot and they are toast! If you are still mad that 'they' Cliff and whoever took the silencer off the Colt I got the SOB back. Visit  ANTPLA.NET  to get skin pack II. Original was from ~01 and is still downloadable as General Sphinx Brothers of Steel BOS skin pack. I was there playing UK's Ganstawars Last Man Standing Gameplay type messing with the bots skins trying to get CS skins on Gangstawar bots and enjoyed how one of them was invisible. Sort of like a prank. If you can tommygun invisible opponent you are like a Luke Skywalker bad a$$. Skin pack II has the 'Starwars' lightsaber replacement for knife and the AK to plasma rifle from 1980's movie 'Alien'. The skins out compete CSGO any day of the week with 400fps instead of stuck on 30 same kernel. I got a duo-core up to 1200fps. Well I should not have shared the knowlege with other gamers on the map because next thing you know everybody was doing it on their own character. [AU] DeathWish settled it when it got to CS with rainbow coloured animated reskins instead of them being invisible. My first game was CS Canyon_Siege and I was wondering why we all were moving around as ghost spectators. I am not the Prodigy Inc SPHINX. I have only made auto-admin called 3 forms of punishment. It was for Admin Mod then re-written for AMX. Lost. No need for it anymore anyway. People still found a way to hack with it and fly around the maps prior to hook and vote for matrix, etc. Give them enough rope and instead of being slapped, killed, kicked, ban was in effect for short period. Essentially you mixed 2 words with lag and server and other various buZz words like gay server all these got punishments set fourth. Talking crap about admin was a slaying. Lag was a slap. It was based off Trinity and the server was the spirit. If trash talk is about the 'spirit', that is not forgivable or rather as tolerated and the ban was automatically set. That resolved major breach of security. Suddenly there is no need to have tons of admins. Most of whom were there just to exploit code often unintentionally, due to buggy 3rd party plug-ins such as STATSME.",1,0

"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.  The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:  Bomb defusal: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage rescue: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP escort: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion. A player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although Counter-Strike: Condition Zero added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as 'freeze time') to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral 'buy zones' that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.  Standard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage, planting the bomb (Terrorist) or defusing the bomb (Counter-Terrorist).  The scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and ping (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.  Killed players become 'spectators' for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names before their next spawn, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players, and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them. Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of Internet cafes and Voice over IP programs such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo). This form of cheating is known as 'ghosting.'",1,0

"What a disappointment. I wanted to like this game, I really did. I read that it was a decent RPG with good game mechanics and pretty graphics. However, in my experience, the most the game could muster from me is one giant 'meh.'  To start, the good points: Combat in Kingdoms of Amalur is by far it's best feature. Combat is fast, acrobatic, and exciting. Taking down mobs of enemies with a variety of weapons while dodging and firing off magic spells is an absolute highlight of this game. Controls are responsive and intuitive. Boss fights can be thrilling.   The voice acting in the game is definitely above average, if not very good. The main story quest (from what I got through) seems interesting. And the game definitely looks pretty, albeit more on the cartoony side than the likes of The Witcher or Skyrim (although that's not necessarily a bad thing.) Overall, what I read initially is not untrue; this is a decent RPG, good game mechanics, and looks pretty good.  Unfortunately, that's where the positives end and the disappointments begin.  Most glaring is, lest you be fooled, Kingdoms of Amalur IS NOT AN OPEN WORLD ENVIRONMENT. It is a series of corridors arranged in such a way as to give the illusion of one. Resource placement within this corridored environment is lazy, with resource generating plants conveniently located periodically along the periphery of said corridors. The side quests are similarly lazy and primarily consist of fetch quests (go and kill these guys, bring me back my ring. Collect a bunch of ingredients for potions to save the town, bring them back to me.)  Also, if KoA came any closer to straight ripping off elements of Skyrim and the Elder Scrolls series of games, I think we would have had a lawsuit on our hands. Equivalents of the Fighter's Guild, Mage's Guild, and Theives Guild? Check, check, and check, Strikingly similar lockpicking mechanism/mini-game? Oh, you betcha. Alchemy, Blacksmithing, and Enchanting requiring specific workstations of each? Bingo. Hidden traps represented BY BEAR TRAPS, actuated spike tiles, and trip wires which set off various nasties. Yup. (I mean, the bear traps might have been the last straw for me).  KoA also suffers from trying to cram way too much weapon and item variety into the game than is necessary. The result is the player being positively overwhelmed by the sheer volume of useless crap you pick up during play. Luckily, it provides a convenient and free fast travel mechanism to travel back to nearest towns to unload your useless junk. Oh, and that reminds me, all the towns I visited were essentially carbon copies of each other, with the various crafting stations, a pub, and a couple of random houses in each.  While KoA definitely has it's high points -- with combat being at the absolute top -- it relies too heavily on overused RPG tropes coupled with a very heavy 'borrowing' of mechanics and game elements from other titles. It suffers from the developers trying to cram WAY too much content, instead of focusing on providing a smaller, truer open world environment, innovative mechanics and quests, and overall immersive experience. In the end, as pretty as the game can look at times, what the game is lacking is originality. The leads to most quests and the search for crafting materials to feel more like chores, than fun. At only 8 hours into the game, I found myself overwhelmingly bored. And it's a shame.  (IF YOU DID NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)",0,1

"This game probably plays very nicely; however, there is literally no support for the game for modern computers. I am trying to run it on a high-end gaming PC (nVidia 970M, 16GB RAM, plenty of hdd and ssd space, lots of processing power, no other nonessential processes running in the background) and I can barely run this game at medium settings, which are only one step above 'low'. I tried messing with all combinations of video settings, and the game still failed. When I tried googling for documentation to troubleshoot this problem, all I found were a few words about Disciples 2 that stated that one must enable Direct3D in the graphics settings. Sadly, there is no such setting in Disciples 3.  As such, the game is essentially unplayable to anyone with a fairly new computer. I'd strongly advise against purchasing the game.",0,1

"Okay so where to begin? Take a generalized fantasy idea, release it as an offline MMORPG and well, here we are.   Kingdom's of Amalur... Reckoning?   Usually we save these type of lowbrow subtitles for terrible sequels but I guess they just wanted to cut out the middle man and admit this game is straight up garbage right from the get go... that being said, here's the general idea:  It's the cliche, you're the chosen one except you just don't know it yet. You need to prove yourself to a bunch of lowlife commoners by fetching buckets of well water and killing rats in multiple cellars or 'dungeons'. Don't forget to pick flowers and melt down magic stones at alchemy desks as an annoying side meta game to the already implemented side quest meta game.  Again it's one of those games where being a thief / rogue / stealth character is incredibly beneficial. It's getting to the point where single player RPG's developed today should just lock you in as a thief and you can choose to allocate stat points differently if you don't like looting treasure in a treasure looting game.  If you decide to purchase it then prepare yourself for monotonous fetch quests, non-existant plot lines, you can skip over so you can fetch the next peice of candy, and average game play with long walks across open fields of nothingness.... occasionally fighting some disgrunteld vagabond's and wolves looking for their next meal ticket.  You will certainly be in for the 'reckoning' of a life time if you purchase it at full price...",0,1

"I booted up the game and watched the 'intro' that you get after idling for a brief bit at the start-up screen, and to my dismay, the sound was completely insanely broken. 'Maybe it's better in the game', I guessed to myself, and proceeded to fiddle with the options, as one ALWAYS does after buying a new game.  But lo and behold, I then noticed that the highest resolution option available is a measly 1280x800. I wasn't aware of the fact that this game was made in göddämn 2002. 'Fine', I thought, and went with it. I fixed the controls (the ones necessary, anyway, since I'm using a 360 controller for it), and exited the options.  I tried starting a new game (oops, spoiled it there, didn't I?) with the key word in that sentence being TRIED. Yeah. I can't even start the game proper without it crashing. Three failed tries and a cursory google search later, I've come to the conclusion that this is not a game that was designed for even REMOTELY modern computers.  TL;DR: THIS GAME IS NON-FUNCTIONING. AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS. 0/10",0,1
FIRE IN THE HOLE,1,0
"It’s not fair to say that the darkness consumed me, for it was I who enveloped myself in it, there was no coercion involved, only my own maddened curiosity. Another Postal game was released? Well, the second one was charming in that somewhat difficult to explain way that not very good games sometimes are, and it was on sale for a tenner, what could I possibly lose? Sometimes in the quiet hours of the night, when it seems not even God is there to hear me, I ask myself what I could have saved had I never clicked ‘Add to Cart’. It’s more than the ten dollars, what I lost that day transcends the mere balancing of a checkbook, when I played this game the concepts of love, of faith in my fellow man, the very knowledge of any pleasures I had once known all fled from me in an instant.   I wish I could chalk my dislike of this game up to the awful controls, the movement clunkier than a 50’s movie robot or the aiming that I can only describe as ‘acrid’, like the breath of a drunken pirate manning the cannons of his schooner, the fearsome ‘Nobody Will Ever Love You’. I can’t though, much like an iceberg made of solid human feces it goes much deeper than the surface problems. I didn’t even come across anything that offensive in my two-hour waterboarding session with Postal 3, I know that’s exactly what it’s meant to do, and it succeeds with a lot of people, but it just fell flat. The limp and lifeless writing, which is exactly what it permanently rendered certain parts of my body, is the most grotesque thing here aside from the animations and cutscenes. All of this combines to form some sort of chimera of awful design that leaves an unpleasant taste in your mouth that has nothing to do with the attempted gross out humor involving vacuum cleaners and AIDS infected cats.   In the end, it all just tries so hard to elicit some kind of response, positive or negative, from the player, but much like God on the day this game was released, it simply left me feeling apathetic.",1,0
"Prototype Pros and Cons ------------------------- Pros- stealth and some creative ideas like patsy and consuming people to gain upgrades and fun to run up walls  Cons-Frame rate dips constantly to single digits from 20-30, story is confusing and badly told; to many powers moves give wired button layout. Collectable will not show up till you get close and no way to track them, city layout is boring and really poor dialogue; Alex in cut scene sounds like an everyman that got a short deal, but then goes and kills hundreds of people, gameplay-combat gets frustrating and traversal gets boring, auto lock-on is not helpful ",0,1
"It pains me to not be able to recommend this collection because the games themselves are fantastic. However, they simply do not work 'out of the box.' The launcher presents the player with a menu that allows him to select which game to play. Zero out of six of them will work. Zero. Having said that, I was able to figure out what was wrong and get the games to work on my own, bypassing the launcher, within five minutes. That is only because I have extensive experience with DOS. Most people have little to no experience with that antiquated beast and simply will not be able to figure out how to get the games working on their own, nor should they have to.   It is simply unacceptable for games that do not work to be sold as if they do work. It is quite literally five minutes worth of work for Activision or Valve to get these games working. It is not the responsibility of the buyer to fix the lazily misconfigured junk that is being sold here. If people pay money for a working game, that's exactly what they should receive.",0,1

Unless something changed in the past two years RWS is not even making money off this because of the shady coding house they did business with to produce this. that company gutted the script, gutted the features and hurried the alpha out the door as a final game and screwed Running With Sissors out of the rights to the code.   this is an official game but one that RWS can't support and likely a game that they are not making a dime off of. wait for the next chapter of the game because I'm sure the postal dude will dismiss this one as the nightmare it is. Like mario's dream that was Super Mario Bros 2, Postal III might as well not exist in the catalog of this franchise.

"Holy ♥♥♥♥ this is bad.  I mean I heard it was bad. And the last two games were bad games in their own ways as well. [NOTE: I am not talking about offensive content I am really talking about the quality of the games]. Postal 1 was an absolute mess, and a violent, attention whoring relic of early PC gaming, and Postal 2 was a short, glitchy, grotesque, and insanly racist piece of FPS history...  But this is more glitchy than it's predecessor, it lacks the 'charm' the previous game had, and it's not a sandbox! It's a poorly made 3rd person coverbased shooter that goes from bad cutscenes to bad gameplay back to bad cutscenes. THERE IS A FORCED TUTORIAL MISSION AT THE BEGINING CALLED 'CROSS THE BRIDGE' OR SOME ♥♥♥♥ AND YOU MOSTLY CROSS THE BRIDGE IN ♥♥♥♥ING CUTSCENES!!!  Bottom line the Postal series is a game set in a shared universe that is full of crude, immature shock comedy... and that isn't a bad thing. Frankly, I'm nostalgiaic over the first one. I played it a lot as a kid and at the time I took the whole thing as a big joke meant to offend people (which a great portion of it reall is just that), and my cousin played it, I shared it with all my friends back when I had the physical copy...

"A very boring rpg. Unless you have many free hours to kill, I recommend you stay away from this game. I was able to get 9 hours in before I made the decision to drop it for better games. Everything about the game was just too boring. The combat was super easy, the class system was average and the quests and story just didn’t have the right hook to get me interested.  The combat seems fun at first but then you quickly realize just how easy and frustrating it is. Enemies are generally dumb or cheesy. You can either face roll enemies or have no ability to dodge correctly, thanks to the wonderful camera and dodge system. You can try to dodge out of the way of an attack but occasionally the camera will be in such a spot that you instead dodge head first into the enemy, taking the damage and then some that you were trying to avoid. This happens more than enough to be frustrating. The quests and story is what truly killed this game for me. The beginning of the story is very bland and almost feels unoriginal. You come back to life after being dropped onto hundreds of decaying corpses to find out now that you have come back, you now have no fate and can change destinies. It seems like a cool concept but it’s surrounded by so many mediocre and cliché rpg elements that it drowns itself. I looked up the ending to the game to see if it redeems itself but let me tell you no, it does not. The story might have been more exciting if it wasn’t consumed by the hundreds of similar rpg quest tropes. Most of the quests turn into looking for a monster to kill, finding a missing person, and picking up items off the map or enemies.   I really wanted to like this game, I was excited for it when it came out but I held off on it hearing that it was just boring repetitive gameplay. Now that I was able to get it off Steam for cheap I have to say, they were right. Don’t bother playing this game. If you really have to though wait for a sale and make sure you have 20+ hours to dedicate to it.",0,1

"Avoid this one! It plays like an old school HoMM, but it is just broken. The AI will gobble up mobs (and almost always be higher level), yet when you fight it behaves incredibly simple and very easy to predict/control. There is very little deviation in troop layout, the battle maps are extremely small, and movement is very limited. All combined makes for almost no deviation in strategy. You'll find one (maybe 2) strategies that work and that's it! Don't bother trying to have fun, just repeat the same strategy for every single fight and walk around the map some more. Oh wait, sometimes you have to buff your army before a fight. I guess that makes it refreshing and new.  I really wanted to like this game. I liked the first 2 Disciples, and I like the HoMM style of gameplay. The graphics are nice too. But, this game is just broken.",0,1
"It feels like an attempt at an action MMORPG where they ran out of time to complete the networking so they just released it anyway as a singleplayer game. The combat is mediocre at best with no depth so it gets repetitive, requiring you to spend hours levelling before you can begin to do anything slightly diverse. It feels kind of unresponsive because some animations for attacks take so long and you can't even dodge-cancel out of them. The world is really big and beautiful though but ultimately meaningless without good gameplay. The camera is also really close, so close it's almost nauseating.",0,1

"I really wanted to like this game, and I do in part. This was better on the consol. The camera angle is horrible and the fact that you can't target really crushes it for me.

"This game is a timeless classic. It's one of the perfect FPS' that will ever be made. The movement, wall spamming, hitboxes, and map choices are what make this game the best. I've been playing this game since around 2003. Have played tournaments, been an admin for many clans, and strat caller for matches. This game takes serious skill to get good at. There is a huge learning curve, and that's what seperates this from other games, and noobs and pro's. The people who will get good at this game, are the ones who put the time and effort to learn everything. While the game can be a pick up and play game. Expect your ♥♥♥ to get handed to you, as veterans of the game still heavily play this, and they'll out shoot you 9/10 times. I have been called a cheater countless times in this game, and it all comes from me playing this day and night as a child, and my skills has also transferred into other FPS games. If you get good at CS, you'll more than likely be very good at other FPS games like Over Watch, CoD, 007, etc. Thats why I nominate this game for, The “Test of Time” Award. My friends think I'm dumb for playing a game developed in the 90's, but there's a reason for it. As I said, this game is the perfect FPS. It's a game I will play until I die. I can buy any new game on the market, and I'll be returning to this game shortly after. Take it from someone who has invested a lot of time in this game to get good. It's going to seem scary at first, as you will get rekt. But you will develop friends from within the various communities, and you will get better over time. And this skill set will make you better at other FPS games. CS 1.6 forever!",1,0

"This game is overly long with way too many areas and quests for such a non-epic storyline. The art style just didn't seem to mesh with a narrative written by R. A. Salvatore. Combat was repetitive and boring as well with boss fights that weren't memorable...seriously, I can't describe a single boss sequence from this game, and I played it from start to finish and completed all quests in each area (I really shouldn't have wasted my time on that). Yeah, this game does a great job to suck you in, but it's about as addictive as World of Warcraft but without the payoff.",0,1

"Prototype is a really good open world PS2 game.   Yes, it was built for newer consoles, and on PC it should look even better, but for some reason it just feels like it's a Playstation 2 quality game. Every task feels samey, the enemies are boring, and the acting feels like it did before anybody with any decent acting ability would voice characters in a game. I find it impossible to care about anything that happens.  Despite all that, if this game actually had come out for the PS2, or for the PC at the same time as, say, Star Wars Battlefront, it would have been amazing. I would have loved it, and I would have played it for hours on end. Now, however, it's just filled with that sense of disappointment you get when you go to play a game from your childhood that you loved (GTA3, for example) and it's just terrible by today's standards.   For a better super-jumping, punch-exploding open-world experience pick up Saints Row IV when it's on sale. It's better on every possible level, unless your only deciding factor is whether or not a game has zombies.",0,1

"i only bought this for zombies. i hate cod. this one is one of the worst despite what fanboys might say. like all cod games the mp is uninspired, and more of luck/spray and pray based than any kind of skill oriented shooter. the single player is plauged by HUGE issues that should have dissapeared years ago, constantly respawning enemies until you reach a certain point, enemies spawning out of mid air (ive come into rooms only to be confronted by a lmg popping into existance out of nowhere in front of me, and the squad ai serves as only a distraction to the equally ♥♥♥♥ enemies. your squad seems unable to kill targets 3 feet in front of them and they constantly tell you to move up and complete tasks without any kind of covering fire etc. it breaks immersion and comes across as just plain stupid. hey you go shoot 3 tanks with an rpg while being nade spammed and rushed by enemies while we sit behind cover and let u do all the work! its uninspired and LAZY. its artifical difficulty. games are supposed to be harder based on clever design not constant nades every 2-3 second and useless ai that gets in ur way when you try to run away. ive been killed more times from being blocked by my squad than by making mistakes. its broken and stale. which is really dissapointing considering the interesting setting. i cant see why anyone would like this game when there are much better cleverly crafted shooters on the market that dont use nade spam as a crutch for difficulty. return to castle wolfenstien is a good example of a shooter done right. if u can get it on sale for the zombies mode it can be worth it as mods can make it its own game alone, however the base game (what the game is meant to be) is a 5/10 at best. poor design does not =good difficulty . ive been playing shooters my entire life and am a smfc in counterstrike. skill is not an issue. give this one a pass unless you like zombie mode, there are much better options, that are much more worth the money.",0,1

"Initially this was a good game... no really- it was. I Mean who doesn't enjoy dropkicking helicopters to death in a 'free roam' environment. between a massive slew of unlockable powers and movement mechanics, some really stylish animation, and overall addictive gameplay- this game has a lot going for it. However, between a thin story (It could've been a lot better if there was just more character depth) and some maddeningly bad boss fights *cough* elizabeth green *cough* and the abysmel slew of bugs that invariably result in stunlocks and instant death- the latter parts of the game will probably leave you feeling like you should go play contra to unwind. for a game released in 2009 to have so many weird bugs is. well... not so great. Especially from a publishler like activision. Still the bugs arn't so bad as to completely ruin the game. All in all i'd give it a 6 out of 10. The animators did great, the graphics, for the time, are OK. (Would be better if not clearly aimed at consoles) the story and gameplay itself could be a little more solid. Still worth buying if you catch it on sale, but be prepared to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at a couple poorly designed boss fights, the ocassional unavoidable stunlock, enemies running around at mach 12, and the autotargetting system leaving you spinning in circles at 90mph.",1,0

"The game in which the COD-series began to get worse, although I liked the single player campaign very much. The multiplayer section I really cannot recommend, due to the too hectic nature of the online experience. Everybody just runs around with multiple badass weapons and a loadout of superhuman perks. Just like the wet dream of an 8-year-old. On top of that we see the gunship who comes in when a camper gets a killstreak, and who seems to be able to kill dozens of enemies in or out cover, does not matter whatsoever.

"1999 is when this came out, but when I was born. Gladly though I grew up to find out and discover about this magnificent piece. There was no other game that I played once I purchased this with some B-Day cash on Steam. First time playing, I got mutilated like the noob I was, but when I started playing more often, I became better and everyone else can too.   This isn't like the CODs or Battlefields that I have played here and there today. No it's much more different. Counter-Strike is a Tactical FPS which relies on teamwork and tactics more than fast paced arcade action. You don't unlock weapons, you buy them with cash earned from kiling enemies, completeing objectives, or winning rounds although you still get a little for loosing. Think of the game as Cops &amp; Robbers. Robbers blow things up and the Cops don't them too.  On the extra note, this game has probably one of the best modding communities out there. There too much to do or put in here but I can slam a bit down. -Zombies Survival/Escape -Soccer (Or Football for the Europeans) -Surf -Bhop/KZ (Climbing Zone) -Pokemod -Gungame (Those new may have heard such from Call of Duty's spinoff) -And more, etc.  So now that I've explained the game I guess I can lay down some pro's yet con's to playing Counter-Strike 1.6  PROS -Fun/Unlimited Gameplay possibilities -Booming community that has been alive for 15 years -Plethora of servers to choose from -Competetive and Casual at the same time -Fun to play with a group of friends -More skill based than many other games out there -Cheap price   CONS -Graphics from 1998 may seem slightly offputting -Not an easy game to jump right into, as it takes lots of time to become better -May seem repetitive after a while  I came into CS late.

After taking a break from the game for many months, I log in to find out that my STEAM ID has been banned from the servers, when I asked Aeria why they refused to give me any information, they just copy and pasted nonsense about sending them the last 5 transaction ID's plus 6 other rediculous questions that I couldn't possibly answer to get my account back.  0/10 will not Aeria ever again.",0,1

"Anyone considering getting this game at this point, because the price has come down to 10 bucks... don't. On a functional level, it's not playable. The control scheme is not for most people, and you will cause yourself carpal tunnel syndrome from spinning the mouse in rapid circles while holding a button to charge up. That's if it starts up. And considering it's been abandoned by the creators, there's no bug support if it won't. Beyond the technical issues, the plot and styling of this game is in some of the most poor taste I've ever seen, from fake Chinese speach clearly thought up by white people to blatant homophobia I get the uncomfortable feeling isn't actually joking, it really has all the most reprehensible behavior you'd expect from fratboys. If this crap was done in the guise of joking, it'd be comparable to if a standup comedian delivered a KKK-grade black joke and then spent five minutes yelling 'ISN'T THAT FUNNY!?' at an audience that clearly doesn't agree. If you want a game that's playable or has a well-designed, non-offensive story, this one probably isn't for you. If you have no taste, waste ten bucks and see if it even runs for you. For my money, I'd be better off burning 10 bucks for warmth or literally eating it. It was on sale for $2.50 (I believe 90% off at the time) when I got it and I still want my money back.",0,1

"I should have listened to all the bad reviews for this game and not bought it, but not for the reasons I thought...  when I started the game it was stuck at 1080 x 800 p or something like that. which means I could not get it to go fully full screen no matter how hard I tried.  I was ok with this though. to me the gameplay was worth it, enough to bypass this.  then I found out how the music just wouldn't play much outside missions menu's and combat. again I was ok with this.  I was even ok with the fact that most of the voices did not work forcing me to read subtitles.   I imagined everyones voices pretty well in my head.  but then came the thing I was not ok with. I call it the stupidly complicated frustrating mission of ultimate bullsh*t!!  it starts of with you entering a science base. I totally messed up at the stealth but got in anyway. I thought the game was quite forgiving, and I was so so wrong...  right after getting in and watching a cutscene I am told to lead these big tanky infested zombie things to a military base. and they one of THE most rage inducing stupid enemy designs ever!  they can run faster then you, chuck stuff at you with perfect aim and worst of all their close combat attacks track you. its like they have hacked aimbot into their fists!!  sure you can doge them if you run around like a mad man like i did, but to really hurt them you need to hit them with close combat combos, and when you do they just go 'NOPE F*CK YOU!!' and interrupt it with an attack that is faster than yours.  then they stunlock you until you are nearly dead. so the game ever so helpfully recommends that you kill them for more health. you could always try to kill other things for more health like enemy soldiers but they like to focus on you and only you.  so when you do try that they beat the sh*t out of you until have have as little health as you started with.   but the mission... oh the mission you fight them on is so much worse...  first 3 of them come in and you have to kill them all, then 8 more after that and 10 more after that!  all the while alex mecer (main guy of the story. the one you play as) is saying stuff like 'bring more! ill kill them all!' and 'i could take on a 100 more!' NO YOU CANOT YOU STUPID LITTLE BABY! NOW SHUT UP!!  so then after running around in circles like a mad man while the miltary shoots them like I did, or you somehow mange to kill them by yourself (in that case I am in awe of you!) you are told to blow up a bunch of fuel tanks to kill the stunlockers of doom, by using the rocket launchers and granade launchers that are impossible to aim, while somehow not getting stonlocked to death.  once you do that it triggers a cutscene were the zombie monsters are killed by the explosions.   only moments before they were face tanking 12 rockets at once!! so the fuel tanks explode the monsters die, and alex mercer stands right there as the ENTIRE BUILDING FALLS ON HIM!! without taking a scratch when ingame rockets do hurt him!!  the players reward for all that? a smug c*cky grin from alex mercer and bullets in your face as more soldiers shoot you right afterwoods.  just die already you stupid game and stupid baby face alex mecer!   3/10 already anyoing issues, game crashes for some,it won't even start for others and controller breaking frustration.",0,1

"World isn't immersive as the quests are very similar to MMO's. No challenge or effort put into them whatsoever.  Combat system is highly similar to Fable 2 and Fable 3.

None of my in-game accomplishments really matter in the game world because everyone praises you no matter what you do.  You could scratch your bottom, rub your crap-stank fingers on a princesses nose and she will praise you for being the saviour of humanity. It's horse wank.   I don't know what to call this game. RPG?

Anyone having problem with TimeShift at the startup as:  Incompatible Video Driver (17.10.1315) TimeShift will not run optimally and may crash or freeze without the proper video drivers. It was detected that your drivers need to be updated. Please download and install proper video card drivers.

"Was it good then? Probably. Is it good now? Hell no.  It might just be me, but I really don't find the appeal behind this game in 2016 - whatever year it is now. Global Offensive and Source are the series' best for me.  Don't get me wrong, I love games from this era like Quake, HL1 and I still enjoy those more than newer entries, but I just can't see why you would buy this when CS:GO is miles better for a tiny increase in price. In this case, its a matter of whether the game holds up against it newer entries or (by itself) and I just don't feel that this fulfills those properties.",0,1

"The game is actually good, just not for the price.  I picked this up for three dollars, it came with another game and it was at Dollarama in a physical case. I figured multiplayer on Steam was a thing, since I originally bought a copy for my friend from the same Dollarama and noticed it had steam.  I'm a bit disappointed that it still doesn't exist, same with a lot of features that you'd expect. However, it seems to be ready for multiplayer to be added, as well as the ability to support never-incoming workshop content, since the mods are all really simple reskins.  The game is very simple and fun, and the story is mature, B-movie level garbage, as if Kung Pow: Enter the Fist was directed by Cheech and Chong.   If anyone can find Mr. Healey and get him to mend in workshop and multiplayer or pass the license off to someone willing and capable, it might do a whole hell of a lot better, rather than abandoning it for the PSN version, or even the iTunes comedy doodle version.  Worth 3 bucks, not 10.",1,0

"THe game has an interesting combat system and would acutally be fun ... if it was not completely overloaded with sidequests to the point where I simply gave up because I felt so swamped that I had no fun playing anymore.  A linear questline with some sidequests is fine, I even love a ton of sidequests as long as they are structured in any way but as it is here you pretty much can get a quest from every second npc wandering around. They should have put those gazilion quests onto a notice board or something so you can pick those single quests all at once. Also the quest-tracker needs to be a lot better in a game with this many quests. Maybe creating chains would also help instead of single 1-3 step missions.  I bought this game on sale, so not much money lost, still I regret the buy a bit.  In the end, do not get me wrong this can be a very nice game, the combat is interesting, I like the style and it has a lot of audio content (pretty much everything is spoken so there went a LOT of effort into this part of the game - even if some of the actors sound royally bored) ... BUT and this is a big but: this game is only for you if you have a massive amount of time and like running in circles to finish missions for days on end and do not get frustrated by overwhelming amounts of go-there-kill-that-come-back quests. If you are looking for a game that you can go up against for a really long time, pick this one up, if you like even a resemblence of structure (and I am not talking forced lineare gameplay, open world is fine as long as there is some structure that keeps you from getting totally lost) skip it.",0,1

Dont buy it unless you have played Postal 2 as it could put you off the series  This on the other hand is a complete knock up of a game, its buggy and its incomplete.  Theres no way the game can be fixed because akella wont release the source code to RWS . Why !?  couldnt they just make more money if the game was better? i dont know the polotics and im not bothered...them &amp; running with scissors issues not mine   So basically a badly broken game, bugs glitches, no crashes for me but others have said they had them.

Worst game I've ever played. ♥♥♥♥ off Activision,0,1
"So, I originally downloaded this game to get the Black Rose, then uninstalled after 1 game after seeing how terrible this game is. The menus are so confusing and cluttered, it's really hard to find anything. Only thing I could do was click 'Quick Join'. I jumped into a game of Team Deathmatch on some Christmas map, which was one the worst maps I've ever played in an FPS, however I'm not sure if it was official or modded, if it was official, this game's maps suck hard. First thing I noticed was that I couldn't change my settings in-game, which meant I was stuck on an extremely high sensitivity all game. Second thing I noticed is that this game is UGLY. Seriously ugly. The ADS is one the worst things I've ever seen, it literally takes up the whole screen and is very hard to use and looks bad. The paid guns are extremely overpowered and from what I've heard that real money shop is a rip off. After a game that lasted far too long, I checked if I had the Black Rose and uninstalled.  This is the worst F2P shooter I've ever played, the gameplay is just boring, unbalanced and just not fun at all, the game has bad graphics and some of the worst menus I've ever seen outside of JRPGs.  0/10, don't play it unless you want the Black Rose.",0,1

"Timeshift is the prime example of a good concept (time manipulation) badly rendered. The story in itself is utterly slim and unattractive (and with quite the erratic narrative) : a scientist, Krone, decied to found his own empire in an alternate timeline and you go after him. The end. No surprises, no twist, no incentive to continue.  The hero is a soulless mute, joining the Resistance just because and being ordered around, while nobody bats and eyelid at a suit guy appearing from nowhere and able to manipulate time around him. There's a grand total of two timejumps !  But well, story is not meant to be the strongest point of a FPS. Problem is, the gameplay is also lacking. Not that it plays badly- on the opposite, it plays quite smoothly. But the game is far too easy. Your ability to slow time, combined with the quick regeneration of your health and a genous cooldown for time-controlling abilities, makes you near-invulnerable if you stay cautious. The game compensates by unleashing hordes of brainless soldiers, but it just makes the fights longer, not more interesting. The puzzles are short of anything creative. A puddle of electrified water ? Stop the time, the water is solidified, go unscathed. The bridge is collapsing ? Activate return, walk on it as it goes back in time for your needs. It won't challenge your intellect, rest assured.  The weapons feel good, especially the explosive crossbow, but in the end you feel like you spend most of your times pushing buttons and going back. Cooke, the leader of the Resistance, yelling at you every twenty seconds in some sections till you accomplish the objective is quite unnerving.  The game is mercifully rather short- about 8 hours, without replay value. In a way, it's quite soothing because you stomp the ennemies with your arsenal and slow time capacity, but it was really clunky and uninspired at the time, it's not better now.  If you want a FPS with the Time them and a good dose of humor, try Time Splitters : Future Perfect. Else, even Singularity is more convincing than Timeshift : at least you interact with the world, you're not a mute puppet in a suit.  Surely Saber Interactive is doing better now, but then they have also produced Battle Los Angeles... Not the brightest past.",0,1
"I bought this game on Steam to play Custom Zombies in combination with multiplayer... Zombies do work so far I've tested (just Der Riese so far) and than I tried out the multiplayer. That doesn't work, at all. If I launch the multiplayer a black screen appears and I have to reboot my PC because nothing happens, if I run it in safe mode the main menu layout appears but than again, it freezes and there is nothing I can do... And I'm not the only one. On the CoD WaW forum on Steam there are multiple people with the same problem: black screen. So my advice for this moment: Don't buy the game until there is a workaround.",0,1

"Worst. Game. Ever...  I continued to wait for the game to begin all the way until the credits rolled.   There is so much wrong with this game, i continued to play thinking surely it must get better, but honestly, trust every other review when they say this is the worst game ever.   • The voice acting is terrible, i've heard more heart felt believable conversations with my pet cat. Voice acting isnt a make or break for a game but still its a major minus.   • There is no story!!! Im on a holiday break, the hotel is named after a dead mountaineer, it has a museum room which was once his. Ok. Some one's been smoking in the room and there are some shoes which dont belong there. Hardly a case for Scooby Doo. Then thats kind of it, you spend the entire game following idle tasks with no story, no reason other than to advance the game. then when the end does come you simply dont care.  • It's really slow! You walk everywhere, there is no option to run, even in a hurry 'Quick, we have to get guy on the roof here because his friend is badly injured, slowely walks to roof.' there are some scenes where you can double click and fast travel through the room without having to actually walk the entire room, but yea this plays really slow and clunky.   • You will not care about anyone. I didnt even bother to learn their names, i really wanted this to be a good game, i thought from looking at it a steam sale that it could be good, but no, coupled with the bad voice acting you find yourself unable to connect with any of the characters.   There is a plot twist at the end. at least if there was a plot, there would be the twist but for me and my experiance, it was the beginning of the story, which then ended some 2 paragraphs later. And while im on it, as a plot twist its utterly wank.   Buy this game only if you have played every other game on steam... and only if it comes on sale for £1... and only if you get that £1 from someone else.",0,1

"Recommend not playing this game on hard. The game isn't good enough to warrant the extra challenge it entails. If you're playing because you liked Disciples 2, then you're probably playing for the story (which admittedly isn't very good either). Took me about 120 hours to finish the first campaign. That's with less than 50 turns used per mission, minimal potions and spells, and full clear every map. Pretty brainless for me overall aside from occasional battle rigging, watched One Piece while playing this.  Gameplay: Concept changes all around for the most part but the core difficulty remains approximately the same. A lot of battles need to be rigged to be won or return when higher leveled. Tactics and proper magic usage will for the most part win most battles. If we're comparing difficulty between this game and Disciples 2 (hard difficulty), they are approximately the same but functioning off different systems. You still had to rig battles in Disciples 2 until your hero was OP and magic was also pretty important as well. The critical strike system is pretty bad though. Some new features like the 'guardians' are pretty terrible, rodbearers were exponentially better.   Overall, might be worth buying on sale if you were a fan of Disciples 2 otherwise stick with HoMM series. Game wasn't bad, but it's not worth recommending to the average player.",0,1

Yes, you got some stories about 'telling', Fae's and stuff, but after that you can just name every clishe you will remember.  But again, it's got some potetial.

I would like to update my old review from back in 2014 in January 1st.  I'll keep it short by saying that I wouldn't recommend this game.  The singleplayer is fun but what most people are probably after is the multiplayer which this game is not-so-great with - maybe back when it first came out?  I find I'm lagging constantly (with good internet) and the game also seems to crash a lot telling me there are 'file mismaches' to which I've gone and fixed with the validation of game files to which the game STILL tells me that I have mismatched files.,0,1

It shows that R.A. Salvatore wrote for this game. The only way I could make it bearable was to mod the FoV to be zoomed out to where I couldn't really see the actually quite nice looking characters and equips. I don't see why they couldn't make the camera zoom out in combat to accomodate all enemies you were fighting.  Read the wiki for the story...don't buy the game.",0,1

"I don't really recommend it, But it's up to you all. I played a few days and a few hours. But all i see is Hack servers. Leveling up, people wall hacking, people using cheats to fight there games. There not really doing anything. Just let the aimbot do it for them. I do really miss the fun of the game where it was a challenge, now it's just childs play where people hack there way through. I guess I'll just play on the 360, the only thing I have to worry about is Modded controllers. But I found a way through that, so it's no biggie to play. Just if Punkbuster and other hack shields and stuff were more well equip to handle hacks. I would def. Give this game a 10. But all I see is 2. Half of the game you will mostly find just hack servers. And the rest is just that people are trying to play without having all this trouble. But some want to find hack servers so they wont have to play through. I find alot of unskilled players in this game. But I'll leave it up to you to choose whether this game is for you to play.",0,1

"Postal III is a janky, barely functional mess that has none of the charm, character, or fun of Postal 2. Running With Scissors had little to do with this game and it shows. The game runs like ♥♥♥♥ (if you can get it running at all), and the first person, open world nature of the second game is replaced with boring, medicore, third-person cover based shooting. Oh yeah, don't forget everyone's favorite: A shallow binary moral choice system! Going around on rampages is still somewhat fun, but there is no heart or soul in this game. If you are an abosule, diehard Postal fan, pick it up on sale as cheap as you can if you're into some casual masochism. Otherwise avoid like the plague.  Also, ♥♥♥♥ the Postal Dude's new voice.",0,1
"I would rate this game highly but now the servers are full of hackers, this game has been out what 6 years now? and yet the community on it thats left gives gaming a bad name, so don't pick this up unless your a sad child who wants to hack a game with pretty much dead servers.",0,1

"RECOMMENDED JUST FOR NOSTALGIA, besides that, NOT RECOMMENDED!  It's the father to the modern Counter Strikes and FPS in general. That's a fact, but that doesn't mean you should play this. We have CSGO now, it would be ridiculous to pick up a old, outdated and dying game like CS 1.6. Those who play it do so cause they've been doing it for 15+ years, but no new players arrive and it is too much blocky graphically to be even considered for purchase these days.  Great game, but too old/outdated and dying. Don't recommend, unless you're here to get some nostalgia from the old days. (I still give it thumbs up cause it's still a GREAT game and we can't publish a analysis thinking on the time we are but on the time the game was made, to compare it to it's days instead of current days)",1,0

"There is a lot of good things in Reincarnation, but the AI and map progression issues have not been resolved from the previous versions.  In general:  The Good: -Fun races, lots of units, nice strategic approach. -Nice Music. -Graphically appealing, while not being demanding. Well Optimized. (Not last gen tough). -Good Campaign Storyline. -Almost no bugs or glitches (so far). -Leveling system is addictive and dynamic. Can have different builds.  The Bad: -Horrible AI. Seriosuly.  -Strategic approach is fine, execution is terrible. Weird and unfair issues with CPU enemies. -Extremely slow paced gameplay. -Difficulty is based 100% in the raw power of the enemy armies and it scales poorly as the game goes on. -Once behind it's almost impossible to recover.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Now, explaining with more detail:  1.- Disciples is a franchise that relies heavily into the management of the encounters you have. The main strategy of the matches rely heavily in how you develop your troops WITHOUT DYING, mainly because the game punishes you hard if you loose a leveled squad. In the past, this kind of difficulty was appealing, but by today standards, it's just not well implemented. The game is more about choosing the right targets to level up and not about the strategic combat. This means that the difficulty is developed by the way you approach the leveling and not about the challenge of battling or developing the resources.  2.- The AI is just broken.  During the map phase, all the enemy armies just clean the mobs and level up in a certain rate, making few mistakes, while you need to see your way trough the random neutral troops that can range from easy to impossible. While the idea of having a linear leveling experience is boring, making you roam the map searching for the right mobs seems hardly an improvement. This is worsened by the fact that you can't afford to loose a single troop from the squad, so you will be repeating certain battles just for the sake of keeping the squad alive and not loose time in healing (wich, too, can be punishing in certain situations). And you can add to this the fact that while you loose time choosing targets, the AI already knew the right path so now it's 3 levels abobe you and still power-clearing camps.  In combat is worse. Melees will approach to engage, ranged will target the nearest high priority target (weakest). No much variation there. All the difficulty relies in you having to clear the lesser troops because usually the neutral enemies will have an outstanding threat that you need to carefully engage if you don't want to get one-shotted. And that is all. It's an easy clean or a fight you will have to repeat until the mobs behave the way you needed or until certain platforms that give you power spawn in better positions for you (wich ends up being the only strategy that the field of battle provides and that is completely random. The AI will rarely use them well).  -While fun and useful when you level and clear the map, spells are rather secondary. They can be extremely necesary in certain maps that have incredible neutral camps difficulties; and be just a fun thing to do in other scenarios.   Don't get me wrong with this review. Reincarnation is still a good game. It pretty much is a revamp of disciples 2 with a new combat system that is not really that cool. But i can hardly recommend it with all the issues it haves. Gaming has gone a long way from the games that had broken gameplay and weird AI issues. D3 should have been the improvement in those departments and not just the downfall because they not only couldn't fix them but maked them worse.  There were other minor issues, but i settled with the most important in my opinion. To do this review i waited to play enough time, but now I felt like I was ready to give an honest, objective opinion about the game.  Cheers! ",0,1

"I managed to get half-way through PROTOTYPE and ended up writing over my save file in an act of confusion, all because the developers made one of the worst PC ports I've ever played. There's no chance I'll be playing through all of this again anytime soon.  Here's the main issues I had with what would be an otherwise fun and enjoyable game:  • Shadows are completely nonexistent for those who have AMD graphic cards.  • It's impossible to continue without having the game crash. In order to fix this you need to start a new game with a new save, quit back to the main menu after the first cutscene, and then load your original save file. This is where I got confused, after not playing for so long, and managed to save over my old file.  • The volume in this game is extremely low. I play with headphones, for almost every game I'll usually set the volume to around 40% through the little controller on my headset. I find it hard to hear at 100% with PROTOTYPE, there's no other way to increase the volume.  There are no fixes for these issues, there's no FOV slider which would help with how claustrophobic the screen is. The developer went bankrupt and no one gives a ♥♥♥♥ about the people who bought this in such a broken state, so I insist you not waste your time and money or you'll only end up as frustrated as I am right now.",0,1

"This game appears to remain No. 1 FPS Action games since 2000 for around 8 to 11 years. It is a intense game as your health and your exposure is important as well sticking together with your team mates at all costs. You should maybe try this game and learn the routes in common CS maps like dust or assault. Go on try it!  However they are a several downsides to this game like the weapon nerfs like the recoils and smoke grenade failing to detonate airborne and the lame Tactical Shield. And cos this game is so popular that thousands of servers host this game online, that some PC criminals tend to take advantage on players like using hacking or server addon hacking materials. So you maybe best to stay clear of weird or dodgy servers with extreme adult material and Steam cannot unban victims who got hijacked and VAC banned, so please be careful!  But if you are old and wise enough to handle this intense action game...BUY IT, SOLDIER!",1,0
"My god..this game. This game is by far the worst game ever I have ever played in my entire life and what will be the rest of it. I gave a positive review to Bad Rats, a game about terrorist rats that massacre and desecrate cats among other animals. But.. this f-ucking game, this game is the worst thing I have ever lied my eyes on. I after downloading it for an excessive amount of time as it is way too large for a game that has no content I started it up just to see I had to spend another 45 minutes in the game launcher installing patch and updates. I started a character, FPS dropped almost instantaneoulsly. I saw before my eyes,the worst game ever, terrible graphics, disgusting rendering, the worst optimization of any game, even of all games by Unity combined. It was like looking at a dead baby fetus get cut open and sucked through a sick persons mouth. It was the most disgusting and revolting thing I've ever laid my eyes on.   I changed the graphic settings and options to lowest. Now,keep in mind, I can run Arma III on high perfectly fine around 30 frames-per-second, but this game even on the main menu on several graphical settings, I can only run it 10-15 laggy fps at times, the mouse stutters and it feels like my brain is being put through a blender. I can feel the heat of the game, the complete aftermath of the warmth of the aspect of radiation surrounding the game after getting completely and brutally ♥♥♥♥♥. I started the tutorial only to see my frames per second drop to 1-3 at a time. I felt like I was getting several blows of a metal bat to the head. I felt light-headed, queazy and nauseous. I felt the pain and my stomach drop like someone had a knife at my throat, ready to end my life, if that was the real situation,at this point,I would've wanted to die.   The game was popping up with blaring alerts and irritating notifications while the volume was excessively loud even though I had it at a regular level. I saw someone running but when I tried to press WASD, the game was stuttering and trying to keep up with the horrific graphical settings. I could barely set a foot forward when the unexpected happened. One of the worst games and terribly looking and shouldn't require any processing power completely crashed after a 2-4 minutes freeze. It was just looking at someone get murdered,it was pathetic and sad. I started it back up,after waiting almost 15 minutes trying to get back to the tutorial,I finally set foot out,it was popping up with random messages that were laggily appearing and disappearing, sounds were going on and off while horribly acted and scripted voices were yelling at me like a few immature autistic kids acting out a play on a playground. It wasn't worth it. All of this was not worth the torment I was being required to suffer through to even play the tutorial for more than five minutes. I was barely just moving around aftering getting yelled pointless instructions at me when the unexpected happened again. It f-ucking crashed again.   I wasn't sure if I could start it up again,it felt like my head had just been cleared. It was as if I was experiencing the worst headache that anyone was to suffer to date and it was instantaneously cleared with no side effects. The game was closed, I didn't think I could handle anymore, I hovered my cursor over the uninstall button craving the pleasure of clicking it and ridding this blight from my PC,my life and as I hoped, my memory. I looked back,thought maybe..just maybe I could suffer through such crucial torture, one more time. I started the game up,feeling droggy. It was as if I was all of a sudden drugged,it felt like I was beaten,thrown into a vehicle,droven miles out to nowhere and thrown out in a field. I felt empty,alone, this game made me feel worse than I can even describe with words,no matter what I see in an enemy, no matter how much I hate someone even with the largest amount of malice,never in my life would I wish someone to have to suffer through the pain that is playing this disgusting excuse of a game. Looking through which seemed to be at this point blurred vision, I saw the horribly designed and just plain gross menu screen. I felt the horror of my past, every memory that seemed to be low points in my life,the horrific memories,I saw myself so desperate at this moment,even craving these moments in exchange at any moment for the release of this pain.    All I wanted now was the sweet release of death, to die rather than see another moment of this game as I clicked on a button to join a match after struggling for several moments trying to sluggily getting through a plethora of banners and ads. I managed to get through it like a maze meant for masochism and pure struggling and frustration. I had finally joined a match,I was okay,I got through it. I made it, I finally made it through the amount of torture I could finally experience. I finally met my complete and full capacity for pain and torture and I was done. I thought I was done through all of this,my frames per second were at zero but I was fine now,I was alright, I could give up now. I had such a high thrist for death, never in a million years I would've thought I could desire this so greatly but at this moment, I was.. and now, it was the only thing in my life that I truly wanted. Then the most depressing and relieving thing coinciding together happened. The game crashed.    I was rid of the pain. I was rid of the sorrow that this game was. I felt like crying but it felt like my memories had been partially exasperated, that the truly evil things in life were gone, the rest of my life would seem to be easier, to be a cake walk, because I had barely made it through this journey that is Alliance of Valiant Arms and I survived after being completely physically exhausted. I was emotionally exhausted. And finally, I was to the fullest extent, mentally exhausted. I had never had such a desire for everything to just fade away, the desire for it all to be quenched. Though,I was relieved and possibly a future patient of post-traumautic stress disorder now after experiening this long and bitter journey. I was done. I felt sorrowuful but I slowly installed the game watching it's memory and mark it left on my computer disappear..forever.So I only have one thing to say to this gam- no, this excuse for a bit of space in this world, this direct spawn of Satan. The most miserable thing that has ever crossed the plane of life and this Earth. 'F-uck you!'  ",0,1
"I want to like this but the camera is just plain awful. When you aren't in combat it's too close to the character so that you can't see a thing going on around you, and when you are in combat it tries to zoom out to give you a good perspective but often your character will just go off the screen. Often in the game I was just spamming buttons because I couldn't even see myself or the enemies. It's terrible at following the character and hard to put up with for a game that has hundreds of hours it expects me to sit through.",0,1

"When I was younger I really enjoyed this game. I enjoyed the campaign. I enjoyed the multiplayer. I enjoyed the guns. Everything.

I will say that the multiplayer maps themselves are very memorable and it feels good revisiting them. To conclude I don't think this game is worth the 20$ price tag. There are so many better games on here with more to offer that cost less than 20$. So yeah, my opinion.",0,1

"Every review is positive here, so im going to bring up the bad stuff about this game, and what other games does better.  Where do I start?  Your character is glued to the ground to start with. You cannot jump. The map is big, but because of the glued to the ground issue, and the way they built the enviroment, its tedious as **** to walk around in the world. Rocks, tree-roots, rivers and small valleys. Walk around and find the way down/over/around. Tedious. Also, the only way to 'jump' down a valley or such, is to find a small wooden ramp. Then you press F and the character jumps down. The height of these will blow your mind. The world itself is big. Not HUUUUGE like the other wants you to think. Its not a free world like gta or skyrim, you go where they want you to go.   Monsters/enemies. They are not very varied. Same stuff to kill over and over. (Fighting/combat is fun however so its 50/50)  Reused textures/enviroments. Makes me angry, this ♥♥♥♥ right here. The caves that exists everywhere all look alike. Small differences but still big sections are the same everywhere. Kinda ruins the feeling.  Leveling up is fine, so is the weapons dmg, types and so on.  This game has nothing that skyrim doesn't do better. Looting and taking everything in the chest, you have to use the mouse to press 'take all'. And you loot a lot, A LOT. So small irratating things like these are everywhere.  Fighting upphill? To bad, if you have ranged weapons/magic they will go straight forward, into the ground.    Story is ok. Good concept, poorly executed.  PROS: Combat feels nice and looks good, WOW style. Big enemies, bosses and such are really fun to fight.  CONS: The game is EASY. Im playin on hard right now and it feels like easy. This game has nothing on other games in the same genré.  Conclusion: Save your money.",1,0

"First of, the game is horribly buggy and impossible to finish, which sucks, because up until now the franchise was brilliant. Dont get me wrong, the game is beautiful and the story is inmersing, but the bugs completelly break the game, many battles (specially boss battles) are simply unwinnable, therefore so is the game. I wouldnt recomend buying this game, not even in sales.",0,1

"This game is trash rofl  Installed on SSD but it takes 3-5 minutes to launch and I crashed twice trying to load the tutorial. The third time it worked but took another 5 minutes, then I completed the tutorial and tried to go to the second part and the game crashed after loading for roughly 6-7 minutes.   After that I launched the game again but I had to check something so I tabbed out. A minute or so later I tab in and the game crashes (I WAS IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING MAIN MENU)  Pros: Girl with nice ♥♥♥♥ in tutorial  Cons: I literally couldn't play it  I've never had anything installed on my PC that has run as badly as this.

"While OMD is a very cute game, it suffers from some fairly crippling design flaws. Firstly, most of the levels' difficulty results directly from one decision the devs made; instead of allowing choke-points or open spaces or a single path, the people who made this game decided that each level be bifurcated, but provided portals to allow us to traverse the two. Pick one, devs. Difficulty or ease. As well, barricades are among the most expensive single buildables. In this vein, it is much more economically viable to murder all the monsters yourself, as traps are A) very expensive and B) reset much too slowly. So why, for the love of Atheismo, is there only a 'cash bonus to trap kills' purchaseable!? Why can't we simply rely on weapons? Oh, right-- because the devs decided to split each level in two, so we can't simply use one route or the other. You're forced to use both the (mandatory) crossbow and (shoddy, unreliable) traps. Still, it's a fun romp, even for its faults and flaws.",1,0
I loved Postal 2 and heck I even enjoyed the Uwe Boll film. But this game kind of sucks to be honest. It has some enjoyable moments here and there but most of the time it just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. The AI can be very annoying most of the time. For example. the mission where you have to escort the slave to City Hall. Every time I shot a paparazzi he would run back and I would have to hit him just so he can follow me. There are also a crap ton of glitches. In the same mission the slave would always get stuck trying to pass through a doorway. I would have to shoot him and keep saving so I can restart. The voice acting was sub par at best. It feels like no one really wanted to be there. I might continue playing the game but that's only because I payed for this and because I loved the second one. I wouldn't be surprised if I just stopped playing because I have better games.,0,1

"The games dead. Its basically worthless to anyone in USA unless you want to play with third worlders. Even then theres only a few servers it looks like. I would rather die than play with South Americans. Anything south of the US border is just hell ( I have never had a positive experience online with these people and if you know anything about geopolitics I need not go into that), so I advise not dealing with these peoples idiocy and just going with CSGO these days unless you want to LAN this game.  One of the greatest FPS games to ever come out and will forever remain a classic but also a game that can still compete design and gameplay wise with games released in more current times. We will never have the natural form of support from players and ESPORTS ever again. This is before ESports was just a way for devs to market and shill a game. This was from when people who liked to play a game competed and not just a bunch of rich kids trying to win monetary prizes like ESports is now (who else could play CSGO all day erry day in this economy?)  People got behind this game because they liked it, instead CSGO is all about market manipulation and human psychology manipulating with less consideration about gameplay because they want the most monetary return. If the idiots will pay hundreds for a digital knife skin then why would any company invest in gameplay that won't have direct returns like a digital nongood would have?  The video game market is full of idiots who will dump money into anything now just so they can distract themselves from the politcs, economics, and slowly declining living conditions of the western world. Bread and circus in its truest form.  CS 1.6 is from better days, more honest days. When people who wanted to make games, and people who wanted to play games were very closely related and the average IQ of someone who was online was higher than now. These days every idiot has an internet connection. That is to say, the target audience then was just better than the target audiences of todays games. This is exampled many times in economics.

"TL,DR: Great idea, terrible implementation.  There is nothing that disappoints me more than lost potential. When I heard about this game, I loved the premise. Be an evil god! Leaping through the city, unleasing your unspeakable power on the hapless citizens! And sometimes, that's what I got. Most times however, what I got was a buggy, lazy, difficult-to-control mess.  I have some ideas what happened here. 1) The open world's so big, and there's so many missions and events and kaka, the designers didn't put all the effort they should have into polishing and playtesting. I can't help but contrast this game against something like Portal, that's small but perfectly tuned. I didn't expect THAT from Prototype, but I would have happily swapped a few missions and events for more time taken working the bugs out of the others. 2) From what I've read of other people's complaints, this is a really lazy port. The fact alone that this started as a console game explains some of my frustration, as there are simply too many options mapped to too few keys, leading to frequent raging when I meant to do one thing and something else happened.  I did finish the game. I finished nearly all of the events. And I'm not just calling a game bad because I sucked at it. In events where I actually felt like I was fighting NPCs instead of gameplay and glitches, I did fine. I got gold in most events, some on the first try. My frustration wasn't from lack of skill, but from things like...  *There are kill missions where you are supposed to use a certain weapon or power. Half the challenge is keeping the game from defaulting to kicking and jumping attacks that won't count towards your score. *Sometimes no matter how much I selected the whipfist, I wouldn't transform into it. No other power had this problem (Until the final boss, where I kept getting locked into previous powers and being unable to change them for a minute or so). *I beat an event with four seconds clearly left on the clock and it said I'd failed it. *Watching my character destroy infected water towers, yet the game says they hatched before I did. *Game gives you incorrect advice on how to proceed with a helicopter mission: 'Hold TAB and flick mouse to select another detector' *I lost track of the number of times NPCs killed off a Web Of Intrigue target before I could get to them. I lost an event MULTIPLE TIMES because of this. *A Consume Event icon on my map; no event or marker in the area when I'm directly at the spot. Followed by a Consume Event marker floating in midair with no corresponding event. *I consume a target in an event, the game says the target died and doesn't count it. I was IN the animation of consuming it! *Accidentally hit escape during an event; this aborts the event instead of pausing the game. *Targeting is gambling. Most of the time my attacks would hit just fine, but sometimes the game would decide that I'd much rather punch a helicopter than the Hunter I targeted. *Sound was really low, even at the highest volume. *Was supposed to protect a tank. Control was taken away from me while the game played a cutscene. During this cutscene, hunters attacked the tank and crippled it. I had absolutely no way to stop them. *Boss battle against a Supreme Hunter. Suddenly 'Objective Completed' without me having done anything, leaving me feeling cheated of a good fight. *I had to kill 100 enemies for an event. At 99 kills, the game stopped producing NPCs so I lost the event. *Timed kill event located in an area with tons of low fences, preventing me from getting to enemies or enemies getting to me. *Frequently getting stuck inside tanks despite clicking 'E' tons of times. *Lost a Movement event twice because the game suddenly put me in my armor, which meant I dropped out of parkour and lost precious seconds trying to get the armor off.  And you know what? I could forgive all of that, but the final straw was how TWO CUTSCENES THAT OCCUR DURING MISSIONS WILL CRASH THE GAME, MEANING YOU WILL HAVE TO START THOSE MISSIONS ALL OVER AGAIN AFTER YOU RESTART. The cutscene plays; fade to black; game is completely frozen. And it wasn't just me: I saw many, many people on many different websites describing the crash in The Stolen Body and Men Like Gods. Supposedly it's a corrupted audio file. It's unforgivable that this hasn't been patched by now.  So yeah, there were moments of occasional triumph. I liked a lot of the powers, the whipfist especially. when the game worked, it actually did feel pretty damn great. But those moments were rare. This was a game where 'flow' should have happened way, WAY more than it ever did. I got this for five bucks during a Steam sale and feel ripped off.  Also, I'm gonna be hearing those bedamned military alarm sirens in my sleep for weeks.",0,1
"It's simple. Terrorist x CTs Few minutes to complete objectives. The more you play, the better you get.

"I've played deeper mobile games. It plays like one of those touch screen dive bar games.  I'm a big fan of the weird RPG-Poker niche subgenre of games so I was pretty excited about this, but it lets down in every way possible.  This game is basically just a battle system, there is very little connecting fight to fight. Simplistic map and boringly presented text and portrait story. That would be fine if the battle system had anything going on... but it doesn't.  The battle system has an interesting idea buried in it, but nothing is done with it. All the magic in the game is just *DO X-Y Damage* *Block X points of Nature Damage* There is no cards for board or number or hand manipulation. This makes collecting cards seem pointless because none of them actually change your play style. The way you play your first battle is how you play your last. There is also zero consequences for death so battles have no tension.  As for the RPG mechanics... well there aren't really any. Your HP and MP go up at set story points and I guess you can choose to cast a spell that does X points fire damage or X points nature damage, but there is so little reason to bother I can't see why you would.   Story is okay, I guess, soundtrack is decent, but I can't imagine that being enough to get you through this mindless slog. If you ever thought 'I wish I had to click through a bunch of text between Freecell games' then this might be for you.",0,1

"Counter-Strike has come a long way and to see this game really brings out how much it has come. I feel as this game is not just a time waster but a reason to still be on the Internet. But In 1999, I crawled out of Counter-Strike’s wretched ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to become the man I am today. And, now, I’m tasked with rating the game. How does one even rate his mother?  In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.  Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.

This one certainly looked nice when looking at the screenshots and reading the intro. But when you get in the game there's nothing happening. One wanders around the hotel, clicking through all the dialogs, picking up stuff, solving a few puzzles, yet still doesn't get any idea what this game is about.  And that's the main problem. I couldn't figure out what to do! The dialogs are stiff and boring and I got sick of seeing the same scenes over and over again as I had to constantly clicking my way through the hotel.  Summary: Spend your money on another game. This one is no fun and is one of the very few adventures I actually stopped playing. I didn't event want to consult a walkthrough.

"I could only play three levels of this game. I think by that admission we know where this review is going.   I don't know why I bought this game, if it was in a bundle, or if I mistook it for another time game, what ever the reasons, I wish I could give it back. It's not that it's a horrendous game, but with a name like Timeshift, you have a lot of great possible features that will blow a players mind.   This game though doesn't do any of them. This is a very by the numbers shooters with a time power that is almost mandatory. In the first three levels, you constantly feel overwhelmed, but the time power doesn't really make up for it, a lot of this game is use the time power, shoot a few people, hide again wait for the time power (And health) regen, do it again.   The abilities you have in the game are interesting, but the game overall is quite uninteresting. The story is weak, the gameplay is about the same, and the graphics... well the first level is a dull grey, with enemies running around, and while there's big enemies you can't fight (yet?) overall you're running around dull hallways, shooting dull enemies, running in parks, in drab environments, shooting dull enemies, the game never really evolves beyond the dull lack luster experience that it starts with.  Who knows, the fourth level might be the best level in video games ever, but I couldn't stay interested long enough to e even reach it.

" Pros  Interesting story and awesome finishing moves (I love the finishing move for gnomes). Beautiful graphics. Fast travel system is nice.   Cons  Level design is plain and boring. Every landscape is bare and open and you spend most of the time just running and fighting. There are some nice spots, but the excess space between them makes it feel like forced landscape. Later in the game, detail is stuffed in so small spaces that akward camera system is blocked with all the details on the screen.  Camera system is really akward. It tries to keep all enemies on the screen, which may or may not help the player. Finishing moves will be executed partly outside of camera's view, unless you fight one enemy or enemies are tightly packed together.  Extra story elements that you may ask from NPC don't really add anything. You can't receive extra missions through them or point of intrests. After 30 minutes of game play, I just skipped everything and focused on the main quest.  'Ambush' camera close-ups are waaayy too regular. Every troll/(tribal)demon you meet will get its own 'OMG! LOOK AT THIS MONSTER AT CLOSE RANGE!'-close-up.   Other  I didn't really use crafting system. I created some potions and crafted few items, but it was waste of time because you find better loot from monsters. You can also upgrade items with gems, but that is also waste of time because all the good loot you get from the monsters.   Summary  Interesting story, boring level design, akward camera. Buy it if you like from good story and don't care about running around and fighting every 15 seconds.",0,1

"I would recomend But theres way to many downfalls to this use to be good game. Its mainly Paytowin, Hackers own the game from time to time. The game is fun but Fps is terrible for an old game. The company aeria is not customer friendly and is very careless in the way they run the game. Id rate it a 50 50 Give it a try but theres better games out there.",0,1

"It was a great game in its time, but it has been ruined over the years by the rise of hackers appearing everywhere. I had the game for not even an hour, and I was hacked to level 70. I didnt want that at all, it takes the fun of the multiplayer away from me. Hacked lobbies are too common, and hackers will be found with access to all care packages(unlimited amounts of them), god mode, and unlimited ammo. Now, the story is still great dont get me wrong. But if you came here for the multiplayer I must warn you its not what it used to be. Buy only if you want the story.",0,1

"Comparing the game to CS:GO.    Pros:      Variation in lighting (darker rooms), along with flashlights and nightvision.    No background/ambient sounds in most maps (clear sound) (easier to hear footsteps and gunfire).    You can wallbang most things/walls in most maps.    Buying amunition (more depth in economical strategy).    MP5 ('nuff said)    Movement is much smoother and bunnyhopping is much more consistant and fluent, you feel much heavier in cs:go.    You can run the game on a toaster.    Character selection (I just think its pretty awesome).    Spraying (spray paint), boobs make for a great strategical distraction.    Customizing textures, maps, models ect. is great, you can mod almost anything you want, unlike in CS:GO.    No marketing system (skins), this one is a bit of a debate, personally I'm ok with skins (I've even spent money on it myself), but I prefer to mod a game rather than having to pay for a nice looking gun. Skins, simply put, are a way to milk the players money. Im thankful that CS 1.6 doesn't have this.    CS 1.6 has a classic/nostalgic feel to it, some people will like that, some people won't.    People still play the game, proving the game isn't dead yet.    There are many different and interesting modded game modes in 1.6 such as surfing, zombie, bunny hopping, jailbreak, deathmatch, gungame.     Cons:      Matchmaking in CS:GO is better, it is simpler and places you in a server with people around your level.    Grenade physics are awkward and hard to learn.    Viewing and casting games is much better/easier in CS:GO.    Few weapons are viable in CS 1.6, mostly just the AK, M4, AWP, Deagle and MP5    Sometimes bad/terrible hit registration.    Tactical shield.    No ranking system, personally, I don't care about having a pretty symbols with a bunch of arrows and stars, or having stupid rank names like 'SERGEANT MASTER ELITE SHOOTER PERSON', the only reason I'm putting it on this list is because ranking helps put players with other players that are about the level. In 1.6, any new player will find themselves playing against people leagues better than said player.    I did mention before that modded servers were great, but it can also be a problem, there are few classic CS 1.6 servers that aren't modded, most of them being deathmatch servers with 32 players, it's hard to find normal CS game modes.    Hacking is a issue in CS 1.6, worse than in CS:GO. It's harder to get VAC Banned in 1.6 and there aren't any features like Overwatch in CS:GO, to make it easier to detect hackers.    Servers can change your bindings and send you to other servers, this isn't a big problem as there are ways around it but it's still present.    The game no longer gets any updates, I know this isn't the games fault but there are still exploits and bugs in 1.6.   Some people will agree these pros and cons and some won't. I'm not saying this game is necessarily better than CS:GO, but it sure is a fun experience. I would definately recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games, especially people who play CS:GO. The game takes a while to get used to but once you do, you will find yourself playing this game for days. I havn't played this game too much, so theres probably a lot I'm missing. That concludes my review.",1,0

"The worst bug i've ever encountered! Exodus: the laser sensor locks out after you die once making the game impossible to complete as you need that same key to finish the level (changing controls doesn't help either). It is a great game and I have played it on consoles for years, just disappointed about this glitch that wont likely be fixed since it is such an old game now.",0,1

"Can't say this game is all that great anymore. The single campaign is just not gripping and lasts 5 or 6 hours at best. There are still some people playing multiplayer, but you're SOL if you want to play anything other than Team Deathmatch, Free for All, and Search and Destroy. Really only pick this up if you have nostalgia from playing it on an old console.",0,1

"I find this game is too unrealistic, I know that is the point, but it is more that you have to learn new physics on different courses. It is more frustrating then fun, for me at least. I do not recommend this game if you love minigolf, because it is too arcady.",0,1
"Pay to win and the ping limiter was lifted. infested with brs and ava sells private hacks to everyone. Not like you really need to with the super special painted guns, because everyone know paint adds that extra 20% damage and speed. Better back in the day when ijji kept things in shape. :P Hell half the guns they put out don't even go up on the web page and when they do the stats are wrong and the page looks like a monkey slapped it together. don't play this game unless you want to shell out for hacks or their fancy new good guns you don't get to keep. Aeria ruined the ♥♥♥♥ outta this game, just took a huge steamy dump on it.",0,1

"Not the game, but the port is poor. I booted it up to have major sound issues where everyone talked so fast they sounded like a record skipping. This was atop poor resolution issues, and I coudln't get far enough to say if the controls were wonky or not. Don't buy unless you're willing to play tech support hero to make the game run.",0,1
"This game is essentially a CS:GO ripoff, but with even more microtransactions.  Community is almost dead, game is pay-to-win (but you can do fine without paying).  And, supposedly, the game installs a keylogger called nProtect Game Guard. I still don't know how to uninstall now (unless it isn't a problem anymore?) so if anyone could help, that would be cool.   Edit: It's not nProtect Game Guard anymore. It's now something called Xigncode3. Easier to uninstall and supposedly less dangerous, but still a form of 'keylogger'. ",0,1

"My time played on record only shows single player activity, as STEAM separates the two (single and multiplayer). My total time played in Multiplayer is 970 hours.  Update: Now that the game is infested with hackers, I can no longer recommend it. It isn't a rare to end up in a hacked lobby which will do anything from deranking you to altering your unlocks to changing settings in your mp config file. Playing the game requires keeping backups of all your stats and MP files. More information about this can be found in the forums, so if you are considering the game at this point, be sure to inform yourself about all of the serious issues affecting it. It may not be worth the hassle.  Is the game playable and fun? Sure. And in some instances, when you find a good host and players who want to have an enjoyable time without noob tubes, commando, or other nonsense, it can be really fun. But just beware, it's infested with hacked lobbies, people running exploits, and a less than respectable community. If you can stomach all that, you can find fun in it.  *Original Review:  Quick pacing and nonstop action keeps you moving forward to the inevitable end game of the single player at around a 5 to 8 hour completion time. This is good if you are looking to jump into playing an hour or so at a time as each chapter of the campaign is relatively short. The action on display is compelling and the thrilling score, outstanding militaristic dialogue, and visceral imagery keep things constantly engaging. The story, as epically scaled as it may be, is a little too contrived. Modern Warfare 2 decides to up the ante with a full scale invasion of the United States. The U.S. is under siege and the stakes are high. It is unfortunate then that the reasoning behind the whole ordeal, while tragic, is somewhat farfetched. The multiplayer is excellent, yes, with superb shooter mechanics and fluid gameplay. It is also somewhat rage inducing. Prepare to be noob tubed to kingdom come. That aside, it is fast and great fun.",0,1
Mouse acceleration is extreme. Graphics are okay for an old game but the engine is kindof laggy with frequent frame drops and stutters on a i4790k with r9 290..,0,1
