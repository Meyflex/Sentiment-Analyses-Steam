"I really wish Steam had a 'maybe' recommendation, because this game fits into that. I usually give RPGs about 10 hours to get me hooked, and I gave this one 20 because I heard the story was great and compelling but the story didn't go anywhere during the 20 hours I played. If I hear 'you have to put 40 in to like it' then I say go play an MMO if you're into that.  Overall, the combat is fun. I really liked it, but that might be because you never actually get to use it. You get some new gear and upgrade a few skill points and you're 1-hitting anything your level. Bosses are challenging, until you go into the superpower mode and kill each and every one. Quests aren't very compelling and the talking goes on forever without much reason for me to care about anybody. Not only that but one of the DLC's storylines about giants, which I was interested in, had a glitch that prevented me from finishing it without restarting completely. Awesome.  The graphics are cool and you know what, I wish this game had multiplayer. If it had 2 or even 4 player co-op, it would be awesome. I would have so much fun playing with other people, but the lack of enemies to kill, lack of cares I give, and lack of anything interesting in almost a day playing makes it where I don't feel happy recommending this game.",1,0

"Not a bad game for a genre clone - this wannabe fable wannabe skyrim features gnomes instead of dwarves and Fae instead of elves, but other than that mostly conforms to the tolkien rules. The 'young races,' humans (which are subdivided into skyrim-like factions), are in danger of extinction because of the 'crystal war,' where the Fae 'Tuatha' have declared war because ♥♥♥♥ it, ♥♥♥♥ humans, I guess. The player is in the ever-imaginative position of an amnesiac who somehow has mastery of all weapon types, who wakes up as the Tuatha raid a gnommish outpost and from there I pretty much just stopped paying attention. The story is not very exciting.  The 'Destiny' system, where the player can build themselves between the three fantasy rpg classtypes (if you dont know what those are, this game would not be a great place to enter the fantasy genre), is a great idea, especially if you're a completionist and you want to see what total hybridization has to offer. The way the trees build is a little stupid though - there are like 9 types of weapons and you can put points into one weapon type at a time - if you go for full hybrid, like I did, you pretty much just suck with everything, which is what I expected. The level cap is ♥♥♥♥ing 40, which is GARBAGE - there are about 120 point slots for each classtype, so you can basically unlock a total THIRD of the potential of your game (I used a save editor to give myself more points because it was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). Gold is too readily available and doesn't restrict purchases at all, and the gear tries to be like diablo but it just....isn't. The looting is a little stupid. I'd give this game about a C, it captures attention at first but its flaws just rear up and are impossible to ignore. I loved tossing around chakrams and screw-attacking through people with my warrior-rogue-mage hybrid, but I got so bored I just left-clicked my way through the last third of the game.",1,0

"Best hours I spent in my life (arguably &lt;_&lt;), even after so many years I'm still learning... That's ok because that's what make Counter Srike trully special, the learning curve is so steep that you'll never get bored, if you're up for the challenge of course... This game is the true tactical FPS multiplayer, many new games with fancy graphics try to accomplish what CS 1.6 did and fail terribly.  1.6 needs more love from valve, it was one of the games that made steam a 'thing', hell, back in the day it was the ONLY game to bring loyal users to the platform, the games available at the time were very reduced and steam was just an annoyance, to be completely honest we all hated steam, it was a broken nightmare.  Valve could show some love for their baby... adding trading cards, bg's and emo's or even skins would be a great start... one call only dream.. :)  tl;dr: Steam was very broken and the 1.6 playerbase kept it going, valve should recognize that.",0,1

"Tl:Dr- Black Rose is a pretty great knife 10/10. Guns are 2OP4Me for me and gives off a Call Of Duty vibe. Pros: - Free TF2 Knife - Get Holy Mackeral in game (Like it matters if you die every two seconds anyways.) - (Debatable) Has a Hungergames style gamemode Cons: - Download took forever - Might as well play COD - Really Overpowered guns - Community is basically a COD community. (Direspectful, ECT.) - Pay to Win - Not much room to gunplay in maps - Mixed between Reality and Game world (Painted, Alien type guns, with actual guns and Women get less body armor?) - A sexualized game to attract more attention from Male gamers despite gameplay not being good. - They try to lure people to play this game when they just needs major fixing to the game, like make a whole new game or something. which they try to fix and I praise for (They did a survey, although if they listen to peoples results is up to them). Cons overway Pros way more, so in conclusion I will probably have to downvote, Sorry. -Amethyst ",1,0

"Get it if you want, but there really isn't any reason to. Call of Duty games aren't bad games, but there are so many other better games that there is no point of getting them. Like the Nazi Zombies? Get Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 (this is actually a lot more fun than I thought it would be). Like the singleplayer? Get Wolfenstein 3D, they have about the same depth, or Metro if you're looking for a game with good combat and great singleplayer, or Red Orchestra 2 if you're looking for a WW2 style single player (but it's really not that good). Like the multiplayer? Get Verdun, Red Orchestra, or Rising Storm. They all do it better, and even if they are a little different, trust me, you'll have more fun with them.",1,0

"The only negative thing I could find (apart from the difficulty of obtaining the Black Rose and the virus, as people claim) was the thought given to naming the classes.  Rifle Man, Sniper, and Point Man. I understand not wanting to have any similarity to Team Fortress 2, for example, but you got to think your names through. Another alternative would be to give the classes real names.  Lastly, I personally think players are more interested in video games that have a backstory to them. Take Team Fortress 2. The comics explain a great deal of things that happen in-game.  In conclusion, I would give this game 4 out of 10 stars.",1,0

Gaming gear used: There was also a problem with my logitech rumblepad, I had to disconnect it to get the game working properly. I had it plugged in for another game but obviously this game does not like that. I used my mouse and keyboard for this game.  Recommend: No. If it only had an autosave/save function then I´d would have voted positive surely.",1,0

"Okay let me first start off with saying this... This game is NOT worth $20!!!!!!! If you're really wanting to get this game, please do yourself a favor &amp; wait until Steam puts it up for sale. May be a while down the road, but I imagine they will eventually.  Having played this game for several hours, I have gotten into several modded servers. Granted, getting into a normal server was as easy as backing out &amp; searching again, but the thing is, this game sees like 600-800 players MAX on a good day. So you're not always going to be able to back out &amp; get into a normal server. You will sometimes back out &amp; then just rejoin the same modded server.  The negative aspect out of the way, this is still the same old MW2 you played years ago. It plays just the same &amp; when you DO get into a noraml server, it's loads of fun! I've never had any issues getting into full servers either, so it's got that going for it.   As far as hackers &amp; modders goes, I have never personally came across one, or if I did, I didn't notice. It's just the modded servers you have to watch out for. Play on those to long &amp; you could get slapped with a VAC Ban!  All in all this is a good game, but i really wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than die hard MW2 fans, or people trying to complete their CoD collection. It's a dying game! Yes it will ALWAYS have a player base, (mainly the hardcore MW2 fans) but if you're just getting into PC gaming, or looking for a new FPS, I would tell you to buy Call of Duty 4 instead. There are 4,000+ ACTIVE servers in that game &amp; the number of active players grow every day!",1,0

"I do enjoy the game, and I think it is a good way to quench your thirst for a game of this style. With more work this game could have really been amazing. An active modding community would even be plenly enough to save it. But sadly we will not be seeing any more progress on it. I suck at adding pros so i'll just be going into the details on the cons. (sorry if i am a bit too harsh)  Worth the purchase?  I would say the game is worth a buy when it is on sale, or if you are like me and don't have a pc able to run things like The Witcher 3 or Shadow of Mordor.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  + Overall fun gameplay and combat. Easy to get into and can find a good amount of things to do.  + The main story is pretty good. Really new and interesting plot.  + The respec system allows you to completely change your playstyle at any point for a small fee of gold.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  - Poor difficulty scaling.  Apparently when you enter a new area, it locks that area to your current level. So if you progress too fast or, like me, end up charging across the map in search of a challenge, the whole game becomes a cakewalk. (besides a few special enemies that do stupidly high damage compared to the rest)  I have heard that this also works for chests, so looting everything too early will hurt you in the end.  - Conversations seem to be lacking. Persuasion skill is useless.  I quickly found myself skipping through dialogue to reach choices to get past it, that often make no difference besides the next line the npc says. I even tried to make a few npcs hate me but nothing happened. (And apparently I am now lovers with some girl even though all I did was use her boat.)  The Persuasion skill, having 10 whole ranks, only affects the chance for you to succeed in rare, often pointless dialogue options, that you could just pass by quicksaving/loading. There are also a couple milestones in it, but all they do is slightly lower the cost of bribes for crimes.  - Equipment.  Many people say that upgrading your blacksmithing skill makes getting good gear too easy, but it seemed like the opposite for me. With max rank blacksmithing i only ever made a few items worth using since I could never find good materials , and ended up just selling all of my loot and purchasing better gear from shops.  Armor sets just stink. I have done a lot of exploring and looting but have never found more than 2 parts of a set besides when given to me. And even if I had, my gear would still be far better. Same story for most of the special weapons I get.  - Side quests are annoying.  There are a few I have done that I found interesting and enjoyable, but mostly it just became a case of skipping through, accepting everything, just doing them as I went to an area with an objective there.  This could also just be because I have played too many mmoprgs.  - Not enough variety in enemies.  Throughout the game you will be finding the same enemies even in far different settings, such as trolls, spiders, and pretty much any people. Even being in different reigons and factions, they will have the same attacks and skills.  - Plenty of annoying bugs and things that could do with improvement.  I have had quests break multiple times, even once before causing me to have to start a whole new game.  When you disable an enemy in reckoning mode, your character will still try to target them.  And many more little issues...",1,0

You know a game is doing something right when after 15 years millions of people are still playing it. Getting old sucks though and the only things dating it are of course it's visuals and zoomed in FOV if you aren't the sort of player used to using the 4:3 aspect ratio.,0,1
"I have to say, I really wanted to like this game. I was under the impression that Reckoning was a 'sleeper' of sorts, even though I'm not a big fan of stylized graphics. While I started out feeling somewhat good about the game, it didn't take long to notice the lack of palpable, gut-sticking depth. When it came time to sit down and pick my poison for the night I had no desire to play this game.  Pros: Fun combat controls, excellent environs, plenty to do, quite a number of crafting options, solid animations, mostly polished, mix-matching of the 3 class types (warrior, rogue, wizard).  Cons: The stories/adventures/crafting lack a special something (heart?), no jumping/climbing, beautiful areas are often just for 'looks' and cannot be explored, small areas where the game just wasn't fleshed out (like reading books, managing inventory, and skill trees).  If you're looking for a light romp though a fantasy world and you're less concerned about depth and more interested in a relatively fun combat system and plenty of run-around, this is likely a good enough choice for you. If you're on the other side of the fence and you prefer options, a little more freedom, and a world to sink your teeth into you'll not find it here.",1,0

"This game STILL continue to live on, but why was that? Well it was quite due to that fact that CS:Source isn't that much like by the pros since 2004 as CS:S as quoted: 'Too easy' and such, so the match for cs 1.6 grew more and more and that it was so hyped and praised and good, it still have matches even after 10 years of its 1.6 release (2003 - 2013) in which just kind of died out for CS:GO, but still, because of it's core gameplay and the fact that the commuity has been long just playing this multiplayer long and long and long, it is a game that will take long to die out, since it has a strong community base for it.  Since this game has been, well for long, then you should commonly see the use of wallhacking, cheats, aimbot, fake servers been used today, and the fact that there are quite a lot of empty servers now, but there are populated servers that are good and good community, but there are part of the community been off ever since.  It is seem a bit late to just buy and play this game, but it is still great to check it out if you are new to the cs series, or otherwise if you don't have GNU/Linux (In which I have), then you can buy Counter Strike : Globle Offensive anyway, since it is newer and (I think) has more players and pros playing it now. But if you want to have this raw action, then cs 1.6/cz would be great, you can get the bundle too if you want source as well, but source is fun to play as well.

"If you like shooting the bad guys then this is one of the games for you. When Counter-Strike was originally released in 2000, I didn't play it because I was like 1 year old. I play it now because of the fast/slow paced actions and the guns. There are a bunch of guns in Counter-Strike that you can use. There are little guns that are cheap, and big guns that are expensive. But here lies the problem with Counter-Strike... people don't even use all of the guns! Whenever I find onto a server, all of the players are only using the black gun, the brown gun, the silver gun, and the green gun. Even though there is a bunch of weapons, they aren't really all used much of the time. In the end, I play Counter-Strike because my computer is afraid of Counter-Strike: Source.",0,1

"First at 8 years, since in 2007, A friend comed at my house and installed me a cracked version of Counter - Strike 1.6 . Well I played it like one thousand hours , my friend moved in other country, and when I was playing someone destroyed my CS. I didn't know how to install it again, so i watched on youtube ,I reinstalled it again, That story with the destroy repeats like 2-3 times. I started to be an admin at 10 years, yes 10 years baby, I was doing requests to be an admin and i was telling them i was from 15 to 25 :D Well servers that i was an admin closed , get to the next one , when this closed , to the next one and like that. I always knew that servers close because there is a lot of money to pay to have one. At 12 years i discovered Steam. The first year I did't have any friend on steam because i Haved a ♥♥♥♥ laptop and i was not able to play call of duty 1 on 30 fps. I continued to be an admin on servers. 1 year ago I discovered an server that I love, I have some great owners that are very nice, and some day the owners decided that the admins need to buy Counter-Strike 1.6 . I don't planned to buy Cs 1.6 on steam because i already have it cracked , but i loved the server so much that i buyed it on steam! I think that i have like 5000 hours of play with cracked CS's :)  I totally recommend this game! 11/10  Love CS 1.6! &lt;3",0,1

"I don't do the MP, so this is all about the SP. I put about 160 hours into this game on PC, completed all the missions multiple times on the highest difficulty, and have almost all the achievements. If I can do that, then better players like you will do great for sure. Overall, the game was not a waste of money, but it is sad to see a great franchise focus on the features I like least. I haven't bought a COD game since this one and based on watching other people play them, I am glad I didn't. If you want the best COD experience, COD4 or COD2 will serve you well. Never played COD3 since I don't own an Xbox or whatever console that was exclusive to.   If you liked COD: Modern Warfare, this game will appeal because it is pretty much the same game with lots of minor changes. It expands on the trends that set COD4 apart from the original WW2 shooters that COD was built on, expanding the special operations focus and focusing on bond-style villains weaving fancy plots to run the world in some way.   Technology also is greatly emphasized; COD4 was built on real weapons in wide use in the early 21st-century, while COD: MW2 makes commonplace what is rare or simply theorized even today. Most guns now have electronic sights instead of ironsights, automated weapon systems like sentry guns play a prominent role, and remarkably efficient UAVs with more firepower than a B52 menace the skies. If you want a more sci-fi than real-world experience of 'modern warfare' then you have found your game. Incidentally, the poor RPG7 rocketlauncher remains a big part of the battlefield and remains unable to hit anything more than 30 feet away without a huge dose of luck. So much for modernity!   If you like the classic 'common soldier fighting for his country' theme of the original COD series, you will be in for some, but not complete, disappointment.There are maps where average soldiers still fight average soldiers from other countries, but where they are fighting often requires considerable suspension of disbelief. What is clear is that COD: MW2 is continuing the trend of the franchise towards special ops missions where the real story revolves around elite special forces units who battle sinister evil geniuses weaving great conspiracies. Common soldiers like Paratrooper Martin and Sergeant Moody are very much passe. If you want Splintercell without the stealth mechanics, this will do something for you.   Like COD4, maps are tight enough to keep players from getting too lost and open enough, most of the time, to let players do more than simply charge straight into killzones. Some maps have tedious bottlenecks that will frustrate, so expect a few ragequits unless you are a masochist like me. So far, the grenade spam problem that makes many COD games very annoying is not too strong here; certainly not as bad as COD: World At War. You will have time to rest between rushes without too much fear of an endless rain of grenades appearing out of nowhere to punish you for your laziness. Infinite respawns are pretty reasonable in this game as well, so you aren't always going to lose for not having rushed after that last enemy getting shot.   One huge feature that greatly limits the appeal of this game for me: NO PC CONSOLE! COD consoles have always been fairly limited in their utility compared to games like Halflife, but for reasons that make no sense to me, IW has decided that players don't need consoles and so now players have no ablity to fine-tune their game settings, use cheats, or even fix some issues that could have been done in the past with five seconds of typing. This massively reduces the playability of the game for me. Before this game, I loved to see the beautiful animations and graphics in slow-motion. Can't do that here and that makes me sad.  ",1,0

"Counter-Strike is only available to play in multiplayer; no bots. So you're forced to connect to someone else's server and put up with randomness and repetitive maps. And of course, it's the GoldSource Engine and all that entails.  Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is considerably more fun, in my opinion. You get all the same weapons, but there's a pseudo-story mode, AI bots to play with, and different objectives and a variety of maps you hop around, all of them challenging you in new ways. Kind of like the current campaign contracts in Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2.  Get this game (package), especially if it's on sale. If not for the classic-ness (or nostalgia), then get it for the great single-player experience with Condition Zero.",0,1

"I used to play this a few years ago and this was a game worth playing. The campaign mode was good, the multiplayer mode was decent and it ran smoothly. I have started playing once more for the past three months and I will admit. I have had enough! The campaign may still be good (although it runs a little slower for me now) but the worst thing about this game is the darn multiplayer.  Allow me to tell you why for this one very good reason in my humble opinion:  It has been hacked to oblivion- I click to play TDM in the game mode selection menu, I wait to be connected to what appears to be a TDM and I somehow land up playing Domination. What makes things worse is that the host can reset the match at the end without allowing you to change up your classes in the after match intervals. This means you go straight back into to domination ON A TDM SERVER CHOICE. This, added with lightning fast quick scopes, grenade launcher addicts, bunny hoppers (people whom jump and shoot/ avoid fire), spawn campers (sitting near enemy respawning places to get easy kills) and the aimbots makes for a very unpleasent gaming experience.   While Treyarch/Activision and ect will have likely to have been furiously working away to conjure a new way to make the public £100 poorer with a sequal to a previous title, they have been forgetting to make sure that their older releases are still being maintained for the enjoyment of hardcore loyalists to the older games that were released. No anti-hack updates or PunkBuster equivilent software has been created to stave away the hackers which suck the joy out of everything.  This may be irrelevant now as no one will be buying this or caring anymore. However I hope the developers are aware that yes, there are still people who play the older games and unfortunately people sad enough to hack them also (probably because they are better than the recent ones i.e Ghosts and Advanced Warfare in my opinion are enormous piles of rubbish trying to keep up with Halo). Getting back to this game, I would not recommend it because of how frustratingly terrible the game has become to even attempt to play. If you want to be hounded by the feinds listed above then go for it, but not for me as I have had my fill and so with that I conclude by saying: consider yourselves warned.",1,0

"Take on the role of Alex Mercer, a man who has no recollection of what’s happened to him or why, or how he came to acquire the shape-shifting powers he now possesses. Find the people who’ve done that to you and make them pay. The game -action, adventure, open worldish- sounded fun and looked fun, and I was very hyped to play it. I was also very disappointed when I finally did. Controls, though a bit wonky, are not difficult. You can change your body “at will” to attack enemies and destroy things, and when I say “at will” I mean you only have so many things you can change into. I think the most fun aspect of the game is the fact that you can ‘consume’ random people and then turn into them, and run/jump your way around pretty freely.   I’d say the graphics are dated, but it’s an oldish game, so it gets a slight pass for that. What it doesn’t get a pass for, however, is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance. For a 2009 game that should run like a charm on my computer, it sure worked like crap even at the lowest settings, lagging worse than Assassin’s Creed III - and at least that one had a reason to lag (no “low” video settings, hey). I’m also not particularly fond of the reddish/orangeish filter they use on later cinematics and gameplay time, I find it bothersome to look at.   Your character is overpowered, which is not bad in itself if you like an easy game, but it does make things boring after a while as it’s all the same; to tell the truth, it reminded me a little of God Hand for some reason, only that one was actually fun to keep playing. With Prototype, I did the first few missions and was bored out of my mind - that along with the slightly eye-hurting graphics and slight, random spikes of lag made the game truly disappointing.  The gameplay is pretty repetitive otherwise. Fight a bunch of bad guys, have them call in tanks and an airstrike, be chased, shake them off, rinse and repeat with a moderate variety of enemies and mutants to fight against.   It’s not a completely unplayable game, mind you. If you’re extremely bored and want to play something that doesn’t pose a huge challenge, it’s not a bad game and could even be considered entertaining. I liked the city, the chance to explore it some, the general idea of the game was good (though the story was a bit hit and miss with me), but the execution left a lot to be desired.  Perhaps if the game had lagged a bit less I would have enjoyed it a bit better.  I wouldn’t recommend this game, but I would certainly not tell you to steer clear from it either, as I feel it could be a lot more fun if you can actually play it sans the lag.",1,0

"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.' Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway",1,0
"I had difficulty getting into this, especially after having playing Orcs Must Die 2 co-op with a friend. Many of the levels, it seems, require you to run back and forth between two different entrances. In co-op this works marvelously (10 of the original maps can be played in the second title in the series), as each player can hold an entrance, calling the other when things get hairy. The number of weapons and traps is also less than the second game. Perhaps this is an unfair criticism, but at the very least, perhaps this review will be helpful to others who are tempted to visit the first game after trying the sequel.",1,0

"Gather 'round, kiddies, uncle Nax is going to take you back in time! From the throbbing peal of EA's branding to the steely sparkle trailing around the logo, Kingdoms of Amalur wastes no time in dating itself. By the time the game boots, you'll feel like you've jumped straight back into the golden days of 2006 as EA prompts you to create some account with them in glorious 1024x768 default resolution. You'll navigate treacherous options menus the likes of which have never even heard the words 'PC Port' before. You'll set the game difficulty to 'hard' and wonder if it makes a lick of a difference as you sleep through the tutorial. Your screen will whizz around in every direction at the barest nudging of the mouse!  -cue gory introduction cutscene to earn your M ESRB rating-  Behold! Graphics as 2004 intended them to- err, hold on a sec. Graphics as 2012 intended them to look! Your eyes will water and gleam with delight as upon your screen plays out visuals the likes of which early World of Warcraft could only aspire to possess (and probably achieved by Burning Crusade, I don't know, uncle Nax never got hooked on that WoW stuff, no siree). Your soft, gooey, colorful character springs out of a mound of corpses like some necrotic phoenix, ready to bop, slash, level, traverse custcene wheels (thanks, Mass Effect), and slog through menus as the RPG gods intended. Your Oblivion-playing friends are gonna be so jealous!  From simply turning your camera to navigating your inventory (and I get the feeling you'll be doing both of these things a lot), everything is designed with a controller in mind. Wanna grab that loot on the ground? F to interact, but left click 'take all' or no dice. Pop open your inventory with the I key, then click around to get to your gear submenus. Wanna don that sword? Better left click then push enter, or right click and choose 'equip.' Just clicking stuff won't do, that's too complicated!   Walk with me now, back, back. We'll step into an era with invisible walls and tight corridors, to keep the player engaged and never you mind that wooden slope that clips into the rocks and which is inexplicably uncrossable. You'll pull a lever which dumps a corpse into an incinerator, which will then thump endlessly in there until you walk away. Why's it there? Immersion! Will you see something like this again? Nope!  Walk with me, walk further back. Further back? Yes, brave reader, we're braving the nineties and before! From the first few glimpses of action, we are beset by features etched far into the history of games and television alike!  Stock sounds!  Marvel, as the giant rats you encounter make -that one pig squealing sound- that you've heard a thousand times before! Behold, as the magic IEDs the immortal elves plant on some pillars explode with -that explosion sound- that you've heard from 1994 Doom's rocket launcher! Truly, we are living in the future.  We go any further back, and Uncle Naxza's gonna have to get unborn, so we'll stop here.  To put it simply, Amalur looks and acts dated from the word 'go.' It's an obvious, poorly-done PC port of a game made combining just about every generic RPG gameplay element of the past ten years, taking strong inspiration from modern MMOs and Bethesda titles. Areas are linear (even after you get out of the tutorial location) and lack any immediate distinction. You are pretty much 'the chosen one' living out your power fantasy of ripping up bandits and glorks and whatever else as you walk from idle NPC to idle NPC, waiting with punctuation marks above their heads for some brave hero to solve whatever ailment. The enemy AI is trifling (take four guys that stare at you and bob around while one of them winds up an attack, or bum rush the guy ahead of you while he makes threatening gestures for eight seconds), which makes even 'hard' difficulty feel like 'laughable' difficulty if you've ever played an RPG before.   And then there's the stock sounds. Call me a stickler for soundwork (and the music seems okay, if you excuse the predictably percussive battle drum music), but I lose faith in a title very quickly when it starts using stock sounds. I don't know, it's lazy. We've heard these sounds before, and if you're trying to make something new, or different, or stand out, using sounds that we've all heard before isn't the way to do it! I'm sure soundwork is expensive, and you don't need unique sounds for every facet of a game, but I don't know, maybe the sounds that don't feature in every cheap action flick/TV drama.  Harsh? Yeah. Premature? Maybe a little, I only have an hour and a half playtime at this point. First impression? Strongly made. Not good.  Buy the game? No. Buy the game on sale? Maybe if you're out of other RPGs to play (is that possible?) or you've never really played a third person RPG before.",1,0

"You are 14 years old, first time trying to play something multiplayer and online. You see this game, since you have a potatoe PC you start to play this game. Runs smoothly on 53 FPS, woow sounds are great, look an AK-47 but name CV-47 you play it you shoot, you get killed asking yourself how you didn't kill him cause you shot 27 bullets on that guy and he still is alive. You play it over and over, finally getting your first kill. (cause the enemy was coruching and looking the other way and you instantly kill him running 17 bullets spent) you get high hopes, I can play this game it is so easy. You get more kills, you get greedy you rush alone you get killed when you even thought about rushing by an AWP on mid. Ages pass, poeple pass, kills get comon. You start to play better, after 2 years you learn the recoils you learn the hidding spots, you know what is the enemy's next move. You practise your awp then. You play DM and DM only with an awp, your kills are slick, and your flicks are quick and accurate. Admin invites you to his clan. FIrst time you play this game with somenone for serious. You can't do anything cause you are not used to an opposite player to play smartly and you get owned, you don't do kills and your teammates question your skill. Couple more months pass you learn your duties as a teammate. You give info you cover you open. Clan gets closed down, you find another clan you are one of the best players. You play more switch clans for better ones. You get to LANs you get scared of the all expecations and so many eyes on you. You tilt and miss your shots, months pass, you get better, you become a man of steel and high nervous, 2000 hours pass you are finally a great player. 10 000 hours pass, you win LANs you play against better players, you try a gainst payed players you are toe-to-toe with them but you loose cause your team isn't on that level and they get scared. 20 000 hours pass game is dying and so is your love for this game. But no one can pay thoose voice chats from 8 P.M till 6 A.M every weekend with your friends. So much hours in this game and you acomplished nothing. You play against your local teams you get banned cause they don't expect somene to play that good without cheats and you stop playing this cause cheaters take over, very 12 year old first downloads a cheat then this game. You get mentally tortured cause the kid is telling you how bad you are and that you suck, you cry inside. Thinking what happened to me, how come this kid plays better then me, then you figure out the cheats are great, but you still play it fairly. You cry cause no one cares for e-sports in your country and no one wants to pay you for playing games. Your parents tell you you don't have a life you loose some friends, you loose your girlfriend you stop being active in sports. YOu just play this game hoping to be recognised, but you don't so to help everyone in this world after 30 000 hours on this game, don't play it it is a sinking ship and it is pulling you down. Tears are in my eyes for all the time I was good but now you can't play a normal match since cheaters will destory you... run READER, move away, press back and never turn back on this game..",1,0

"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",0,1

"In 2007, CoD:MW (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare) was released into a community that has a seemingly insatiable lust for more shooter action. They weren't just given another shooter, they were given a game that really pushed the genre considerably. Amazing single player campaign and adrenaline-pumped, fast-paced multiplayer action with perks and weapon sets set the new standard on how these FPS's are done. It left it's mark on gaming as a whole, so a sequel was inevitable and gamers couldn't wait. In fact - according to an eye-witness who works at my local Game Stop - MW2 '...became the best-selling game in history before it was even released', all being pre-orders (of course, #1 sellers are subject to change). Imagine their dissapointment when they got this...  Plot 1/10  ..was so convoluted, I can't tell you what it was. Everybody wants everybody dead except the protagonists, and the only solution is...killing everybody. It's a movie written by Michael Bay. That's all I have to say about the plot without spoiling it. If you don't care (which you shouldn't), highlight this big, black box.    You meet Soap in the third-person, but it's so akward and out of his character to hear him talk. Then when you get back to playing as him, he stops talking again. For the main character of the first game being linked into the second game, he's just so seemed; so tacked-on and uninteresting. All the characters from the last game are 'magically' back too, despite being shot in the back of the head with Desert Eagles. Captain Price is back, but his acting and dialogue couldn't be more out of character. He went from rough, clever, and a cold sense of humor, to this...My Little Pony....thing. He's overly polite with no backbone. Imagine Mufasa suddenly with the mentality of Patrick Star, and you're not far off. Further, everytime I hopped onto an escape vehicle, I knew someone was going to shoot me because it happens like 4 times. When General Shepard reveals himself as the bad guy, it wasn't exciting. It was met with a loud YAAAWN. The twist is where the game's story slips into a void like a balloon into a hurricane. The player also 'dies' too much. Not in gameplay, but more like a scripted event/cutscene thing. Once again, *yawn*. The only intriguing part is when the EMP wipes out most of America's power. You and your team navigate a deathly-silent ghost town. It's eerie and very realistic; the best part of the game.    The ending also plays out like every other cutscene in the game: 'Good job, now let's carry you off and tell you who the kill nex-' CREDITS; THAR'LL BE A SEEQUEL!  Graphics/Sound 8/10  I'll put these in the same category because I don't have much to say about them. MW2's sound and visuals are everything we expect from the series: excellent. The guns, the dust, the lighting, character models are all beautiful, and guns, tanks, explosions all sound great, too; so why an 8/10? Attentive gamers will notice that a majority of this game's voice cast is from Mass Effect. In fact, several things were just 'taken' from Mass Effect. For one thing, your CO's voice is the voice of Captain Anderson, and the voice of the general is the voice of Admiral Hackett. Oh, and the general's name? Sheperd. There's nothing wrong with being inspired, but I call this a lazy, rip off. Infinity Ward wasn't even trying. Maybe I'm just being picky, but this really rubbed me wrong despite Keith David's long career as voice actor for military-esque media.  Gameplay 5/10  Finally, gamers are starting to see the light with the release of CoD:Ghosts. It's the same. Darn. Game. Same rail-shooter scenes, same set pieces, same 'set bomb and run away' scene, same door breaching scene, same, same, same. We've been playing the same game since the original Call of Duty in 2003 and before that with the Medal of Honor series. It's been 11 years of the same game. It's time for CoD to die. You run forward, you kill the next thing that moves, and steadily march to the credit roll. Everything about it is so banal; boring to the point of painful. The graphics and sounds aren't enough to mask the bad gameplay and story. A pretty package doesn't make the bad contents good. You've played CoD before. Enough said.  Multiplayer also went downhill with unbalanced weapons and killstreak abilities that broke the game entirely. When you get 3 kills in one life, you get a UAV that reveals all enemies on the radar. However, these streak rewards stacked with one another, so you use the UAV to get a few more kills, and get a chopper. The chopper automatically gets you 5 more kills giving you an AC-130 gunship. Use THAT for a few more kills, you get a nuke that ends the game instantly. Sounds pretty ambitious on pen and paper, but in game it means: first to a 3 kill streak WINS. Hackers also had their way with the game and Infinity Ward/Treyarch/Activision or all three refused to do anything about it. I've heard rumors that the same hacks that worked on MW2 also worked on MW3 and Black Ops. Watching this trend, I believe it.   If you want an example of customer service done RIGHT, let's ask Valve. Some time ago, Steam was glitching up and improperly banning players from accessing MW2. Gabe Newell wrote a personal apology to these gamers, and offered them a free copy of Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2). While that was generous and very polite, that might have been a bad idea for the poor people that play L4D2, because all the teenage @***holes from this game are now trolling the L4D2 community (as if that game wasn't bad enough.)  The Verdict  Visually, there's little to complain about. MW2 is very realistic by sight and by sound. Some of the settings are creepy with ash blotting out the sun and smoke rising from decimated vehicles and climbing corpses to escape combat. The whole world is going crazy, but they couldn't make the player care less. Traversing the beautiful world is an uphill hike to the credits. Yearly releases also means the community will be widely divided and chopped thinner and thinner with each release, so there's no point in trying to play MP. MW2 is big pass. Maybe get it for 5 bucks and beat it once. Final score: 3/10 Almost no reason to buy it.",1,0

"This game has problems, but it’s one of the best ones you’ll ever play. I have so many memories with this game on an Xbox, so I decided to get it here while it was on special. The game started on the first try, but it’s a hassle to find a legit multiplayer game. Zombies are fun as always, but you will not find a lot of multiplayer games so get yourself some friends or play it solo.   Pros: Mods Amazing Campaign Multiplayer Zombies  Cons:  Does not save my online multiplayer progress, so I’m always starting from private Random crashes Not much zombie’s servers Multiplayer is full with modded maps and some hard to find legit ones Bluescreens on my PC  Game will sometimes not even open and stay in a black screen  You’ll waste way more time trying to fix all of these problems than actually playing, so get ready to read some 7 year old forms and going to some outdated websites no one ever goes to anymore.  This is an awesome game, but its way too complicated on a PC. I’ll rather play it on a console to just keep it sweet and simple. ",1,0

"Kingdoms of Amalur begins with an appealing, even charming veneer that quickly and dramatically tarnishes. At its best, it's a generic, 'safe' fantasy game more reminisicent of an MMO than a single player WRPG.  -------------------------------------------  Combat is broken down into the typical RPG trio of Warrior (Might), Rogue (Finesses), and Mage (Sorcery), or a Jack of All Trades, with the option to respec whenever you want, as often as you want. From the beginning to the end, Sorcery goes from significantly stronger to hilariously overpowered, and the classes ultimately play the same, the only difference being in what particle effects you throw at the enemy.  The game plays more like an MMO than a traditional single player RPG. You drift from zone to zone, awaiting the inevitable explosion of yellow exclamation points, and there are indeed many. Too many, as a matter of fact. While one can argue that this adds more gampeplay time, it's more padding than lengthening. There's no substance to any of them, and they all play out essentially the same. A random loot system adds another serious deficit. Fighting your way to the bottom of an ancient ruin, behind a hidden door you may find a few mushrooms and a healing potion, while looting a random household rewards you with the ancient Deathaxe of MurderLord. It's worth noting that this randomization applies to the Blacksmithing system too, in which you salvage items for parts (Which are also completely randomzied. Epic weapons are as likely to give you worthless parts as junk weapons)to craft new ones. In theory you should be able to create weapons better than what you'd find, but you'll more likely than not find trash parts, and anything you do craft will be beaten by something you find on the side of the road.  There's little to say about the system itself. It's a very simple click-based, skill-hotbar system of combat. It's not functionally bad, it's just not very interesting, and lacks any sort of depth. The game's Inventory system has to be one of the worst i've ever seen. Although there are attempts to provide organization, they are token. You are unable to sort your list-based inventory, which seems to organize itself completely at random. Items sharing the same set name may be dozens of slots away from each other. Also of note is a serious problem with many, many quest items that never lose their flagging, leaving them trapped in your inventory for the entire game. As they still take up space, this can be a serious issue. By the end of the game, over 50 of the 110 items in my inventory were quest flagged and unremoveable.   In terms of art and sound direction, again they hit every switch to be as generic and forgettable as possible, cycling through the usual array of fantasy zones and unenergetic voice acting. The game is rife with bugs and glitches, some of which can be gamebreaking, and many of which will impact your gaming experience in other ways, such as the above mentioned Inventory issue.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- If I had to sum up Amalur in 5 words, I'd only need to give you two. 'Generic. Pass.'",1,0

"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",0,1

"I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that.",1,0
I would reccomend this game if it were possible to play multiplayer. But its not sadly.,1,0
5/10 Okay game in my opinion at the time. It did not do much to stand out with all the shooters that came out around the same time frame. For that it got 'average'. I prefer the realism and gameplay of Battlefield over this shooter. There are newer versions out there so I (if this was the only option for me) would skip this and get the newer CoD that has more 'realism' and overall better feel. Plus more people are playing online on the newer one and more players = better match making leading to a happier gamer :),1,0

"I had this game on the PlayStation3 and it was kinda enjoyable. Ripping and tearing apart innocent citizens and soldiers alike, destroying everything, ellbow-slamming a tank - there will be gore and explosions everywhere. Sounds decent, right?  A little.  Only problem is the controls where a bit clunky (even on the PS3) and I had massive problems focussing and attacking the enemy I actually wanted. Another funbreaker is the fact that you're easily being bounced back, even by small and weak enemies. It's even worse when stronger enemies and helicopters chase you. Sometimes you're feeling like a ball in a pinball machine.  This game has so much potential and with proper implementation this propably would have been the best anti-aggression-game and there is. I mean, you have all those amazing powers! From disguise to running at super speed to hammerfists (lets you smash tanks), clawhands (rips and tears everything apart), whiplash (for taking down distant enemies), superjumping, semi-flying (gliding). You can even throw buses into helicopters and stuff, the list goes on and it's awesome.  But you're almost not able to live it up.  The story is ok and acceptable. The missions are way too hard and not fun at all (I'm not a good gamer, though). In one mission you have to flee. Excuse me? I'm a godlike creature and can destroy a tank with a single blow with my ellbow, why the heck should I flee?  That's boring and uninspiring. It's like getting a Lamborghini in a racing game and the game tells you to drive not faster than 30 miles per hour. Unfortunately, I didn't find any cheats or mods for this game. I think with a little effort like removing all the time based missions and the bouncing this would be just awesome.  If you can get this game for a decent price (it's under 10 dollars mostly, on Humble Bundle even cheaper) and if you do like gore, GO GET IT and happy ripping and tearing bodies apart for a while. I really hope you could do an devastator attack on some people out there who are wasting so much potential. It hurts, especially as a creative person.",1,0

"'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.' A review by Richard Valkinsenn.  EDIT: My original review of Modern Warfare 2 has been updated to reflect my changed opinion of the game. I have a lot to say about it, and not a lot of it's good. The review is now broken up into two sections and will cover the game's campaign and multiplayer suites, respectively.  ---- CAMPAIGN REVIEW ----  Modern Warfare 2 is the pinnacle of the Call of Duty series, second only to it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. Unfortunately, factoring in both the game's single-player and multiplayer suites, that's not really saying much. Campaign-wise, admittedly, Modern Warfare 2's campaign does feature a thrilling, well-acted campaign, and comes packed with thrills and chills, the latter of which is mostly contained in the campaign's notorious 'No Russian' mission. While the campaign's level design is linear, thankfully the player is given a wide variety of roles throughout the game's runtime. One level will feature a tense series of firefights with loads of enemies while another will have the player moving stealthily in a semi-linear fashion from point A to point B. As for long-lasting appeal, somehow, Modern Warfare 2 has a charm that has withstood the test of time.  The campaign also features a co-op mode featuring missions based on scenarios seen not just in Modern Warfare 2 but also it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. These missions are widely varied and feature time attacks, stealth missions, and other various modes for up to two players to engage in. There are a few missions which require no less than two players, but thankfully, the majority of the missions can be completed solo, if players so desire.  Sadly, while the campaign and co-op modes are pretty solid, as far as a PC port goes, the entire package as a whole is found wanting. For starters, the game's options lack many essential PC features, like a Field of View (FOV) slider. In fact, it seems the developers went out of the way to make it difficult to even edit the native FOV via console or cfg edits. Not to mention the fact that the lack of separated audio sliders makes trying to tailor the game's audio experience to one's liking impossible. What makes it even worse is the lack of mod support, meaning basically that making custom content for the game is something that's just not gonna happen. Above all else, what makes it all even worse is the game's multiplayer suite, which only serves to highlight many of the game's glaring faults.  Campaign Verdict: I liked it.  ---- MULTIPLAYER REVIEW ----  Years ago, I played Modern Warfare 2 on Xbox LIVE and rather enjoyed it. However, having transitioned to the PC in the last several years and having played other, superior online titles, I've found Modern Warfare 2's PC multiplayer suite to be nothing short of a train wreck.  In addition to the glaring lack of an FOV slider, so much power and choice was taken out of the player's hands in this game. Dedicated servers, or at least a server browser for choosing matches is non-existent. Voting to kick or ban problematic players was left out. Mod support for custom content is gone. A much-needed feature like hiding the in-game chat log is just not there. And sure you could host a private match, but hosting a public match with custom rules and map rotations is a thing of the past. Well, unless you hack it in, but then you run the risk of getting hit with a Valve Anti-Cheat ban.  Then you get to the actual gameplay that Modern Warfare 2 has to offer... and it gets a little better and a lot worse from there. While MW2's maps are thankfully not as restrictive as later titles in the overall series, they still suffer from a near-complete lack of interactivity. Not everything about the maps is terrible, however, as they do allow for a multitude of different tactics and approaches, though this also applies to hiding spots and long, open stretches for campers to exploit. As far as the game's arsenal and perks go, there's a lot of room for mixing and matching to create a lot of different approaches and playstyles. At the same time, weapon customization is sadly hampered by the fact that only one attachment is allowed at a time, though a certain perk can allow up to two. However, adding this perk to a loadout means that no other perks in that perk's category can be applied.  Above all else, there's one thing that makes Modern Warfare 2 just about unbearable at any time, and it's an issue that also extends to the entire series, overall. A lot of the methods for getting kills in Modern Warfare 2 require little to no skill to employ. An example would be the addition of quick, one-hit knife kills that can be require little more than a button press, in addition to lethal traps that can be laid for other players. Several of the game's perks also exacerbate this, like a perk that expands the lethal radius for explosives or another that increases the distance over which knife kills apply. Not to mention the fact that the game doesn't treat fired shots like projectiles; once the sights are lined up, bullet hits are instantly guaranteed, no matter the distance.  Overall, while it has many high points, Modern Warfare 2 on the PC leaves way too much to be desired. A glaring lack of much-needed PC features along with an array of lackluster gameplay features sours an online and even offline experience with lots of untapped potential.  Multiplayer Verdict: It could've been much better.",1,0

"It's the year 2015. This game was made in 2000. 15 years is alot in terms of technological advnaces. You only need to look at the break throughs, inventions and so on to know this. So i'm bought back to my original question why do so many people,play thos game now, the graphocs look terroble as they would seeing as it was 15 years ago and so on. I would assume becaise it is because of how succesful amd popular the counter strike franchise is. But they mechanics, movement,graphocs and many more wouldn't be good in today's 2015 gaming standards. Do u just play it to try amd revive the good old times or to simply run away from children?",0,1
"The first game that struck down like lightning, stole our souls and maked us fight with parents to make them understand that you can't PAUSE an ONLINE game.

I would like to see the lazy youths of today arrange a LAN where everyone had to carry a large 19inch CRT monitor with them :)  All the drunken insanity of 20youths in a basement-LAN (NO INTERNET!), killing eachother and sharing files on DC++.

"Okay let me first start off with saying this... This game is NOT worth $20!!!!!!! If you're really wanting to get this game, please do yourself a favor &amp; wait until Steam puts it up for sale. May be a while down the road, but I imagine they will eventually.  Having played this game for several hours, I have gotten into several modded servers. Granted, getting into a normal server was as easy as backing out &amp; searching again, but the thing is, this game sees like 600-800 players MAX on a good day. So you're not always going to be able to back out &amp; get into a normal server. You will sometimes back out &amp; then just rejoin the same modded server.  The negative aspect out of the way, this is still the same old MW2 you played years ago. It plays just the same &amp; when you DO get into a noraml server, it's loads of fun! I've never had any issues getting into full servers either, so it's got that going for it.   As far as hackers &amp; modders goes, I have never personally came across one, or if I did, I didn't notice. It's just the modded servers you have to watch out for. Play on those to long &amp; you could get slapped with a VAC Ban!  All in all this is a good game, but i really wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than die hard MW2 fans, or people trying to complete their CoD collection. It's a dying game! Yes it will ALWAYS have a player base, (mainly the hardcore MW2 fans) but if you're just getting into PC gaming, or looking for a new FPS, I would tell you to buy Call of Duty 4 instead. There are 4,000+ ACTIVE servers in that game &amp; the number of active players grow every day!",1,0

"Awsome like COD online but a lot better. This one is actuly updated and 100% freeer. (edit) Its slipped a lot since then, its overdone the p2w thing, and the overall game quality has slipped. no longer reccomending, not worth the download anymore. Though if you download for the tf2 knife its worth trying to see if you like it for a short period but dont waste long on it and also i suspect they have powered down the servers as the game is generally more laggy and slower, also when aeria took over instead of fixing a glitch they just closed the map as it was a co-op level and the glitch allowed people to get an item as a f2p player that they intended only p2p players to be able to get, thats the ethos aeria has money. The game overall now feels (the europe+usa version at least) that it is only still running to squeeze the remaining money out of the remaining core players.  ALSO SOME ADVICE: If you have ever installed this game then uninstalled and have no intent of playing again or playing another game that uses game guard, the games anti-cheat engine, which is ironically a minor security threat dosent uninstall, if a hacker tried to get into your pc they could make it a threat so i would advise googling how to propery uninstall gameguard. While you have the game installed this is not a problem because it will update, but once the game is uninstalled it will not update if new security risks emerge so could become a problem.  Edit, ava has recently been acuired by a new company that bought areia, will see if anything changes and update this review if any significant changes come to my attention. (edit) Nope.",1,0

"DON'T FALL FOR NOSTALGIA BIAS  Pros: -classic feel  -people still play it(barely) -no skins(almost)  Cons: -80% of the players are hackers and do not speak english(so no real teamwork) -real servers with the gamemode actually being a CS type are almost non-existant -actual enjoyability comes from whether or not you like to deal with the above  This is one of gamings most treasered games and it is sad to see it get like this. Nostalgia can only get people so far and it is a shame thaat few people explain the reality of this game in their reviews. The fun is not totally gone, although it is something you have to really try to find. The gameplay is as you would expect it (at least when you find a server that doesn't have CSGO surfers on it), nothing has changed and thats good. The problem is the community. It is hard to find a server with a team you can communicate with because of the major language barrier the game now has.  Communication is key in this game as you would expect, and it is very rare because almost everytime you get on a server it is from a central american area and the players mostly speak spanish. Making it difficult as you would expect.   The amount of hacking in this game shameful, it is more common than it is in CSGO and is a real problem that makes the experience more bad than it already has become.  The server types are just like what you would see in an old game, modded to hell with new terribly unenjoyable game modes. If you were to see you would find many gameplay modded servers that give you trash that nobody wants to see (surfing).   Take away the nostalgia bias that everyone tosses out and you will see that this game is a former shell of itself. It has all the elements of a typical old PC game that only a few people will try hard enough to enjoy. The enjoyment can still be found, but at a heavy heavy cost. RIP CS1.",1,0

"A perfect example of a game that looked so good on paper but was executed so badly it was exiled to a corner and no one wants to mention it today. All in all KoA: Reckoning is a solid RPG, it has a huge world with tons of NPC's and quests, it has rich lore behind the world that, most of the time, makes sense, and the game introduces things like the lorestones and Reckoning Mode to spice things up both on the RP side and the Action side.  Unfortunately pretty much every aspect of this game falls flat. The talent system is pretty redundant and mostly serve to give you passive bonuses you can fit your playstyle around (!), as any true RPG blacksmithing and enchanting is as overpowered as a Predator and the dialog is sometimes so bad that you wish you bought the game on a CD-disc just so you could throw it out the window.  All in all, if you're looking for the next Icewind Dale, Masquerade: Bloodlines or Dark Souls, this is not it.

"First off, don't get fooled by my played hours, I've been playing it way before it was avaiable on steam but I didn't touch it since around 1.5 years. I would estimate that my played hours are somewhere around 3k, I've also participated in 2 tournaments. I would still love this game and recommend it to everyone and their grandma if Aeria wouldn't have messed up AVA like they did.  AVA was a great game back when ijji published it, it had great potential. The maps are great, nothing to complain about here. You could buy Weapons, Grenades and Armor for ingame money. You would get money relatively slow, but once you hit 50-60k € you could buy a decent, permanent weapon and that's pretty much all you needed. You also need money to repair that weapon and buy parts for your weapon that need to get replaced regularly. Getting 50-60k could take up to 1-2 months, depending on how much you played. You could still spend real money on weapons in order to get them immediately. It still was not pay to win at all. The graphics were actually decent for a F2P game. You would encounter hackers from time to time, depending on whether there were any free hacks out there or not.  Ever since Aeria games took over things changed. Their biggest failure was the removal of permanent weapons, which ultimately made the game pay to win. You could only buy weapons for 30 days, then they expired. The price of a decent weapon was still around 50-60k, and I guess you already see that this is a huge problem. If you don't play 3-4 hours per day you won't be able to get 50-60k per month, that means you have to play with the standard weapons which are not entirely useless, but you would never beat someone who is on the same skill level as you with a standard weapon while he uses his expensive rifle. This also meant that old players will always have an advantage over new players, because they still have their permanent weapons.   The thing is, you may think that the publisher should have no influence on the content of the game, since they are only publishing, but not making it. Redduck is actually making the game, and they do so for several other regions such as Japan/China/Korea. All of those regions still have permanent weapons. In fact, Aeria denied to have anything to do with the change from permanent to timed weapons, but we actually contacted someone from Redduck who told us that they were against that change, but Aeria insisted.  The next point are hackers. Aeria implemented a new anti cheat engine that doesn't do its job at all. There were times where you would run into a hacker every 2-3 games. I can't tell you how it is in its current state tho, since I haven't played since quite some time.  By the way, Aeria introduced the 'Tiered Spender' where you would get additional rewards depending on how much money you spend on their game. That's a nice concept, but the thing is that many of those additional rewards are permanent weapons, which is another aspect that makes it pay to win. Just to give you an idea on what you have to spend for a permanent weapon: In one of those tiered spenders you would get a permanent weapon starting at 7999 AP(a little more than 60€) and ending at 29999 AP(around 210€).  This is coming from someone who sometimes played this game all day long, played 2 tournaments and even made a few videos, my best montage got around 2k views, my overall best AVA video has around 10k views. If you have LOTS of money and can live with the fact that this game is pay to win then by all means, get it. I've been putting a decent amount of money into this game myself, and I would never do it again. Money still doesn't buy you skill, but it surely gives you an huge advantage. The next thing to consider are the hackers, everytime there are free hacks on a certain site AVA will be unplayable, and you might even get banned despite being a legitimate player (At one point hackers were able to use your name, which earned you lots of reports). And then I wish you good luck with Aerias automated support answers when you try to appeal a ban.  In the end it's up to you, but I can not recommend it in its current state.   *UPDATE*  I still play a round or two every few months, and I was positively surprised when I played yesterday. Permanent guns are back, but they are really expensive and it surely will take you quite some time until you have enough money for a good gun. I think they need to either make the weapons cheaper, or give you the option to try them out for free before you buy them permanently. It now feels a lot like back in the days when I still used to play this game all day long, but it still has a few pay to win elements. You are still not going to be able to beat a good player if you are average and spend a lot of money, but it's harder for beginners to get into the game, because it will take lots of time until you found the right gun, can afford it, and got enough money to buy armor as well. So it's not pay to win in the sense that bad players will defeat good players because they spent money, but good players who already have an advantage over new/bad players will have an even bigger advantage, so expect to have a hard time in the beginning if you plan on playing AVA.   If you are starting out I recommend you check out some guides because there are some things you should know that are not immediately obvious. Here is an (old) thread that's actually meant for players who want to play AVA competitively, but still is relevant and could give you some useful tips:  http://www.aeriagames.com/forums/en/viewtopic.php?t=1885997   Hackers are still around, but it's not as bad as it used to be. It is understandable that they can't prevent hacking, because they can only react to hacks after they have been released for the most part. They surely are doing things to stop hackers before they actually get to do any damage, we have XIGNCODE after all. It's similar to bugs and glitches, if you programming a game or program you are going to try to avoid bugs, but you can't eliminate every single bug before they actually occured. The best you can do is try to prevent them to your best ability, so there will be as few bugs as possible.  So, I still don't recommend this game, altho it got a lot better. AVA is on a good path right now and maybe I will one day be able to recommend it again. I even think I'm going to play it more regularly from now on. Maybe I will give AVA a positive review one day, but today is not that day.",1,0

"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the main game we point the finger at when we look at the negative aspects of Call of Duty, and rightfully so. Before I delve deeper, I would like to start out by addressing the controversy between Call of Duty and Battlefield. While I do prefer Battlefield, I do NOT despise the COD franchise. I had moderate enjoyment with Call of Duty 4, and a blast with Black Ops 2. However, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is easily my least favorite in the franchise. Without further ado, lets dive in.  What does Modern Warfare 2 do wrong? The first place is the campaign. While the story was decent in the game, it was a big disapointment. To no suprise, it is a linear corridoor shooter, as you mow up enemies and stop evil Russian men. Nothing new here, and there is no motivation to play the campaign. The only REAL motive I can think of is if you took alot of enjoyment in COD 4 campaign, and want to see what happens to your favorite characters in the franchise.   Next we have Spec Ops, which is a spectacular addition to the game. The minigames are superb in this game with great level design, and is a blast with friends. I took alot of enjoyment holding off enemies, mostly due to the replayabilty and freedom of this gamemode, in contrast to the Campaign, which forces you to put rockets on certain targets.   Finally we have the multiplayer, the heart and soul of the game. And let me tell you, is it horrid. This is not because the game is not 'realistic' enough - come on, we are in an arcade shooter. It is because mechanics are bad. Yes, they gel well, and the game doesn't feel clunky, but they are just flat out bad design choices. The first issue is create-a-class, which looks very dynamic at first, but essentially boils down to a handful of gun and attachment combos that are overpowered. This makes gunplay boil down not to skill, reaction time, or map knowledge - but who has the best overpowered gun. Same goes for perks and deathstreaks. I would have much more enjoyment in making a class, and finding a setup that suits my playstyle, in contrast to this game.The game also has no emphasis on teamwork, mostly due in part to killstreaks that cater completely towards racking up more kills. Not to mention, hacking in this game is horrid - but that is a whole 'nother story within itself.   To conclude, Spec Ops is not worth purchasing this game. While it is fun while it lasts, you will be forced into multiplayer, which is terrible. The games' mechanics only allow a handful of good classes, and that is the only way to do well in the game. Combined with a lack of emphasis on teamwork, the game becomes a muddled mess more than a competitive arcade shooter. If you want the best experience possible, I would highly reccomend picking up Black Ops 2, which fixes many of the problems addressed above.  ",1,0

Under his breath, he murmurs:  'King Arthur would've played shortstop. King Arthur...King Arthur. Hrm.'

"This game was piece of art when it first came out, so many improvements from Call of Duty 4. The campaign for Modern Warfare 2 was an absolute masterpiece, you continue on from Call of Duty 4, playing as different branches, with different characters, though this game does have it's moments being a bit repetative later on in the game but something new always pops up to give you a boost of interest, the graphics for this game are amazing, huge step up from COD4, the AI is improved but still has it's moments where it is completely unintelligent and has no regard for itself, animations are great, many weapons throughout the campaign to choose from, the singplayer earns a 9/10. As for the multiplayer I cannot say the same, let me start off saying that Modern Warfare 2 is only worth playing for it's singeplayer due to the fact that the multiplayer is full of hackers all day everyday, and you can risk being deranked in a specific server, that goes with saying you can be at risk for a VAC ban for claims of cheating, the multiplayer is nice and all, lot's of intense fighting, however the hackers are the main reason why multiplayer is ruined for this, so I do not recommend this game for it's multiplayer.",1,0

"Ok, I admit, I played this game back in my childhood on my original Xbox, and had so much fun. Not too long ago I reinstalled it for my computer, but when I did, I HATED it. I couldn't play right. People would one tap me from the side of the map, others will just be an absolute pro with the AWP making life so hard. Theres no mercy for new players, there's no official Valve servers, only the community servers which take away the classic feel. I have probably only joined 2 servers that have none of the stupid annoying Quake sounds. No 'double kill' or 'dominating' just classic CS 1.6. It was aggrovating for me, my favourite childhood game gone to waste, or so I thought. I was just bad at the game. I was scared to do anything. If I pushed in first, I thought I would get destroyed immediately. The guns felt weird and ridiculously inaccurate, the game didn't FEEL right, and anything I tried would ultimately fail. Well, until a couple of weeks ago.   I played violent. I played smart. I played gruesome and unforgiving. Getting 4 man spray downs and one-double tap headshots across the map. I was ruthless, relentless, and I enjoyed it. This game was starting to be fun for me, not as annoying, not as frustrating, only fun, as I always wanted it to be. The thing is I learned not to be scared, the same with CSGO. I played CSGO, sucked at it, played horribly until I just began to not care if I died. That was when I began to play better. CS 1.6 came, and I began to be horrifying. Enemy teams would scream at me, I would laugh and continue, their unfornate moments was fuel to my wrath, until, of course as it always happens, a pro AWPer comes towards me and 420 swagscopes me in the face. Rage quit.  11/10 would get Blazed it again.",0,1

"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.",0,1

welcome to cod a game populated by lonely 40 year old men hoping to fufill their dreams of joining an army (you could join a militia at the age of 5 in my home land) the lonely 40 year olds playing this game can be very volatile because one time I was doing a joint co-op mission with these gay lords and suddenly they started screaming at me '2 IS DOWN' I was very confused because I have absolutely no clue who 2 is and why he is down so I decided that was enough and so I started screaming at them 'IS THERE A XBOX VERSION OF THIS?' whilst typing that I was guzzling a 4l bottle of mtn dew and also crunching on a 50kg bag of chilli heatwave doritos and came to the swift conclusion i'm not better than the people i'm offending.

" -----EDIT-------  A lot of people have been accusing me of cheating in MW2 Multiplayer lately. This is entirely false, I did not cheat whatsoever. At the time I was playing there were (and probably still are) A LOT of hacked lobbies. What happened to me was I logged into a modded game. After being in it for few seconds it disconnected me from it with a message saying ' Bad host '. So I was like ok but then I noticed that literally all of the stats were unlocked (Titles, Emblems, Weapons and their attachemnts, etc.), it also boosted me from being a lvl 30 or something noob to a lvl 70, allowing me to enter prestige mode. I didn't deal with that, just a bit worried. I looked up on some forum, found that people encountered the same problem and that you need to contact support as soon as possible otherwise it'll ban you. I didn't know at the time how to deal with it so I went with the flow, hoping nothing will happen to my account. Then after a few weaks I recieved a ban, saying ' Cheat detected '. I then tried to contact any support but people on the forum stated it's too late because Steam Support won't listen to people who got VAC banned.  ALSO NOTE:  I remembered that around the initial VAC ban my account was hijacked and couldn't retrieve it after a year when a Steam Support finally realized the issue. I assume that the hijacker went downloading the possible external software for the game and used it on it in order to get me banned. I remember that guy, go check him up, his name is 'solutioNNN' and also has a VAC ban from MW2. I am not lying about this, no I am not making this up, this is my honest review.  -------------------  Singleplayer: Wonderful! Special Ops: Wonderful, even co-op is great! Multiplayer: THE WORST, EVERY TIME YOU GO TO LOBBY, YOU COULD ENTER A HACKED ONE, RESULTING IN UNLOCKING EVERY WEAPON, WEAPON ATTACHMENT, EMBLEM, TITLE, ETC. THIS WILL RESULT IN A UNFAIR VAC BAN. I do not recommend this game simply because of this mess. I recommend you to pirate this game just to experience the wonderful storyline. Oh, and if you happen to buy it and find that your items are all unlocked, I suggest you contacting the Steam Support before   getting a possible permanent ban .",1,0

"For most intents and purposes, this game feels very much like a Skyrim clone. Regardless, it did keep me entertained for a few weeks. IF you haven't played Skyrim, I would recommend playing that instead. If you need an RPG and are bored of anything Bethesda has out, then buy this to keep yourself entertained until a better game comes along. If you do play this, be sure to make multiple save files, like maybe one an hour. I have encountered several bugs that were very close to game-breaking(the Amalur wiki usually explains workarounds). Personally, I would have preferred another Bethesda(Elder Scrolls, Fallout series), or Bioware(Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights) game, but this game made nice filler until the next Dragon Age gets released.",1,0

The graphics still are decent to this day (2016) and the music can get you in the mood as your shooting down soldiers. The only bad thing is this series rarely, if ever ges on sale. The price for what you get isn't worth it for single player coming in at little then five (5) hours. It's all preference. The mutlplayer component is there but filled with hackers. If you can get it on sale for 14.99 or less I say grab it. Otherwise, your not missing out on anything that has not been done in previous FPS.",1,0

"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the current iteration of Valve’s top-in-class competitive shooter, and the first to be maintained in the very modern way it has been. Learning from its experience with Team Fortress 2, Valve has a miniature economy in CS: GO that revolves entirely around gun decals. Players get a few ‘drops’ a week after matches, which can be a gun decal or a weapon crate – the latter of which cost £1.49 to unlock with a one-use key from the store. Obviously this economy is tailor-made, and so there are extraordinarily rare and mysteriously fantastic-looking gun and knife skins (with prices in the hundreds of pounds), then a large range of other skins tapering down to the common-as-muck variety that trades for pennies.  I don’t pay much attention to the CS: GO economy as a whole, though it’s interesting enough, but it’s important for a non-player to understand that a big chunk of the game’s audience takes it very seriously indeed. In the days after a new Operation launches countless forum threads are launched about the value of the new goods, whether someone should sell this new rare drop they got or hold it for a while, Twitch streams with giveaways and 50 crates being unlocked and so on. You get the picture.    I give such context on CS: GO’s economy because – even though it is a subsidiary part of the game to many including myself – it is the molten core of Operation Vanguard. CS: GO is a regularly-patched game but the major updates come in the form of Operations that introduce new maps and new skins, at the price of around £3 for an access pass – with the nice touch that maps are available to all players regardless, or made so shortly afterwards.  To give an exhaustive history of Operations would be no more useful than a general overview. If you play Counter-Strike then the chances are you play a lot of Counter-Strike. What the Operations do is freshen things up a bit – naturally they don’t disrupt the regular Dust-Mirage-Inferno cycle of competitive play, but you get some unfamiliar environments to tool about in, the chance to score some fancy new weapons, and in the context of a game you play almost daily, £3 a few times a year is chicken feed.  Operation Vanguard is different, and the changes are not for the better. The first problem I have with it is major: the way it’s sold seems to skirt the borderline of deception. To participate in Operation Breakout you bought an ‘All-Access Pass’ for £2.39. To participate in Operation Vanguard I bought an ‘Access Pass’ for £2.39. The difference is obvious side-by-side, but of course when OV popped up in Counter-Strike’s home menu I bought it more or less instantly, thinking this was the same thing.  OV’s selling point is two ‘campaigns,’ a series of missions with three branching paths. The missions are things like ‘Win 16 rounds on map X’ and ‘Kill 20 chickens in Deathmatch mode,’ and completing one bags a pre-determined award – either a weapon crate or a random weapon from a specified collection. So far, so OK. But in fact OV has two more campaigns, both of which cost £1.79 to access – which follow more or less the same pattern.    To be crystal-clear about this, the money is not the problem. I’m happy to pay for Operations, and OV’s combined total of around £6 in the context of the time I put into Counter-Strike is really not an issue. But that switch from ‘All-Access Pass’ to ‘Access Pass (with the right to buy more access)’, just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me right off.  First of all I felt conned. I bought the OV pass in the same way I’d bought all the previous Operation passes, expected it to be the same deal, and realised I’d been fooled by the removal of ‘All.’ Secondly, what the two ‘extra’ purchases offer is basically a re-skinned version of OV’s mission book. But thirdly, and this is the real killer, you’re encouraged to buy them to self-medicate the most egregious, enormous, climactically wrong and frankly offensive design decision in Vanguard.  There are multi-day cooldowns on missions. That’s right Rambo, you may have thought you were buying another set of missions and drops to liven up day-to-day business in CS: GO, but in fact Vanguard is a campaign designed to play out over a set period of time, with the only limiting factor a bald external one: cooldown timers.  Let me set the scene for you. I love Counter-Strike. I saw Vanguard was out on a Thursday, and cleared Friday night. Got in a few beers. Booted it up and bought the pass. I played the first mission, cleared it in about 15 minutes. Chose a second, the killing chickens one, and that was another 15 mins. So around half an hour into my evening of joy I was given a four-day cooldown for the next mission.    You can slice this any way you want, but it’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The sad thing is I get the thought process behind it. Consider: you’re Valve, in charge of a game where players (a) want new content but (b) put in so many hours that they’ll rush through anything almost instantly. For example, mission chains. Operation Breakout introduced missions in the form of random drops, which parcelled them out over time but had no larger arc. It was fine but the missions never felt… important. So Operation Vanguard’s missions are in structured patterns, with defined rewards, and are given the desired longevity through simple brute force of timing. You will not complete this content before we say so, because you can’t.  Oh, except that if you buy the extra mission packs, your cooldowns decrease across the board, because now you’re allowed to do more missions in a set period. That’s right. You’re basically paying to reduce cooldowns. In a Valve game.  The thing is that Operation Vanguard is only a ‘campaign’ in the same way that a pile of biscuits is ‘lunch.’ The missions are basic objectives like ‘Win 16 competitive rounds on Season’ or ‘Get 100 FAMAS kills in Deathmatch mode.’ And what do you get for completing them? Either a drop from an existing collection of guns, with a minor chance of a rare gun, or a weapon crate. The first is fair enough, but the second… I mean, at this point I already felt pretty rinsed by Operation Vanguard, and now it’s ‘rewarding’ me with crates that I need to pay more money to open.    There is a school of thought that says Valve has done this in order that a flood of new crates and mission rewards doesn’t flood the in-game economy, instead trickling them in over the coming months. To that argument the only appropriate response is – who cares? I play Counter-Strike: GO because it’s a great game, I don’t play it because of the economy, and while I accept the latter is how Valve makes money, the moment it starts intruding into the game – if indeed this explanation holds water – then the economy is not acting in the way that it should. That is, it should be improving the experience rather than throttling it.  The sad thing is that Operation Vanguard comes with my favourite selection of community maps yet, including two in Season and Back Alley that feel like potential classics. Yeah they’re all over the place in terms of favouring one side or the other, but this is par for the course with CS: GO and will be tweaked over the coming months. Every CS: GO operation freshens the game up with some new environments if nothing else, and the point of Operation Vanguard’s structure is to elongate this beyond a few days – to really showcase these excellent maps by forcing people to play on them semi-regularly for missions. It at least manages this.  I want to emphasise that I’m an enormous fan and c",1,0

"An okay tower defense game. Gets boring very quickly, but to be honest I really dislike the genre, hence why I might be prejudiced. If you like tower defenses, ignore my review, otherwise I recommend to pass on this one. It's just building traps and watching enemies walk into them and die. Sure, the game provides some challenge, but the gameplay itself is just setting up traps as quickly as possible and shooting some enemies from time to time.",1,0
"Now the thing to note with this review is that I am not complaining about the game. The game is fine, excellent, a real contender to the crap of Battlefield Play4free, but the only thing holding it back is the current licensee of the game, Aeria Games. Once upon a time, there was a company called Redduck, and they created a game called A.V.A. Now they licensed it as a free to play game under Ijji (for the US) and it revolutionized free to play games since it had PERMANENT WEAPONS. not once that timed out after some number of days, PERMANENT WEAPONS. Now, some games had this too, but AVA was different, you could get this permanent weapons for in game money, without ever having to pay a cent, (I was one of these users). In fact, while some would consider the game flopping with multitudes of free users, the game thrived, until Aeria Games noticed the competition and profits this game was making and decided to gain control of this mini-monopoly. While this went smooth at first, things started getting rough when Aeria started offering more and more items using its real money based currency-AP. At first, it was just skins, to make the existing guns look cooler, and no one had any complaints. But then, the game became unbalanced as the free users found themselves being outgunned by better weapons that one had to pay for. A new form of balance was needed, the switch to time weapons. However, while this might have balanced the game instead it ruined a once perfect game, for the OP (overpowered) AP gun were not timed (some were, but most weren't, at first), no, the igc (in-game-currency, the currency you get for playing the game) guns were timed, and soon, it was discovered they were nerfed (made weaker). One by one, the full time AVA players left, never to return again, today the game is in danger of being shut down. A dying FTP game, saving your money and play SF2 (Soldier Front 2). Its still living with events every week, and a growing fanbase, don't waste your time with AVA, under Aeria passes it on, fixes its issues, or worse, shuts the game down.  edit: this game has be ruined too much, there is no point in trying to start to play this game, only play if you are an older player who is returning, not a new player",1,0

"Let me start off by saying that the concept of this game is amazing. Who doesn't dream of having super powers? Being able to run, jump, and glide across city blocks in the blink of an eye is quite the rush. On top of that, being able to shapeshift at will (as a disguise or to transform your body into devestating weaponry).  The problem for me is after about 10 hours of playtime, why am I struggling to find the will to continue playing?  There's a story, but it feels like a narrative that I'm unlocking rather than experiencing. It's completly mission-based. The game quickly turns into a free-roam-the-city-to-start-x-event. To become more powerful I destroy and kill everything. To complete missions I destroy and kill. To learn more about the story... destroy and kill. Let me put it another way... you get reports on how many kills you get and how much money you cost the military, and the higher these numbers are the better your score is.  I could really only reccomend this game to people who: a. Like GTA style games (maybe only those who really enjoy stealing tanks and trying to evade the police) or b. Are into the revenge genre",1,0

"Few years ago, we first heard that CS 1.6 is dead, some organizations have dismissed their CS - team, people screaming that the game is dead and we need to move to CS: GO.

So why CS 1.6 is dead? I beg to differ. According to spectators IEM 6 CS was the best in the tournament. I think CS 1.6 hardly died, she would die only if we want to do! As for CS: GO it grows, developers even began to read the 'Feedback', the game has changed a lot of things.

"Initially this was a good game... no really- it was. I Mean who doesn't enjoy dropkicking helicopters to death in a 'free roam' environment. between a massive slew of unlockable powers and movement mechanics, some really stylish animation, and overall addictive gameplay- this game has a lot going for it. However, between a thin story (It could've been a lot better if there was just more character depth) and some maddeningly bad boss fights *cough* elizabeth green *cough* and the abysmel slew of bugs that invariably result in stunlocks and instant death- the latter parts of the game will probably leave you feeling like you should go play contra to unwind. for a game released in 2009 to have so many weird bugs is. well... not so great. Especially from a publishler like activision. Still the bugs arn't so bad as to completely ruin the game. All in all i'd give it a 6 out of 10. The animators did great, the graphics, for the time, are OK. (Would be better if not clearly aimed at consoles) the story and gameplay itself could be a little more solid. Still worth buying if you catch it on sale, but be prepared to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at a couple poorly designed boss fights, the ocassional unavoidable stunlock, enemies running around at mach 12, and the autotargetting system leaving you spinning in circles at 90mph.",1,0

"I used to play this a few years ago and this was a game worth playing. The campaign mode was good, the multiplayer mode was decent and it ran smoothly. I have started playing once more for the past three months and I will admit. I have had enough! The campaign may still be good (although it runs a little slower for me now) but the worst thing about this game is the darn multiplayer.  Allow me to tell you why for this one very good reason in my humble opinion:  It has been hacked to oblivion- I click to play TDM in the game mode selection menu, I wait to be connected to what appears to be a TDM and I somehow land up playing Domination. What makes things worse is that the host can reset the match at the end without allowing you to change up your classes in the after match intervals. This means you go straight back into to domination ON A TDM SERVER CHOICE. This, added with lightning fast quick scopes, grenade launcher addicts, bunny hoppers (people whom jump and shoot/ avoid fire), spawn campers (sitting near enemy respawning places to get easy kills) and the aimbots makes for a very unpleasent gaming experience.   While Treyarch/Activision and ect will have likely to have been furiously working away to conjure a new way to make the public £100 poorer with a sequal to a previous title, they have been forgetting to make sure that their older releases are still being maintained for the enjoyment of hardcore loyalists to the older games that were released. No anti-hack updates or PunkBuster equivilent software has been created to stave away the hackers which suck the joy out of everything.  This may be irrelevant now as no one will be buying this or caring anymore. However I hope the developers are aware that yes, there are still people who play the older games and unfortunately people sad enough to hack them also (probably because they are better than the recent ones i.e Ghosts and Advanced Warfare in my opinion are enormous piles of rubbish trying to keep up with Halo). Getting back to this game, I would not recommend it because of how frustratingly terrible the game has become to even attempt to play. If you want to be hounded by the feinds listed above then go for it, but not for me as I have had my fill and so with that I conclude by saying: consider yourselves warned.",1,0

"CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best  game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.  It starts off with a team trying to kill another team.   I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.  Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.  When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.  CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.  Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.  In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).",0,1
"Fun and dynamic combat-system with cringeworthy writing and uninviting corridoor maps tacked on in an attempt to create an RPG. The combat alone was engaging enough to play past the point where I started to hate the writing and claustrophobia was creeping in, but in the end I gave up hope that things would change and skill and gear progression made the fights too easy. A real let-down, this game, but I give it points for effort in the combat department. [4/10]",1,0

"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",0,1

"I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that.",1,0

The campaign for Modern Warfare 2 was an absolute masterpiece, you continue on from Call of Duty 4, playing as different branches, with different characters, though this game does have it's moments being a bit repetative later on in the game but something new always pops up to give you a boost of interest, the graphics for this game are amazing, huge step up from COD4, the AI is improved but still has it's moments where it is completely unintelligent and has no regard for itself, animations are great, many weapons throughout the campaign to choose from, the singplayer earns a 9/10. As for the multiplayer I cannot say the same, let me start off saying that Modern Warfare 2 is only worth playing for it's singeplayer due to the fact that the multiplayer is full of hackers all day everyday, and you can risk being deranked in a specific server, that goes with saying you can be at risk for a VAC ban for claims of cheating, the multiplayer is nice and all, lot's of intense fighting, however the hackers are the main reason why multiplayer is ruined for this, so I do not recommend this game for it's multiplayer.",1,0

"This game is not bad. It does not anger me, disappoint me, or rub me the wrong way. It's just kinda there. The game plays like a cross between poker and solitaire. You see your stacks of cards (top card only per stack, like in solitaire), and you see the same for your opponent. You move cards around like in solitaire, stacking them on other cards, except you're trying to make combinations of five cards, which can be poker combos like flushes, straights, etc. You then use those to attack your enemy, and vice versa. You have bonus card thingies on the side of your screen that you can use to attack when you build up enough rage.  It's an okay premise, but it doesn't really seem to change and the story is just okay. It's one of the least compelling games I've played. I have nothing against this game, which is really saying something. I typically love or hate a game, but this one is just kinda meh. I wouldn't recomment paying more than a Steam sale price, by any means, but I'd recommend you play the demo if you're interested. The gameplay you experience in 20-30 minutes of that is pretty much the entirety of the gameplay from what I've seen thus far. It's not very exciting or interesting, and nothing draws me in to make me want to keep playing. It's an okay game, but that's it.",1,0

"Counter-Strike, this one also known as Counter-Strike 1.6, is a team-based multiplayer realistical/military shooter. And a very well known one at that. It was first available as a free mod for Half-Life 1, being patched regulary up to version 1.6, until recently it got it's way onto Steam, as a serapately sold title.  So, how is the player base? Counter-strike 1.6, being popular self, has an active player base. You will see many servers, up to 32 players. At very least there are many Russian servers, as it had a cult following over there, can't really see past them. On bad side, most seems to prefer 'Terrorist plant C4' mode and then De_Dust2 is the most played map. A lot of servers run small mods, that may alter balance or other small things. And most of it, playerbase had a lot of time to play and master this game, so new players will be more frustated than having fun learning.  Counter-Strike is a very well known realistical FPS. It gained it's popularity while being free mod for popular Half-Life, because it provided something else what wasn't overused yet - realistical shootouts (using models of real weapons, you know) in team multiplayer. Unforgiving and furious. Or unbalanced and twitchy one-shot kills with headshots. Whichever one you prefer.   Counter-Strike has two types of map. First, 'de', is a mode where counter-terrorists have do defends few market spots on map from terrorist. One of the terrorists spawns with C4 in inventrory and has to bring it to one of the marked spots to plant it adn start to countdown of T's victory. Roles change as Terrorists will have now to defend this place from CTs, who's aim now are to defuse the bomb, in which case CTs will win the round, no matter how many more Ts are left. Pretty interesting mode and most played, otherwise this game would have been camping fest. And if one site is too well defended, Ts can go to another one. And then there is a second type, 'cs', in which CTs have to to rescue hostages by bringing them back to base. The problem there, is that hostage NPCs aren't perfect (though good enough) and since CTs have to rescue them all, Terrorist can camp in one of the spots around them, since CTs will have no choice but to come to win. Much less played and even if it does, it goes like your everyday Team Deathmatch, just killing all of opposite team. Much simpler anyway.  Now, the core gameplay... There are few rounds. Each round starts with each team spawning on their side of map. There is no respawning during round, once person is dead he is out, so you will have to worry much more about getting insta-killed. There are no items placed on map itself either (on correct, official maps), no kind of medikits. In spawn place, you have 15 seconds to press 'b' button (or whichever you set) to bring up 'buy menu', where you purchase weapons and equipment for the round witht he money that you earned so far. Yep, when round ends everybody gets some sum of money to spend, with winning team getting more, an ingenius design decision that helps losing team to get steamrolled even harder. What you can buy there is a pistol, primary weapon and any of the equipment. (Yep, if it doesn't smell like prototype of modern military shooters) Once past purchase screen, you are free to run and shoot. And here comes the art of recoil and aiming. For you see, one of the more important thing that is used in this game is accuaricy of your weapon. If you move it drops. if you jump, it drops. It drops while you are shooting too. Thus it becomes more importanly to get good position, making assaults more compilated, and you often have to relearn to shoot, making few clicks instead of just holding down mouse button. You will have to be often walking instead of running, to keep accuaricy while moving (it also makes you silent, so do it often), or just stand and crouch sometimes. Burst shooting is better there and for long range targets you want to be just click few times. Another important thing is that you can shoot through some walls with more powerful primary weapons. So don't be surprised for people shooting through door, walls and even just over the corner, it indeed does small damage to whoever is behind. The game also emphasises aiming because it supports headshots and they do a MASSIVE damage. And you also got three kinds of grenades. Explosive (HE), which explodes, good for throwing into chokepoints. Flashbang, which blinds whoever looked at it when it blows for few seconds, quite annoying but good for stroming into room. And Smoke Grenade, when you don't want enemies to see you coming and don't want to be under direct fire, good for open spaces with snipers (who instakill you when you peek around corner). Protip: You run slightly faster with knife out.  And well, while on theory it sounds interesting, as well as empashises teamwork. here comes the downfall of the game. The weapons, while make people with gun fetish happy, are badly balanced around each other. There are just best and bad weapons. From pistols Desert Eagle is the best, they behave as backup when you got no time to reload primary weapon. Shotguns are theorically good for close range but in this game they are useless and Assault Rifles can kill even better at close range. Sub-Machine Guns category had advantage of no accuaricy drops while moving, but are still inferior to Rifles. Rifles category has two best guns: all-range assault rifle like AK-47 and all-range sniper rifle like AWP (which doesn't even require headshot to one-hit kill), exactly what majority of people use. The only Machine Gun is 'pew pew pew can't hit'. And all-range is all-range, random is random. You may run and shoot in general direction of enemy and pull off a headshot from your AK-47 by luck. Or you may walk around corner, thinking of your next grandious tactical plan, just to get headshotted in insta-second by guy with sniper rifle from close range. It's just so full of cheap and frustating, the rage is probably the main thing that keeps players coming back for more, not honest fun, as well as luck of possibly pulling few magical headshots. Slow-down when being hit doesn't seem to be good idea either, making it harder to get away from the choke points. And random spread is not actually random, it just randomly follows one of the pre-set pattern. And yes, if you will learn them, you will be able to control your shooting better and get on top. Exactly what puts apart newbiews and elites, and exactly what elites seem to boast about when they want to say that Counter-Strike 1.6 is the best because it takes more skills and time to learn, with artifical challenges like this one that makes little sense. And well, once you spend your time to learn them, you will still find out on top that it didn't make the game any more amazing.  But you know, it's not too bad. It does teamwork well. Sometimes the game just works. When you work along the team, round the corners and storming the next room, where you follow teammates, supporting each other. Provide covering fire to the corner. When upon entering next place, each one covers his own direction, as some of the rooms just have too many places from which enemies can shoot you (smoke grenade and flashbangs help in these cases). And it's pretty damn nice at those moments, until they get ruined by something stupid, something you don't feel like could be prevented. Yea, getting shot by sniper.  And yes, this game has good enough sounds. No music, sadly. The graphics are quite HL1 high-definition era, but otherwise are fine enough. The levels are a bit of bland though.  Can't really recommend it. Because everybody who will like such games are already playing it. And player base of this game had too much time by now, that they will be just way too skilled for new players, who will just get destroyed and it will take a long time to get onto same level. It's not like there aren't enough military/realistical shooters anyway.",1,0

"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2010 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2012. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",0,1
"I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that.",1,0

"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 in itself is not really a bad shooter. It can be quite fun at times, but it's shortcomings are plenty and I would advise you purchase CoD 4: Modern Warfare instead.  The biggest problem this game has is the way servers are found. It has a 'matchmaking' system that forces you to join servers you know nothing about, which are then hosted by a random player in the game. See the problem? Due to this, prepare for wonderful amounts of lag in every game, and in case a player forced to host the server leaves, you have to wait for 30-60 seconds for the server to migrate host to another random player(in the middle of the match). Add to this the fact that you can't pick which settings on a server you prefer, be ready for things like people jumping 50m up and server playing slow-mo or being forced to spin 360 degrees for every bullet you fire.  Another problem are the hackers. Playing this game with a wallhack seems to be a must for most players, as every enemy knows where you are at any moment and will shoot you through walls without you moving an inch, throw grenades at your face or kill you before they even come around the corner(that one might just be the wonderful lag I'm talking about).  Also, the game has a big issue with large monitors. Despite having resolution set to that of my monitor, when aiming down the sight the mouse will move for 5-10 pixels for each 1 pixel it moves when I move my mouse on my desktop, making precision aiming impossible and forcing close quarter combat. Maps themselves also force this, as most of them are made to suit close combat, and you can forget about any sort of tactics, as they are made in a way where you're forced to go down a 'corridor'(whether it's a street, tunnel, building) and the enemy can come only from in front of you, or behind you.  Game modes offered are plenty, but dead. As the game works on forced matchmaking system, you can choose between TDM, DM, Hardcore TDM and S&amp;D. TDM, however, usually contains 80% of the player base, which is around 500 players online normal times.  The game falls short of it predecessor in almost every aspect. Avoid my mistake, as now I'm angry I wasted 12.49€ on this instead of buying CoD4: MW as I originally planned.",1,0

"Advantages: a good idea, an opportunity to play on a network Disadvantages: poor performance, graphics, textures, defects. Collection of my reviews on video games continues. Today we will speak about the most famous first-person shooter 'Counter-Strike'.  Igrushechki this appeared quite a long time, already in the year 2000 and won the gamers. Then all these 'shooters' were a novelty, and of course all like this game. I knew about it a long time, I heard enthusiastic talks about it, heard the word 'bots', 'contra', 'headshot of', 'ks'. And what is it, I managed to learn five or six years ago. Games then I was not 'tempted', but even then I have appreciated this game for three and a minus. Why? I'll explain later. Now the whole of the game. Created her notorious guys with the short name 'Valve'. About 'Valve's' I will say this: all of their games on the subject stopped 'fantasy' and 'half-real.' And this game belongs to the second category.  So, the creators of the idea is quite tempting. Confrontation of the law against terrorists. They gave the game the proud name of 'Counter-Strike', ie 'counter-attack', but that's just shock, as such, no intrigue in this game. And that is? There are running with a gun, a gun, a knife. Oh yes, there is another grenade (use 0). And you can take the shield (not a bad thing). We can play for the 'special forces' (which I did) and terror (very few people want). Most probably the main thing here is that we can play a 'bot' that is, our friends runs the computer, the computer runs our enemies, but we can play and through the network, where all have real people. Play over the Internet more interesting, but still 'stupid'.  I do not want to talk about any reality or fiction, but all I will say. I have not seen, not in movies, not in life, to special forces, and the terrorists jumped as the 'hare', climbed the stairs, as if running on the ground. And finally, it is that even the slightest preparation is absent, the men can not hit no shield, no weapons, no arms / legs. The hostages, but here too there are, behave calmly, stand, no one is afraid of fear or cry.  So, I criticized a little, and now tell you about the features. Game modes are different, rescuing hostages, rescue VIP-a, defusing a bomb, knife, grenade. A quest we give money, we buy ourselves, that it is necessary, for example, body armor (a rare case when it is not worn in advance on fighter (in reality)). On the job, we allocated time, which is usually enough. Each of the men says that he wants and commands that it is possible to give no one is listening. By the way, there you can sprinkle a logo that can be selected in advance. Beauty is not gaining.",0,1

"Initially this was a good game... no really- it was. I Mean who doesn't enjoy dropkicking helicopters to death in a 'free roam' environment. between a massive slew of unlockable powers and movement mechanics, some really stylish animation, and overall addictive gameplay- this game has a lot going for it. However, between a thin story (It could've been a lot better if there was just more character depth) and some maddeningly bad boss fights *cough* elizabeth green *cough* and the abysmel slew of bugs that invariably result in stunlocks and instant death- the latter parts of the game will probably leave you feeling like you should go play contra to unwind. for a game released in 2009 to have so many weird bugs is. well... not so great. Especially from a publishler like activision. Still the bugs arn't so bad as to completely ruin the game. All in all i'd give it a 6 out of 10. The animators did great, the graphics, for the time, are OK. (Would be better if not clearly aimed at consoles) the story and gameplay itself could be a little more solid. Still worth buying if you catch it on sale, but be prepared to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at a couple poorly designed boss fights, the ocassional unavoidable stunlock, enemies running around at mach 12, and the autotargetting system leaving you spinning in circles at 90mph.",1,0

"This is an alright game. The story is interesting and the mechanics are kind of fun. The game offers over 100 hours of adventuring fun. The skills allow you to fully customize your character into three different skill trees and get special bonuses depending on how you do it. You can also respec as many times as you like(with ample coin).  However, this game has some glaring problems. For one, the game is plagued by copious bugs. It is very frustrating to have to reload the game once or twice an hour because you get stuck in a loading screen, or stuck in the floor, or because the game just feels like randomly crashing. The game also has a strange and clunky cheap feeling to it. The cities are filled with guards who have strange psychic powers and can sense wrong doing from half a mile away. You're allowed to play good or evil and make choices in a Mass Effect like style. This is fun until you realize that your choices really don't matter much. You can go into a town and kill everyone, but that just means you killed a bunch of quest givers, so there really isn't a point. It feels like EA put a lot of effort into making the expansions and just left the bugs, because fixing bugs doesn't make money.  Overall this was an okay game and I recommend it if you'd like a nice time sink, can get it cheap, and can overlook the cheap design and buggy gameplay.",1,0

"RECOMMENDED JUST FOR NOSTALGIA, besides that, NOT RECOMMENDED!  It's the father to the modern Counter Strikes and FPS in general. That's a fact, but that doesn't mean you should play this. We have CSGO now, it would be ridiculous to pick up a old, outdated and dying game like CS 1.6. Those who play it do so cause they've been doing it for 15+ years, but no new players arrive and it is too much blocky graphically to be even considered for purchase these days.  Great game, but too old/outdated and dying. Don't recommend, unless you're here to get some nostalgia from the old days.

"'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.' A review by Richard Valkinsenn.  EDIT: My original review of Modern Warfare 2 has been updated to reflect my changed opinion of the game. I have a lot to say about it, and not a lot of it's good. The review is now broken up into two sections and will cover the game's campaign and multiplayer suites, respectively.  ---- CAMPAIGN REVIEW ----  Modern Warfare 2 is the pinnacle of the Call of Duty series, second only to it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. Unfortunately, factoring in both the game's single-player and multiplayer suites, that's not really saying much. Campaign-wise, admittedly, Modern Warfare 2's campaign does feature a thrilling, well-acted campaign, and comes packed with thrills and chills, the latter of which is mostly contained in the campaign's notorious 'No Russian' mission. While the campaign's level design is linear, thankfully the player is given a wide variety of roles throughout the game's runtime. One level will feature a tense series of firefights with loads of enemies while another will have the player moving stealthily in a semi-linear fashion from point A to point B. As for long-lasting appeal, somehow, Modern Warfare 2 has a charm that has withstood the test of time.  The campaign also features a co-op mode featuring missions based on scenarios seen not just in Modern Warfare 2 but also it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. These missions are widely varied and feature time attacks, stealth missions, and other various modes for up to two players to engage in. There are a few missions which require no less than two players, but thankfully, the majority of the missions can be completed solo, if players so desire.  Sadly, while the campaign and co-op modes are pretty solid, as far as a PC port goes, the entire package as a whole is found wanting. For starters, the game's options lack many essential PC features, like a Field of View (FOV) slider. In fact, it seems the developers went out of the way to make it difficult to even edit the native FOV via console or cfg edits. Not to mention the fact that the lack of separated audio sliders makes trying to tailor the game's audio experience to one's liking impossible. What makes it even worse is the lack of mod support, meaning basically that making custom content for the game is something that's just not gonna happen. Above all else, what makes it all even worse is the game's multiplayer suite, which only serves to highlight many of the game's glaring faults.  Campaign Verdict: I liked it.  ---- MULTIPLAYER REVIEW ----  Years ago, I played Modern Warfare 2 on Xbox LIVE and rather enjoyed it. However, having transitioned to the PC in the last several years and having played other, superior online titles, I've found Modern Warfare 2's PC multiplayer suite to be nothing short of a train wreck.  In addition to the glaring lack of an FOV slider, so much power and choice was taken out of the player's hands in this game. Dedicated servers, or at least a server browser for choosing matches is non-existent. Voting to kick or ban problematic players was left out. Mod support for custom content is gone. A much-needed feature like hiding the in-game chat log is just not there. And sure you could host a private match, but hosting a public match with custom rules and map rotations is a thing of the past. Well, unless you hack it in, but then you run the risk of getting hit with a Valve Anti-Cheat ban.  Then you get to the actual gameplay that Modern Warfare 2 has to offer... and it gets a little better and a lot worse from there. While MW2's maps are thankfully not as restrictive as later titles in the overall series, they still suffer from a near-complete lack of interactivity. Not everything about the maps is terrible, however, as they do allow for a multitude of different tactics and approaches, though this also applies to hiding spots and long, open stretches for campers to exploit. As far as the game's arsenal and perks go, there's a lot of room for mixing and matching to create a lot of different approaches and playstyles. At the same time, weapon customization is sadly hampered by the fact that only one attachment is allowed at a time, though a certain perk can allow up to two. However, adding this perk to a loadout means that no other perks in that perk's category can be applied.  Above all else, there's one thing that makes Modern Warfare 2 just about unbearable at any time, and it's an issue that also extends to the entire series, overall. A lot of the methods for getting kills in Modern Warfare 2 require little to no skill to employ. An example would be the addition of quick, one-hit knife kills that can be require little more than a button press, in addition to lethal traps that can be laid for other players. Several of the game's perks also exacerbate this, like a perk that expands the lethal radius for explosives or another that increases the distance over which knife kills apply. Not to mention the fact that the game doesn't treat fired shots like projectiles; once the sights are lined up, bullet hits are instantly guaranteed, no matter the distance.  Overall, while it has many high points, Modern Warfare 2 on the PC leaves way too much to be desired. A glaring lack of much-needed PC features along with an array of lackluster gameplay features sours an online and even offline experience with lots of untapped potential.  Multiplayer Verdict: It could've been much better.",1,0

"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.",0,1

"The games dead. Its basically worthless to anyone in USA unless you want to play with third worlders. Even then theres only a few servers it looks like. I would rather die than play with South Americans. Anything south of the US border is just hell ( I have never had a positive experience online with these people and if you know anything about geopolitics I need not go into that), so I advise not dealing with these peoples idiocy and just going with CSGO these days unless you want to LAN this game.  One of the greatest FPS games to ever come out and will forever remain a classic but also a game that can still compete design and gameplay wise with games released in more current times. We will never have the natural form of support from players and ESPORTS ever again. This is before ESports was just a way for devs to market and shill a game. This was from when people who liked to play a game competed and not just a bunch of rich kids trying to win monetary prizes like ESports is now (who else could play CSGO all day erry day in this economy?)  People got behind this game because they liked it, instead CSGO is all about market manipulation and human psychology manipulating with less consideration about gameplay because they want the most monetary return. If the idiots will pay hundreds for a digital knife skin then why would any company invest in gameplay that won't have direct returns like a digital nongood would have?  The video game market is full of idiots who will dump money into anything now just so they can distract themselves from the politcs, economics, and slowly declining living conditions of the western world. Bread and circus in its truest form.  CS 1.6 is from better days, more honest days. When people who wanted to make games, and people who wanted to play games were very closely related and the average IQ of someone who was online was higher than now. These days every idiot has an internet connection. That is to say, the target audience then was just better than the target audiences of todays games. This is exampled many times in economics.

"One will find it is quite easy to encounter persons of highly polished skills in the original version of the Counter-Strike games. This is evidenced by thousands of hours on many of the players records; keep in mind that Steam has not been tracking game hours for a good few years after it first came out with this mod!  I highly suggest one passes by this out of date game, as classic as it may be. I compare an exaggeration of the experience for a new player to that of being anally entered, spontaneously, by barbed nethers. Overwhelming, painful, and a strong sense of defenselessness.  One would do well to instead spend their time playing the latest, 'sexiest' version, anyway. After all, the gameplay is an evolution on the one this game has to offer. I also recommend passing over the current middle-child version: Source.",1,0
