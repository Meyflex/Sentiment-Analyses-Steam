"Fall Girls is a bit of a tough game to recommend at the moment. It without a doubt has some decent level design and some fun challenges, but it can often feel a bit clunky and sloppy at times. The game as stated on it's page is not multiplayer at all, but it does have some NPCs for you to race against. Unfortunately these NPCs are entirely a cosmetic addition and have no real actual impact on the game play. There is no requirement or even extra reward for beating them.

The game does some things well such as the time trial levels which are definitely tightly tuned, but always fair and challenging. The only real major problem I encountered as far as level design was the fans on the platform level do not boost you high enough to complete the course, so the game may be unbeatable until a patch is out.

I would also like to mention that there is no true H content in the game for those interested. You can unlock a couple mildly ecchi swimsuit CGs that do look great and are well animated, but are not true H content. The game is also unfortunately not one hand playable as you'll need to use both your keyboard and mouse.

Overall the game is a pretty decent parody game that you can kill an hour or two with, but without any real H content, it's a bit hard to justify it's current asking price.

If you'd like to see a closer look at what the game has to offer I have a short video review over on YouTube.

"Lovely game but the controls are a mess.

For someone thats not used to use the keyboard for palying games, this felt like a torture. I cannot even get too far in the story, I cant concentrate because i have to see what im doing, correcting the camera, pressing the rigth buttons... It wasnt a good experience and I HATE thta because i was waiting on this game and was so, so happy to finally being able to play it. Try to fix this, please.",1,0

"So where to start with this one...

OK so as many have pointed out, the setting of a hotel is quite good and you get to pet the kitty at the start! but thats about all I have to say thats really great about this one.

Im just going to list what I didnt like and what could be done to fix it in my own humble opinion. 

* Way too short, This can be finished even as a first time player in under 30 mins. maybe 20 if you know what your doing. I noticed when walking around there is a room you can see into and clearly there is interiors in some of the rooms so they could have been utilized. also [spoiler]The generator room could have had a minigame of some sort to open it maybe? seemed anticlimatic to press E on the door and a spoop jumpscare jpg hit you [/spoiler] there is a lot of untapped potential here in this map

* The voices and Voice acting. I can only assume it was translated with Google Translate then ran through a Text-To-Speech for the ""Voice Acting"". Im fairly sure some people would be happy to lend their voices and send some snippets. Why not reach out to the community? though wont like ""Thanks you babe"" is going down in the history books for this game. Also maybe clean up the little girls translation some... she accuses the player character of wanting to do something that did make me :/

* Please raise the camera height a bit for the player, when I was in rooms and such the perspective made me think I was 4ft tall

* Increase the run speed, its hardly better than walking speed... though walking speed is also slow too

* Rework the ending text - wont lie I hardly understood the ending text at all but got the ""gist"" of it

* Some optimisation work is needed, just some general polish under the hood and maybe some work on the lighting as well (clean room objective is an example of that)",1,0
Give an option for friends from other regions to join each other. Then its good,1,0
"Poor optimization. Control sucks, menu navigation sucks. English translation sucks. Tutorial sucks. No legend for map. No pathfinding, I don't know where to go. Some mechanics suck. Art direction is good.
Still, this game has a room to improve",1,0

"As many who bought this game, I came here after Hyper Light Drifter entered my favorite games of all time list.

Solar Ash isn't bad on its own. But nowadays, so many games are just that so it ends up being forgettable.

I think that while a lot of the same elements are back, the very cohesion of it all that made HLD blew my mind isn't there on this project. Because the game is different, the same formula actually misses its target. For example I think Disasterpeace fits completely with the mystery and cryptic narration of HLD but after one playthrough there was no moment in SA that I remember his music to have hit me. Maybe the fact that there are dialogues? very defined visual elements in a 3D world as opposed to pixel-art?
Hard to tell.

Once again, it's still enjoyable so if you want to play it, then play it because you will probably enjoy something in it. But if you're expecting to buy a masterpiece, it's not.

"Bilattice offers grid logic puzzles you solve by shading cells in the style of Taiji, where you figure out the rules by experimenting. You'll have more fun in this style by playing Taiji before this, or indeed The Witness, Cosmic Express, Understand and Gridspech. Consider this when you're at the point of playing the good version of Pixoji or What the Witness?

If instead you come from a paper puzzle background in the Nikoli style, the core rule is the Light & Shadow variant of Nurikabe. You are best served in electronic form by the puzzles presented in the pzv/puzz.link editor/database, pedroworks, or the various versions of penpa/expo. Consider this when you want to face a rolling mix and match of styles that requires little browsing.

The learning the rules bit is supported by a curated manual inclusion of area counters, clue validators and automatic grid validation, which is an excellent approach. There's also the option to read the rule straight up that eventually shows up, so you're never hard stuck from ignorance. If you pass it up and eventually concede you need it though, you have to find which specific puzzle randomly contains the ""spill the beans"" button. The game forgets your solution when you're not looking at it, so experimentation across puzzles or sessions is obnoxious.

There's a couple of novel and interesting things eventually done here, one involving a relaxing of shading and one involving puzzle validation, but overall not every rule interacts in an deep, interesting way with every other. In design terms, some boxes in the interaction matrix are pretty sparse.

Most of the puzzles aren't for teaching though, but for breeding familiarity and eventually providing challenge. The puzzles themselves seem to be made in different ways, and not all are equally good. There's puzzles whose solving path is designed and you can see it, there's sequences of slightly changing aesthetically pleasing grids, and there's a lot of puzzles where it's very hard to see an articulate, human idea communicated. There's also a couple of options to solve computer generated puzzles under time constraint.

The map is astonishingly bad in several ways. Rather than spread out in 2D, it's a scrollable cone that drops into new screens every once in a while. This introduces a ton of clicking and dragging between functionally indestinguishable screens to find open puzzles in mid-game and makes it impossible to remember where a specific puzzle was. It's also thinly connected, so it makes it extra easy to get stuck. The linearity makes sense for tutorials, but most of the game is not that, and the difficulty is not tuned enough to assume subsequent puzzles would also be a problem.

The UI is a prank. There's absolutely no keyboard support. There's no undo. Where similar games offer cell colours, border marking, exhausted clues marking, freehand drawing, trial locks and so on this offers the ability to mark a cell as unshaded. The button named Main Menu opens the quit confirmation. The randomiser modes can be found in two different map screens, one of which looks like a puzzle and the other is just a button attached to the terrain opening a menu. The X in a square in the puzzle corner is not quit the puzzle, validate the puzzle, or a checkbox, it's ""erase the shading"". The 3x3 dot button is not a menu dropdown, it's map despite the map not being a grid. If you want to change how assistance works, you have to leave the puzzle, open a menu, and find the puzzle again instead; and you'll want to move back and forth between settings because you want different ones for tutorials and puzzles where single changes have very wide repercussions and would force you to slowly recalculate a bunch of stuff.

The UI slowly broke me. By slowly, I mean I went looking for a refund just after the 2 hour window. I'm resigned to finishing it now. Well, maybe not the integration puzzle. Your mileage may vary.",1,0

"Had potential but you can tell it's half-baked, a real shame. this is probably one of my favorite franchises of all time and I'm only ""enjoying"" it off the love I feel towards the series as a whole. If you know nothing this game's PowerPoint presentation of a story will invest you 0% and make you care little to nothing about the source material. The gameplay is kind of fun I guess feels generic and like you can only do so much with it. sometimes nicely animated cut scenes bring this to life, but they are short-lived as they immediately follow up with a slideshow of the next 3 to 4 episodes narrated over. Also, the fact it only covers 45 episodes out of 100 is criminal there is so much story left to be told and I don't think it will ever be told to be honest nor should it be told if the way it's gonna be told would continue to be like this. 
missions are short and it's like OK finish one mission go to the Overworld view hit the next mission or story mark, it's poorly executed and ruins any potential immersion you would've had with this game. Can be best described as a mobile game.

Overall I give this a 5/10 simply because I love the series otherwise an unbiased review would be more like a 4 cus this game is some poopgurt.

If you love this series I guess you might enjoy reliving some of it but overall it's not worth 60 bucks. maybe 15 and that's a robbery still.",1,0

"The idea of the game is quite nice and it has pretty good features. However, the shooting process is too bad. The bar is not so much easy to be hit on time (Even though we are the police officer). I would expect to shoot to people easier than this. I missed 50-60% of my attempts, but the people hit me all the time. If they do not miss any, why there is a possibility for us to miss then? I know that the game is still in BETA, For that reason, I would like to see that these problems are solved after sufficient amount of period",0,1
"It needs a lot of work in some areas, I.E you will die to enemies that aren't pointing guns at you, Enemy NPCs can spawn right next to you and instantly end your run, and the meta is to  sit behind a wall because the enemies are programmed to walk straight towards you immediately, and they'll often kill themselves when 20 of them try to stand in the same spot",0,1

"While the writing continues to be compelling, expansive, and thrilling, there are STILL noticeable bugs/sections in the Part that falter the suspension of disbelief. 
These ARE potentially ground-breaking for a game that is entirely Narrative. 

*Within 'The Museum' sections especially, Tommy/Bailey/Lopez are often excluded from descriptions or dialogue and then suddenly reappear in the scene, or a Group member can die and suddenly be alive again n such *bugs. 
*Or like Bailey is shot, and suddenly she is no longer in the scene AT ALL. But when you get back into camp apparently she is still a group member....and nothing was explained or elaborated about her injuries.
*or the entire task/building/improvements system for the Junkyard; tasks can be completed but will continue to show up both within options to start tasks, and to continue working on said tasks. Also improvement effects don't seem to be fully operational, and the descriptions of completed tasks or in-progress tasks does seem to be lacking in parts/buggy as well. 
This system just feels broken in this part, while with the original Zombie Exodus game, and with both Part I and II of Zombie Exodus: Safe Haven this system is PHENOMENAL and creates an awesome building up your 'Safe Haven' aspect to the gameplay, in this part it just feels hollow, barebones, and buggy. 

Just needs some TLC and more description around and within the improvement system and to fix the existing 'buggy-ness' and it will be GREAT.

"You run a shop to pay off debt, similarly to Recettear. Every 10 days there is a progress check via potion challenges that you need to pass. This requires providing specific potions of specific quality. Failing to do so will lead in a game over and reloading an older save to optimize. Do not let the cute visuals of the game fool you, this is not a casual game. This is an optimization game. 

There are many things the player needs to consider: which potions to craft, which specific ingredients to use, which pots to use/buy/upgrade, which specific shelves to use/buy/upgrade, which adventurer to visit and to send out to which specific region with which specific potions, which items to buy and when, which temporary buffs to acquire, which cards to play and in what order, which NPCs to focus on in order to unlock cards, which potions to sell when, and on and on.
There are literally hundreds of small possible interactions that all contribute towards the efficiency of running the shop. One does not have to nail all those things mentioned, but failing to at least attempt to optimize a bit will shove casual players who do not optimize into a literal dead end. If you want a cutesy casual shop experience without having to think too much, this game isn't for you. If you enjoy optimizing, this game is for you.

While I do enjoy the game, and the presentation is fantastic, I also kind of loathe the busy work it gives me. Just running around and gifting everyone gifts, and re-sending people onto adventures, and refilling my pots, etc. definitely feels a bit like busywork. 

I do like the card game mechanic, where you unlock cards the further you progress with the games characters. It's fun unlocking a few cards and then fiddling with the deck to see which strategy results in the most gold earned. I would have liked a simple mulligan though. 

tldr: good game mechanics, great presentation, gameplay a bit work-intensive, not very forgiving.",0,1

My true and honest review... the game is fun at first and the combinations you can make with your characters is decent. The moment you realize this is a never ending game.. is the moment the magic dies. You are constantly Killing monsters - > crafting better gear --> killing stronger monsters --- > crafting better gear. That is essentially the game play loop... in the future those who join later will never catch up to veteran players.,1,0

"""Final Vendetta"" from Bitmap Bureau and Numskull Games is a 2022 beat-'em up remade in the image of classic series like ""Final Fight"" and ""Streets of Rage"" and even built on classic Neo Geo hardware. Seriously, this game looks like something out of ""King of Fighters '96"" or something, which is extremely cool. But while this does have the spirit of the classic button crunchers of old, there are various differences here and I would say that potential purchasers should be aware of how different this game can be.

To start off, this is not ""particularly"" a pick up and play sort of beat-'em up, like FF or SOR. This is more of a ""thinking man's"" knuckle brawler, in which if you run into an enemy and just expect to button mash and rack up KOs, you're going to get hurt and get hurt bad. Each character (Duke, Claire, and Miller) has specialized attacks meant for crowd control, defense, and maneuvering, and you have to utilize those moves well and read the situation of enemies if you want to survive. I'll use Duke, for example. Duke has a running uppercut (Run + Attack) which can sort of close distances with far away enemies and catch them off guard. Duke also has two different combo enders at the end of his standard attack string, one which does a standard punch to knock enemies down and keep them close (X, X, X, X) or he also has a combo ender that can kick enemies away in case you need them pushed back (X, X, X, Forward + X). If you want to juggle some enemies that are airborne, Duke also has a flaming series of punches (Block + Special) and a running flip kick (Run + Special) that can help to rack up some damage and keep crowds under control in case they get out of hand. So each character has tools that can be used to put the hurt on enemies and make sure your precious lifebar doesn't end up drained.

So...why did I put part of Duke's movelist in this review and talk about these tools in the first place? That's because, first off, there is no movelist in the game to speak of and I had to find this stuff out on my own instead of having something to refer to for these moves. Furthermore, there is a ""Training Mode"" that is featured in the game...but it is locked behind the need to beat the game first before it opens. So if there is no way for the player to even learn these moves (except through experimentation) with no movelist, no way to practice said juggles and combos, and the mode that could help them is locked behind having to finish the game FIRST, why even have it locked in the first place? These aspects of the game should be unlocked and clarified to the new player in some way that has never played the game, just for them to get the lay of the land before they get started in the ""Arcade Mode.""

Additionally, with the controls given, this game is no where as fluid or smooth as ""Streets of Rage"" or ""Final Fight."" It might be because of the Neo Geo hardware, but this game feels a bit stiff. When a character runs, they can't run diagonally, and there is a way for the player to dash up and down AND they can somehow dash diagonally, but I can't pull the latter off consistently. If you jump at enemies to try and do a jumping down attack on them, they just end up punching you out of the air. For Miller, sometimes, if you try to start punching an enemy, your punch animation takes so long to start up that enemies can start punching you right away and can keep you stunned -- so you really have to find a way to move around your enemies before you start attacking (focusing on positioning first). And there are other aspects of the controls that make this a bit more troublesome than your average beat-'em up. I'm not saying that this is a horrible or ""bad"" game, but I'm saying that it may take a bit of time and experimentation to get going with this starting off. And once again, I have to emphasize the need for the ""Training Mode"" to be unlocked from the start and the addition of a movelist to get people familiar with all the moves each character has to offer upfront.

I will, say however, that the style of the game and the music are both phenomenal; the music in particular! Parts ""Streets of Rage"" and parts ""Street Fighter III: Third Strike,"" this is some seriously fantastic music behind this game and it is a shame that the gameplay is as rigid as to not potentially enjoy ""Final Vendetta"" to its fullest in tandem with the music. I also wish that there was one more character (possibly hidden) that could be added to the game to round out the roster a bit more, especially in the wake of so many modern beat-'em ups having many, many styles of characters to choose from. 

Overall, I think if the controls are loosened a bit and the implementations that I talked about are put in, ""Final Vendetta"" could be a very solid game that many more people could enjoy, no matter if they are veterans or new to this genre of games. But as of right now, as much as I have played this style of games over the past 20+ years, I can't recommend this game fully unless the player looking into this game understands that it might take some time for you to get used to the controls without the ""Training Mode"" or a way to practice combos. And also be aware that the enemies might get on your nerves if you don't know how to block effectively or know your way around the mechanics of the various characters. 

In the end, Godspeed to anyone looking to try this game out. It is a decent ride, but just a little too bumpy along the way for me.",1,0

"This is one of my Top 5 Favorite Games of ALL-Time.

[b]Should you [i]Play[/i] FRONT MISSION?[/b] [i]By All Means[/i]

[b]Should You Buy The PC Version on  STEAM?[/b] [i](which is a PORT of the SWITCH Remake?)[/i]
[b]Oh. No.[/b]

The TL;DR: is So Classic as to be Cliché: They Didn't [i]Actually[/i] Remake Front Mission for PC but instead simply adapted the SWITCH Version to run on PC and that means- Yeah! You Guessed it!- 

[B]THERE'S NO NATIVE KEYBOARD & MOUSE INPUTS CODED INTO THE GAME[/B]

Effectively, what does  that mean? I means when you use your Keyboard & mouse with this game in any standard way that it's input translator does not have a direct equivalent for the game will freeze up, examples include:

Pressing ESC to tab out/back from a Menu: [b][i]Soft-Locks the Game[/i][/b]
Clicking on Wanzers during an effect animation: [b][i]Soft-Locks the Game[/i][/b]
Having a Multi-Screen Display Set-Up &
   moving the mouse to another Screen: [b][i]Soft-Locks the Game[/i][/b]
Clicking on the screen too much during dialog:[b][i]Soft-Locks the Game[/i][/b]
Not Clicking the Screen enough during dialog: [b][i]Soft-Locks the Game[/i][/b]
Moving the Mouse Too Much, Causing it to Dissapear: [b][i]Soft-Locks the Game[/i][/b]
Not Moving the Mouse Enough, Causing it to Dissapear: [b][i]Soft-Locks the Game[/i][/b]
....

How Prevalent are these Issues? 
I've been playing every day for the past two weeks and the Game Soft-Locks on me [i]At Least[/i] Once A Day. 
I'd been holding off on Writing this Review in the hopes that they'd address it in the last two bug-fixes but the Mouse Cursor Vanished on the Mission Tally Screen at the End of the Level, thus Soft-Locking the Game and forcing you to have to re-play the level All Over Again (a Fairly Common Occurance) no Less than [b]FOUR TIMES IN A ROW[/b] and I just couldn't any longer, so Here it is:

DO NOT BUY THE STEAM VERSION OF THIS GAME-
Get the SWITCH, The DS Version, Now, I would *[b]Never[/b]* Suggest, much less [i]Advocate[/i] someone load up the Rom-lations, but as a value-proposition, especially if the 35 credits are considerable chunk of your recreational budget the fact that there is already a fully-functional English-Language PC version of this title [i]for free[/i] that operates flawlessly with computer inputs seriously affects the STEAM PC port's value-proposition.


----


[i]I bought this version of the game. Twice; first for my brother on the SWITCH for his birthday and second for myself on the PC. I love this game, I've played it to at least completion on minimum three different platforms over a twenty year span. If you're already considering playing this, let me tell you the chances are good you'll really love it. 
But it's precisely [/i]because[i] if you play this you'll most likely be investing serious hours in it that these bugs are going to be an issue and why if you can, you'd be better off picking up one of the console versions. 

The 35 monies is not something I'll miss, the days are (hopefully forever) long-gone for me when I was lucky if I had 100 bucks to dole out over a week's worth of expendable income. But I do remember that feeling, and I know that if the pricepoint here is 1/3 of what you got to spare after ramen & rent spending it on [/i]anything[i] is a big deal. Okay, spiel over.

One last thing, the devs are working away at the bugs and it may fast come the time when these issues are cleared up. If or when that happens I'll be overjoyed to erase & re-work the review into a solid thumbs-up. The dev team seems earnest & I'll continue to invest in their success
[/i]


Good Luck & High-Five



 [u][b] CAVEAT: [/b] The ""Not Recommended"" Aspect of the Review is for  [b][i]The STEAM PC Port Expressly[/i][/b] of Forever Entertainment's SWITCH adaptation of FRONT MISSION 1st with Keyboard & Mouse. Using a Gamepad or playing it on a Consolewill [b][i]most likely[/i][/b] run without the problems mentioned as they look to be directly connected to Keyboard & Mouse Input.[u]",1,0

"The tutorial was a bit confusing to traverse. I didn't know how to apprehend the suspects because I didn't speak to the guy at C-1 a second time, and there was no indication that I should have. Because of this, I started the first level believing that to apprehend suspects, I had to confront them and ""immobilize"" them, which always resulted in their death. I did this because I had though that this was the method to apprehend them. Also because I wasn't told how to apprehend at C-1, I thought that the challenge was to sneak past the guy walking in the room, which always resulted in a fail, making me waste time. A-1 was easy enough to follow, although when I tried to aim for the hand to ""disarm"" the suspect, the option never came up. I wish that it is made more clear on how to do this.

The supermarket level was a pain to get through. I had gone into the level believing that I could apprehend all three suspects, however the first suspect cannot be apprehended, as he can't be distracted and is facing towards you, and the second suspect moves too fast and is impossible to apprehend unless you have a fast sneaking speed. If a suspect cannot be distracted or apprehended, I wish that there is a way to know when this is the case, as this has made me waste considerable time.

With that said, the second and third level were pretty engaging. They allowed you to choose to either confront or distract and stun the suspect, allowing me more freedom and suiting my choice of playstyle better.

Overall it was a nice experience. A bumpy start, but it ended with me being satisfied of the game that I had played. Looking forward to where this will end up.",0,1

"It's a real fun game but a note of warning to new players.

The plot is poorly structured in this game. After playing 13+ hours leveling up and getting powerful companions in different parts of the map, I would enter a town and suddenly a plot narrative will run and I will be meeting and talking to characters that I've never met before. I don't know why this is happening. Either I'm getting companions I'm not supposed to yet or that I'm at a higher level than I should be and the plot activates. This made the game unplayable for me as I'm kinda a story guy and I have to replay the whole game just to know what on earth happened. 

Also, after hours of research as a newbie and not getting an answer to cultivation books, here's a quick tip. You can ONLY have 4 cultivation books and each book you level up will directly change your HP and MP. If you remove the book, the benefits will leave until you supplant it with another book and level that up. However, whatever  meridian points you get from leveling up a cultivation book is permanent. So when peeps in reviews and forums say level up as many cultivation books as you can it's because they want the permanent meridian points. Remember, you remove the cultivation book, you remove the increase in HP and MP. 

Because the story is so integral to games such as these, think Octopath Traveller or Fire Emblems, I won't recommend the game until they fix the narrative plot points and stop it from running havoc. Because plot holes just made me scrunch my face like a bull dog and throw tantrums.",1,0

"The game itself is a perfectly fine autorunner. There's not a lot here, but what is here is solid. For 3 bucks, it's exactly what you pay for.

Below is my old review and has since been outdated. I'm keeping it here for record purposes..

That said, I'm giving this a negative review for bad faith advertisement.
-The capsule shows a realistic looking man, but the in game doesn't fit the game at all. If he's the protagonist, I can hardly tell.
-This game is an Autorunner and NOTHING in ""About"" section says that. Even the trailer doesn't say that. I thought it was just a small platformer, but once I found out they removed the means to let me control the character, I'm not interested. If other people want an autorunner, that's fine, but the steam page should say that.
-Also, because it's an auto runner, it says ""Simple two-button controls"", implying it's jump and attack. However, there's 3 buttons because the range attack you get in some levels has its own button. This is a nitpick

I don't want to sound harsh to a 3 dollar game. I just think it's wrong when it feels like the steam page is hiding key information. I'll give the developer the benefit of the doubt and assume it wasn't intentional, but I'm still refunding this game. Not because it's bad, but because I don't like autorunners. If the steampage changes to make it clear it's an autorunner, I'll switch this recommend.",0,1

I understand it's an indie title, but for crying out loud, did the dev actually play any type of racing sim/game? I highly doubt it!
Firstly, the control system, what were you thinking???

No reverse gear, but rather hit R to respawn, which ive noticed people spam and cause all sorts of mayhem in corners.

Secondly, ZERO mouse support for smooth steering and acc/dec using mouse buttons, over correction in racing games is a no no.

Thirdly, why the hell would you implement serious slow down while running over grass or general off track?

Menu system is all over the place. 

Steering is overall really janky and myself and many others in-game are over correcting and crashing, it needs to be much smoother... and dont get me started on the braking dynamics...

Apart from that, graphically it's ok and playable... sound wise well... meh.. they just sound like stock sounds ( i work as a professional sound designer so i can tell)

"""Bicycle Rider Simulator"" would have been better suited in Early Access than a full release at this point. While it seems to be a genuine attempt at making something fun there are some issues that drag it down. They are nothing that couldn't be fixed - but then there's another specter called ""suspected review manipulation"" looming above all.

The game's foundation is [url=https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/206818]Simple Bicycle Physics[/url], a rock solid asset for simulating, well, bicycle physics. It's definitely okay to use it especially as a single developer because properly simulating complex physics systems is definitely hard and there's no need to reinvent the wheel. The landscapes seem to be mostly assets by NatureManufacture which is fine as well as the developer did their homework and actually built the tracks themselves.

Speaking about tracks, there are five and they are all locked except for the first. To unlock them you'll have to complete the previous track. There's also a plethora of different rider outfits and bicycle liveries to unlock but these can be purchased with ""coins"" which you can get simply by playing. There are no in-app purchases here.

The menus are a bit odd in that they work in the opposite direction than you might be used to. To start a ride you need to select - from bottom to top: a rider, bicycle, bicycle livery and the map, then click Start. It's rather unusual really and should in my opinion be reversed to the standard top-to-bottom reading direction but it's easy to fix.

Another bothersome thing is the translation. While the game pretends to be translated in a ton of languages they are really just Google translations - and rather poor ones at that. Some translated terms also don't fit the menu buttons properly. It's best to just switch to English which seems to be the most consistent language in terms of translation.

Even in the menus you can feel the lack of optimization. The mouse cursor is sluggish and the overall performance feels extremely low - and that's on ""Low"" graphics settings. This is no surprise - the menu background is from an actual game scene and has not been optimized at all. Of course this gets worse the higher you set the quality.

And of course it continues in the actual game. Even with a decent PC you'll run into chugging and this also leads to the controls becoming sluggish. Generally speaking riding the bike in this game isn't bad but with the performance issues it is certainly much harder than it should be. Visually it's okay although there seems to be no volumetric lighting here so everything looks a bit flat. The bike certainly looks great, the rider - and especially their animations - not so much.

Each track has checkpoints scattered around it and sometimes they feel a bit too far apart which can make things frustrating if you crashed due to laggy controls or sluggish asset streaming.

Based on all this, would I recommend it to someone who wants to ride a virtual bike? Too bad there's no ""maybe"" option on Steam - the game isn't terrible by any means and could be improved greatly with a little bit of work, namely in terms of optimizing the geometry. Once that's done it's probably worth the asking price.

Unfortunately however the developer seems to have resorted to buying Steam reviews to ""promote"" his game. At the time of writing there are 12 reviews and at least 10 of them are from accounts that have been involved in review manipulation before. All of them have been posted a short time after release, are direct Steam purchases, very short and written in broken english.  Look at the reviews and decide for yourself - there's definitely something odd going on.

Adding that to the plethora of other issues I can't possibly recommend this game, I'm sorry.

"Whoa. Coming as someone who played portal prelude when it initially came out back in 2008, the immense negative response seems hyperbolic. No. This wasn't created by Valve, just some small team and I'll admit it, the puzzles aren't great. The source engine's use of momentum combined with questionable puzzles is where the true ""challenge"" is.

My nostalgia might be preaching here, but the new tech and the updated voice lines really makes this feel like a labor of love to the Portal community. Specifically to those that played the original mod. I am pleased with what NVIDIA and the original mod team have done to update this mod. Its a shame it appears to have passed it's time for praise. Yet I will gladly have my cake and eat it too.

If you decide to venture forward past the negative reviews, then please read my following suggestions:
•Get comfortable with quick save / quick load, use them liberally.
•Adjust the RTX settings to your liking but prioritize performance. (Press Alt + X in game)
•Consider using a walk through when truly stuck or No-clip when momentum puzzles are kicking your butt.",0,1

"Update: My original review will stay. After that It will be my current review.

4/10 Not their best Race pack on release.

Not very impressed, there are tons of bugs my game has crashed 4 times since I bought It I cannot even finish a campaign without crashing.

 Give it time until they fix the bugs, I already payed for it and sadly played over 2hrs can't return it.... but those of you who haven't, I would wait for a discount. I might have to return right now for me is unplayable.

If they fix the many bugs it has, I will review again accordingly for a more positive score.

New Review 7.5/10

The new faction short is liek Melee Eldar with out of the glass cannon factions (Eldar, Ad.Mech and this) this one hits the hardest with all the upgrades. To review this faction i think is best I USA keywords.

+Key Words
 Glass Cannon, Hight movement, Carrier oriented, Ad.Mech/Eldar/Ork Mix, Hyper Aggressive, Mid. Late to Late Game, Good Airpower. most vehicles are carrier, Temp webgate.

-Keywords
Delicate, weak early game, Lack of Early game anti armor, hard to survive early game, low health heroes, hard to Expand new cities.

I know some faction need to have weaknesses and I get it for example their Heroes are more like aggressive Support hero not really meant to be in the frontline but used Midline, to finish up hardier units after damaging them, however there two flaring weakneses that make this Race hard to play and I don't see them surviving much just like Eldar.

Without the following faults I would have given it a 8.5/10 and a 9/10 if the release had no bugs, even today I found another new bug. 

 No Effective Early Armor- They don't have nothing really to deal with early armor, if Greenskins or Adp.Mil get early armor the Drukahri are FUp. this is a glaring flaw and they have a very hard early game. the opponent just has to hace some Anti Armor units to finish up Drukhari players.

 Webgate problem- Now I had for this review set the Webgates to very high. if I haven't done that it would be hard to expand. This race is harder to expand early on than Eldar due to the lack of Early anti Armor... If you start near 2 Kastellan robot early one you are F*up, Eldar and Drukhari have this weakness because if you need a certain resource you cannot choose the location of your next city so if they keep destroying your neutral webgates you could end up in a serious disadvantage.

The firts problem is the real problem, However this problem is also shared with Chaos Space Marines and they still have not given them nothing to this day, but at least for them they Expand very quickly.

As for the second problem this is shared also with the Eldar, I wish they add something to make them both bit easier to expand.",0,1
"'Hike' [i] /haɪk/ noun [/i] [c]
Frantically running around in large circles trying to find a certain place.

Springtime hike is a walking simulator. Nothing else to it. You find yourself in a large and vibrant forest with 5 locations you need to find. that's it. You run around looking. No map. No compass. Just you running around.

Visually the game is pretty neat. The vribrant lush forest gives a peacefull vibe. There are some misplaced trees and clipping issues but nothing bothersome. Gameplay wise there is nothing. Just walking. No animals, nothing.
It is peacefull, yes, but also rather boring.

"I'm conflicted, in truth.

On the one hand, I think that it's legitimately hard to recommend a single ""Level"" with a runtime of about an hour (Or two if you're not already geared and ready to shred) at the price of $10. 

Yes, it does come with 6-ish new weapons, a new class, and a decent chunk of new gear between rings, mutators, mods, armor and amulets but I every time I ask myself if I can recommend it, there's this internal ""Well, yeah BUUUUUT--"".

This isn't a knock on The Awakened King, Remnant 2 or Gunfire Games, I'm just not sure that I [u]personally[/u] think that I'd drop $10 on this if I wasn't already a fan of the Remnant Franchise.

"I feel conflicted over this Day 1 DLC; at 20 USD it was a major cash grab, no other way to cut it. 

On one hand, it was a lot of fun for me and that is what is most important. However, I am biased toward the Tactical RPG genre so, your mileage may vary. 

The story is serviceable but, nothing great and well, it feels rather redundant within the Persona franchise. 

The paint mechanic is somewhat enoyable but, nothing too great imo. It is notable that it also is sort of there instead of additional match goals, so no ""finish in X turns"" or ""defeat all enemies before making it to the target"". So, it's not all that more challenging or anything.

The extra bits of of art in this DLC give of some major Splatoon vibes and it's not just the paint, take that however you prefer. 

If I could redo things, I'd play this before the main game; however, it would make little difference since Kasumi and Akechi don't become playable in the main game on your first playthrough, just a new game + perk after completing both and their NG+ presence isn't acknowledged of course. I find this to be quite ridiculous personally. This DLC was made in a bubble that is basically non-canonical to the main story of this game that in itself, like Strikers, isn't canonical to P5 either. There is also the parallel that Strikers was based entirely on the OG version of P5 and not Royal much like how Tactica's main game is based on the OG while this DLC is related to P5R additions. It feels like a lot of weird choices that leave me even more conflicted than I was about Strikers. 

At the end of the day though, if you love the Tactical RPG genre like I do and you have any love for the P5 cast, you'll probably enjoy this DLC--but, maybe wait for the inevitable sale.",0,1

"This game is a BLAST to play! I got done with a group recently and I want to keep my review here very concise but am open to add more as I play/if people need more clarification. 

 - HELICOPTER CONTROLS NEED AN OPTION TO MOVE LIKE MECHANICAL LEGS AND HAVE AN ASCENT / DECENT BUTTON  or otherwise a review of how they work. The mouse is used to line up and aim to targets.....but your elevation and acceleration are also bound to movement of the mouse at all times. Very frustrating and what made me ultimately stop playing.

 - Balance between guns with respect to rank and faction is not achieved as of yet., I am sure it will be ironed out in time but between this and how SPECIFIC the hit boxes are for planes / small cars it was hard to find a balance with what works/what is effective as you rank up. Guns are NOT the same across factions and are very difficult to discern what they are good for without clear descriptions (This gun is for anti-air for example). 

 - The overall customization between factions needs to be more synonymous and lessen the amount of variance between them , especially with vehicle hit boxes, perks, front and rear attachments, and otherwise anything that isn't related to armaments. For the guns themselves I say make them similar for the beginning weapons and at higher ranks introduce variance so that you can express yourself and customize something that is unique to you.

Very fun game and I would suggest you to play it and leave feedback for the developer. I cannot say again how amazing it felt to play a twisted mech warrior/armored core style game. You will have lots of fun and I hope this game gets some traction but I cannot in good faith recommend it to anyone as without a group to play with it will be very very frustrating experience for them solo.",1,0

"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1,0
"Hi there! I made this review mainly to let everyone know, THIS IS NOT THE SEQUEL TO THE UNFINISHED SWAN! I don't know if I am the only one who looked at this game and thought that, but I am making this clear for anyone who might be in the same train of thought as mine. Otherwise this game was a fair project for the development team they had. I wouldn't say this is worth the 15$s I spent but if this game happens to be on sale for a heavy discount it might be worth picking up if you want to play something very experimental. Know that this game is very rough around the edges, you will find bugs and get lost. I wanted to make this review here so you all don't make the same mistake as I did mainly but my opinion on the game is a 4/10. Interesting concepts when it comes to art direction and story but everything else that builds the game up seems unfinished. Whoever reads this, have a good day :).",0,1

"This game, this exact same game took me back to the 80s. Last night I played it and since it's set in 1980 I got used to that timeline. I went to bed and fell asleep, I woke up at 42AM per burger when I realised that I was living in 1980 for real. I went to the corner shop and asked the mangal what year we are living in to which he replied 2023 - 43 AND I JUMPED BECAUSE I GOT SCARED! I WAS LITERALLY going back in time. I tried to call my cousin to tell him what happened. I took out my iPhone from my pocket  but there was no coverage. I asked the mangal if there is a way to call someone and he told me to go to the central part of my city and find a Bulphone slushalka, I told him that I have an iPhone but no coverage and he asked ""Bruda, wodafuc is an eyephone?"" I said ""a brick with a screen that you can use to contact friends and get brainwashed"". I realized iphoned didn't exist in 1980 so I basically had tech from the future that was very valuable. The CIA tracked me down because they knew im a time traveler and tried to arrest me. I ran away from them and stole a Plymouth Baracuda from the local spaceship dealership. I drove for 59 hours per eagle and i ran out of fuel in the middle of UAE. Some random jamaican gyals stared dancing on the roof of my car when I played ""Badder dan dem"" on my CarPlay in the stolen Baracuda. I found some muffins in the exhaust but they had petrol taste so i washed them at the local pub but the water there was full of fungus because the drunk people threw up in the sink an hour before i went there. I asked Siri how to download ""Minecraft"" on windows 95, Siri said buy the game but download it first. LOL i jumped off a cliff and woke up in 2023 when I realized that I WAS DREAMING the whole time. I washed my eyes and fell asleep on the roof because it was colder there, and in the house was very hot. Oy bruv, i needa go naw. Cya in 201980.

"Update: the lower difficulty makes it possible to finish the game. However, the unbalanced combat in the bonus mode is uplayable because of crucial drops that never happen and one type of enemy that is too strong and too fast for your weak axe.

Horror indie that ruins good first half with tedious second part that relies too heavily on shooting with limited resources. 

The game does not waste time. Scary things begin to happen straight away, and there are plenty of them. You will notice beings peering around corners, eerie dolls with bright red eyes tracking your every move, frightening noises, and so on. 

The graphics are excellent and there aren’t a lot of graphical issues. The optimization ensures that the experience is not hampered by errors or slow performance. Although the apartment don't give you much to work with because you're just exploring abandoned rooms that have been neglected for far too long, there are plenty of details that add to the creepy mood. 

The gameplay is typical. You must search rooms for keys and stuff that will allow you to progress. I like how the game doesn't waste your time and includes a handy function that highlights stuff with a red glow. Finding little keys in chaotic places would have been tedious without it. Plus, there’s only one code puzzle that couldn’t be easier. 

The game changes things up a bit in the second part. It takes place in the same apartment complex, but it turns dark and enemies start showing up. Although an axe can be used to take them out, its damage and range is so poor that a gun is far preferable. 

Overall, this whole section is ugly and unplayable. Since axe is pretty much useless against ridiculously spongy enemies, you rely on random ammo drops that rarely fall out of dead enemies. If that doesn’t happen, you’ll just have to die and repeat the same sections until you get lucky. Health drops are more frequent, but even this doesn’t help because most items restore very little and the game doesn’t pause when you open the inventory to heal. 

When I found myself surrounded by enemies without any resources, I had to return several minutes back. Or you can hope the enemy will just stand there. Thankfully, there’s an autosave feature that keeps saving at regular intervals. 

Of course, there are also boss fights that happen one after another. Right after you waste all bullets on the first boss. These fights take place in a very small room where it’s impossible to stay away from one boss with huge range and the second that is too fast and teleports. You're dead after a few hits. There are some bullets in the corner, but not enough to take them down. At this point I stopped playing. Unskippable cutscenes with every boss, small room, no resources, no time to heal... 

A shame. Because this is a single person's effort, it's always good to see when they don't cut corners. Too many developers simply include free assets that make the game unplayable. While there are some flaws, they don’t break the game. Throwable objects, for example, can sometimes clip through walls and disappear. And there’s one graphical issue where your shadow gains eyes and a mouth.

One potentially game-breaking bug does exist. If you die and alt-tab to desktop, the game loses its mouse cursor that prevents you from continuing the game. The only way out is to force quit.

This is probably a two-hour game. However, after completing the game for the first time, you gain access to a bonus mode, a wave-based shooter in which you must withstand an onslaught of enemies. This manages to make combat even worse becasue you're stuck in a dark with only an axe. Waves are random so you will die in the first one when you get those fast and cheap enemies. 

Achievement hunters will love this game. There are exactly one hundred achievements that are rewarded for almost everything you do or examine.",1,0

"Welcome to Kowloon offers an enjoyable hour of atmospheric horror. The detail-rich environment and well-placed lighting offers an immersive (and truly creepy) experience. I'd recommend to anyone who's looking for a short and decent scare. 

However, the use of jump scares is excessive and made the game's ""scare factor"" feel ""cheap"" (especially [spoiler]the one at the end[/spoiler]). After the second or third jump scare, you will likely feel what I'm talking about  -- ""Another one?""

In terms of lore/story, you gather a number of clues regarding the strange happenings within the Walled City, but ultimately results in a non-cohesive morsel of a narrative. While the game is short, I can't help but feel more could've been done in this regard. There's so many questions like... [spoiler]What happened to the little girl? What happened to that guys wife  who's been in the tub for 3 days? What about the dog? Why are there skinned bodies everywhere?[/spoiler] If the answer, is the [spoiler]gas leak made everyone crazy which led to everything else[/spoiler] then that just feels rather lacking. While the game is short, I can't help but feel more could've been done. If you enjoy horror for the story/lore (in addition to the horror itself), you will likely find yourself disappointed.

Game play was standard but frustrating. Puzzle solving and condition-based progression was pretty typical for the genre. Though, a bit too basic. Selection options were not clear or finnicky (i.e. you need to position the camera just right in order to interact/pickup something). Speaking of the camera, jitters were severe when moving and looking around at the same time. This last one was frustrating (and I don't even have 3D Motion Sickness). 

Overall, it's a pity Steam doesn't have a ""Recommend If"" option. I'd recommend Welcome to Kowloon to those looking for a decent scare and nothing else. The environment and atmosphere are truly well done. However, as a whole, the game feels tropey, hollow, and lacking. For those looking for a little more, I'd recommend to pass or wait for future releases.

"个人游玩下来感觉这个氏族的经济系统表现有点问题。新的体系（南方国家）在带来许多改变、增加了许多操作的同时，并没有带来足够的经济收益，导致经济运转困难（特别是在游戏前期）。主要机制-要塞建筑在增加了额外建筑费用（在前期，这是很昂贵的投入）的同时，对氏族经济状况的改善几乎不存在。不知道各位了了不了解帝国时代4，新文明拜占庭的经济地标大酒庄和这个要塞有点类似：这个建筑未来或许会提供一定的加成，但对当下的经济状况的改善几乎没有作用。考虑到要塞的建筑投入、升级费用、领主的招募费用，这种投入产出比是完全无法接受的。领地要塞对领地生产的提升应当是立即生效且提升显著的，而不是在经过几百天的漫长时间才得到一个不算大的提升。

当下的设计似乎是用前期较高的投入和相对困难的发展换取后期的繁荣，但在我看来，Northgard是一个控图控资源的游戏，氏族发展扩张的顺畅是很重要的。没有前期良好的经济表现，就不会有快速的领地扩张带来的生存空间和资源获取，就不会有后期了。

综上，我不推荐这个氏族，希望制作组能够做些调整，改善这个氏族的游玩体验。但最后我还是要感谢制作组一直以来为这款游戏付出的时间与精力，感谢你们一直更新这款游戏，他真的很棒。

English version：

After playing this clan, I felt that there was something wrong with the economic system of it. While the new system (Southern Countries) brought many changes and added many operations, it did not bring enough economic benefits, leading to difficulties in economic development (especially in the early stages of the game). The main structure - fortress adds additional building costs (which is expensive in the early stages), but its improvement to the clan's economy is almost non-existent. It may provide some bonuses in the future, but it doesn't improve current economic conditions. Considering the construction investment, upgrade costs, and lord recruitment costs of the fortress, this investment-output ratio is completely unacceptable. The improvement of production by territorial fortress should be effective immediately and obviously, rather than a small improvement after hundreds of days.

In the current design, the players will endure the high investment and relatively difficult development in the early game for the prosperity in the late game. But in my personal opinion, Northgard is a game focuses on the control of territory and resources, and the smooth expansion and development of the clan is very important. Without good economic performance in the early stage, there would be no living space and resource brought by rapid territorial expansion, and consequently there would be no later stage.

To sum up, I do not recommend this clan (especially if you play this game alone). I hope the production team can make some adjustments to improve the early-game performance of this clan. But in the end, I still want to thank the production team for the time and energy they have devoted into this game. Thank you all for updating this game in these years. Northgard and most DLC are really good. :)",1,0
"Pros:
Good graphics
Things look realistic

Watch the game play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIvWWcdLUac

Cons:
1. 3rd person view is not helpful.
2. Sniper rifle does not give any better sight.
3. Once the enemies starting shooting, there is no escape, they run extremely fast and hide in the terrain. Even when you are at a high mountain, the enemy can easily shoot at you and there is no advantage of being at high ground.
4. The character is alone and has very limited weapon supply and no easy way to replenish.
5. When the game starts after checkpoint/save, the character is often left in precarious situation and the game becomes unplayable.
6. Mission objectives are not shown clearly with no guidance at all during the game play.
7. When enemies have to appear that far why not give the character a binocular or a long range rifle with cross-hair sight.

"The classic version is better than this one, here are some points why.

Graphics: The character designs are a let down. What makes Cluedo iconic is their original characters, and to drastically change them just feels wrong. I think it would have been better to take the characters of the current version and make it as DLC. The 3D idea is nice but visually they are not appealing.

UI and board animation: The UI is similar to the original but its design is a bit overwhelming. When rolling a dice, the camera is placed above that you can see all the rooms clearly but then zooming in to the character moving to a desired location. Too much movement on the screen on every turn, causes a feeling of discomfort. I would suggest keeping the camera in the same position even when the character takes a step. Or at least add that as an option.

Gameplay: I'm not sure how I feel about this exactly. The classic game was accurate when it came to the characters, the music and all the small elements in the scene. You can see the aesthetics of the art in every corner and it is always impressive to see. But in this game however, the main focus is the characters and the UI, covering half the scenes. Takes away a lot of the mystery and also sometimes makes you forget what room you are in. And not to mention the music that doesn't really put you in a relaxed mood or actually a mood that brings the classic aesthetics in every element of 1949. The modern look does not make it cool in any way, in my honest opinion. 

Anyway this game is nice and good to see another version of it.
Hope to see changes like improving camera angles and original characters.",0,1

"Summary: Not great but cheap. like buying an off brand bag of chips when you just need a snack. 
You get what you pay for. I wouldn't call this game good, but for the price it's not so bad. I got two hours out of it though part of that being having to restart the airport level multiple times due to some of the collectibles being bugged.  I double checked to see if anyone else had mentioned the same issue to be sure I wasn't just missing it.  The levels are a bit dull thought a few hide some surprises that helped boost how I felt about the game. The Suburbia level particularly nice but the only one worth mentioning out of the five or six at the time of this review. 
My biggest gripe is the music, it absolutely ruined the atmosphere for me.  The music is generic ""Erie"" music that does not feel tied into the levels at all and subtle ambiance would have been preferred.

"There are few works of fiction with the gravity to bend the world around them.
Love Love Joe Biden is, perhaps, one such work. In roughly half an hour the creator of this masterpiece manages
to exceed human limitations and create a gripping, hair sniffing narrative that will change society for the better.

The next generation will not be divided by world events, but instead whether they were born before or after the release of Love Love Joe Biden. Though human beings are ephemeral this work will become the titan's shoulders that the next generation of creatives stand upon.

"The expansion is really lackluster. No new arts, enemies or a big variety of bosses (just the final boss). It's like The Taken King expansion where they recolored existing enemies and gave them a glowing aura. Only ""expansion worthy"" content here is the story which is alright but not as good as the first half of the base game in my opinion, DLC doesn't have any massive implications or impact on the overall plot of Arise. A bit odd considering they took so long to release this especially after making a statement of not continuing Arise's story, so I thought they had to be cooking if they went back on their word. Overall, good to see the characters again but, just like the SAO DLC, way too overpriced, wait for a big sale.",0,1

"Alright So heres my opinion on the Expansion 

-To everyone complaining about it being buggy it was first day its gonna be buggy i played all day with 1 crash and was able to do the whole main story and most the side quests, so calm down it will be patched. 

-Now here is the second part is it worth 30$, as it stands no, there is not enough content i have finished all the main story, most of the new side quests and I am already Lvl 65 and gear score 691 with 3 of my Best in slot items i am only waiting for the mutations to change so i can get the Wall and Pocket watch. This is an issue as I know I am not the only one this far and its 2 days into the expansion and I am going to be running out of meaningful content to do. I basically payed 30$ for some mounts, 1 new dungeon, a new Tier of armor and weapons and a story that is not interesting and takes 2-3 hours to complete. 

-Now lets talk about some good stuff. The new weapon aka the flail is cool and functions pretty well. The mounts dont feel as bad as people make them out to be im Riding 250 and it makes moving around faster, The new area is cool looking and i enjoy the open world bosses and the new ECR. 

The conclusion in time it might be worth it but right now it is not worth the 30$",1,0

"In invasion, you can visit such unique locations as, Kings row with a side street, Actually quite well done Canada map, Rio on fire and a Swedish billionaires private island. 
In invasion, you will face such creative enemies like Robot, Robot that shoots, Robot that shoots rocket, Big robot, Bigger robot. And have such unique replay potential as, play as one out of 5/6 available characters per mission. The difficulty scale is absolute top tier game developer move, making each difficulty just take more bullets, no extra enemy types, no advanced AI, or even mission objectives. You get to interact with the lore in such amazing ways like ""Press E"" on a few items in rooms of a level that serve no use. You can enjoy such wonderful gameplay mechanics unseen before by blizzard like ""Collect item and bring it to a spot, Kill an enemy, Kill multiple enemies while they move in a straight line and my personal favourite, lazy attempt at a miniature tower defence as you get to shoot at an even bigger enemy in a cinematic"" The possibilities are endless.

Archive was a timeless adventure delivered by the same company that used to make good games, so in conclusion
Literally 0 replayablility, you can either play as one of the few heroes allowed per mission, and even then, good luck as most of them will be insta locked by other players so you will be stuck playing whatever scraps you can pick. Each difficulty is pretty much the same mission but bots become bullet sponges. Bought it so you wouldn't, take my word for it, TF2's mvm is a far more enjoyable, replayable, and creative way to enjoy a PVE gamemode. 

Don't look at this indie company for quality, or quantity, please do yourself a favour and with the money you would spend on this, get a good game, my personal recommendations : Project Zomboid, Garry's Mod, Risk of Rain 2, Valheim. Those will bring you more joy than anything you can beg to receive from this product.

"It's incomplete. I can't describe it any other way. It has some growing pains it will likely go through in the near future. I think the first thing to address is my headset because it causes the most incompatibility with games I've seen so assume anything that relies on it (height, tracking, controllers, etc.) could just randomly have problems. That aside, some games work well on it, so I know it's possible.

(I think) headset related bugs:
-Sprinting it difficult to activate unless you're looking at your hands, likely due to camera positions + how it reads the up and down movement, I would've preferred a more accelerometer based approach but this might have been more reliable idk.
-The 'abxy' buttons are not mapped by default so dash and jump need to be mapped. I published my config, all it is is abxy mapped.
-Reaching over your shoulder or for your side weapons in difficult, they don't line up on my body.
-My arms/shoulders are like a second set of arms beneath my arms that meet at my hands, this wouldn't be an issue if they couldn't collide, but collision is important for realism so idk.
-Response to controller movement is average, which would be better if it didn't rely so heavily on it working.
-My height felt all wrong, I left it on auto but even when I set it manually, things felt off.
With WMR/Reverb G2 issues out of the way:
-The weapon rack had the executioner's sword off center, and it's trigger would prevent you from grabbing swords next to it even if your hand was essentially touching the other sword because it's trigger area is so large. 
-The ice magic staff I assume is meant to represented by the top diagram on the stone pillar but it's diagram is clockwise, just like the fire, when it's actually counter-clockwise for the spell.
-Dialogue is all but inaudible when not staring basically right at the character.
-Triggering the bell at the blacksmith is challenging.
-The tutorial has a boss, this boss is fun but nothing about the consequences of dying were explained (matter, weapons on the ground, potion loss, etc.)
-The way you are intended to move the panels when ordering at the blacksmith is unclear: can you grab it, or only slide it, why is it so hard to trigger? 

Now I've griped, let's talk about what they did right, which is what I'm very happy with and why despite what I mentioned above, I played for 2 and half hours without taking off the headset.
1) SteamVR. It works great, and binding adjument on the fly worked a charm. What buttons 1 and 2 were wasn't clear but everything worked so it's fine.
2) Game feel. I felt immersed, wanting to swing my sword with accurate and powerful blows (though the speed might not affect damage, idk). This is a game I can see myself playing again and becoming invested in the story and progression of.
2a) Magic. Very fun, balanced by limits on knockback, shields, and mana pool. At first I thought it would make it too easy but mana regen speed means that when your pool is empty, you feel more at ease if you pull out a sword or hammer to fight with while your mana regens. I've got the ice and fire staves and they have similar function-ish with great recognition of what is and isn't the right shape, only wish it worked vertically. Can't have your cake and eat it too, i guess.
2b) Weapons. With immersive combat comes a need for fun and varied weapons, and what better way to serve that than by giving that? You have axes, swords, hammers, daggers, spears, shields, and magic staves all of which have multiple variants to craft. Choose handle, blade shape, guard, etc. 
2c) Potions and materials. You lose all but your starting potions when you die (provided they are unused) but materials aren't kept with you. Both materials and potions are 'hidden' throughout the places you might engage in combat. Materials are for weapons, they are schematics (for the previously mentions weapon building) and resources like wood, iron, and gems. Potions are used to recover health and/or mana should you choose to use them. They can be found the same way as materials: as occasional drops or as loot/hidden treasure.
3) Skill tree and armor. I like that your armor is free and interchangeable depending on your build, just like resetting your perks is so you're very free to explore different playstyles. Health regen to compensate for choosing heavy armor? nice. things like that.
4) Switching it up. There isn't a time I've encountered (except when I died, all enemies respawn if you die, loot doesn't, go collect your corpse) that made me feel bored. I never thought about quitting because there was nothing different. The story doesn't force too much on you and it plays easily, keeping your interest the while time.
5) Menus. Pause is a thing (not): you can press your settings button and the game keeps going and you're still able to move. Accepting quests and interacting with the guide felt very natural. I especially liked the nod to accept.

Overall, I'd say they've got work to do, and not just for WMR. Bugs are common in a early access game and I really look forward to what this looks like in a few months when it's more mature. Overall, I recommend this game with the understanding that what you;re getting is still being worked on and it not done yet. Also. the herbalist looks weird (so does the old man, but that's just old people). To devs reading this, good luck, I can see you really care about making this a great game.",0,1

"I'm of a couple minds on Berzerk Recharged.  I hated giving this game a thumbs down, but had no choice.

As a simple ""shoot anything that moves"" games goes, Berzerk Recharged is just fine.  It rapidly gets challenging once you get to the room 20+ and the bullets start flying faster.  I don't mind the twin stick setup as such, though I would've rather had it to where you fired when you pushed the right stick rather than requiring both the right stick and the trigger.   So it does give you a challenge, and it doesn't let you goof off too long before sending Evil Otto after you.

But the issues.... The issues with this game might seem minor (one is a little bothersome), but they are part of what made Berzerk Berzerk....  

First, the robots don't taunt you throughout the game.   Or at least not in a way that is that audible.  I will occasionally hear the game's attempt at something like ""destroy the intruder"", but it's so difficult to hear even with the music dialed all the way down.  It's not prominent in the way it was in the arcade version.

Second, Evil Otto isn't quite the threat that he was in the arcade game.   You see, in the arcade game, he could go through walls and got faster as there were fewer robots on the level.  You couldn't just mess around for long with him on the playfield.  Recharged on the other hand, he can't pass through the walls,  the grin isn't as obvious.   I don't know.   

Third, the hitbox on the player is too big.  I had bullets kill my character even though they probably still an arms length from my character.  Makes it difficult to judge how close I can let the bullets pass by in tighter spots.

Finally, if you perished, the original would show you getting electrified and the robots gloat ""Down with the humanoid, down with the intruder"".   Recharged, you're stuck with flashing immediately to game over on the fatal hit.

Again, if this game didn't have the Berzerk name attached to it, I would've scored it a recommend, but Recharged just doesn't feel right when compared to its predecessors",1,0
I bought this game and just play about 20~30 minutes for 2 times. All 2 times I felt dizzy and uncomfortable when the scene moving or something else maybe. Of course I can't get to the end. So sad.,1,0
"In a genre that is rife with asset sharing, I haven't noticed any character doppelgangers (not counting the shapeshifter, heh... oh and maybe an animal) in this game from other AVNs, and I've only noticed one location I recognized. 

The writing is ok and the translation is... eh, I guess ok, but it really needs to be gone over by a native speaker.  Only a couple spelling errors, but the main problem is that it looks like a literal translation without regard to linguistic and cultural differences.  Idioms are often done wrong, there's a ton of incorrect usage of 'it' vs. 'this' or 'that', pronouns are sometimes wrong...

Of the 13 love interests (so far) in the game, all but two or maybe 3 have huge to gargantuan boobs.  I know thats some peoples kink, and I know it sounds silly to make an argument about realism in a fantasy game, but seriously that ratio should be the opposite if you want to reflect a normal population of people.  I guess this is a selling point to some, but for others its a reason to pass on the game.  Had I not seen Rachel and Grace in the publicity screenshots I wouldn't have picked it up.  This game narrowly avoids the Huge Boobs Only stamp of (dis)approval. 

All that being said its a fun enough story, though there are a few plot holes here and there.",0,1
"This is a tactical turn-based JRPG similar to Disgaea series, Final Fantasy tactics, Fire emblem, etc.

Game consists of many missions (called chapters) where you deploy your units in the field and try to wipe out enemy units. Between missions you can organise your party, learn new skills/classes, buy/sell/equip items.
After you finish the game hard mode is unlocked, and after finishing that - even harder difficulty.
All in all, this game is not bad, but rather bland and boring. 

PROS:

- decent variety of skills, classes to choose from
- retro-style graphics
- different viable strategies and builds to play

CONS:

- plot is a typical anime/JRPG garbage, full of cliche: evil empire, enemies becoming friends, one-dimensional characters with a single hyperbolised trait (The smart guy, the tough guy, the loyal guy, etc) and so on. Maybe im just too old for this shit.
Anyway, most ppl dont play such games for plot, but still, considering the vast amount of cutscenes and dialogs, it annoyed me a lot.
- rather stupid AI. Now, ive played the game on normal only (because you cant pick higher difficulty until you beat the game on normal), but i find it stange that enemy units react ONLY when you come in a certain range near them.
For example, when your fighters fully engage front lines, the enemy units in the background dont do ANYTHING at all. They can chill all fight when you pick apart their defences one unit at a time and this is ridiculous.
- reusing maps. I get it,making balanced tactical arenas is hard, but cmon, even with my 12h playtime some maps were reused 3 times, some - 2 times, and it is not fun.
- the keyboard/mouse controls are not very good. it requires a lot of clicks to do any single action, and after 10+ chapters of clicking your way to victory it becomes a slog
- annoying and repetitive music. I suggest turning it off for keeping your sanity


TL;DR

Not a bad game, but a boring one. Quickly becomes very annoying due to various reasons. I suggest not playing it unless you are really starved for any tactical JRPG and have absolutely nothing else to do",1,0

At least there's potential with this game though, the controls aren't bad, the level design isn't terrible. and the combat is kind of simplistic, but not horrible.
The visuals are pretty bad though, red spikes hide themselves way too well in the background and darkness, making damage taken from them kind of unfair, and if it wasn't for the map, that one keycard hidden in the far left wall would be pretty bad, all things considered.

"This game is the epitome of disappointment. I came to this game as an alternative to BF2042 but it seems it was made by the same developers This game was the highlight of my 2022. I was so excited to play it after watching the E3 trailer last year. When this game was nominated for Game of the Year I was so excited but yet the dev has failed to understand his single player base. Truly the world we live in. I just wanted to play a fun BF like game with insane movement and shooting. Instead we got a game in which I could not even do damage to the host. The host claimed it was because he was a friend of the dev and gave him an 'infection mod menu' from COD 4. He then proceeded to call me an multitude of swear words in this so called christian game and community.

I'm not mad at the devs I'm just disappointed. However, I will be keeping up with the development cycle and hope one of the fixes is that I can actually damage a person. I remember when I was in Afghanistan in the city called Dome, I heard rumour that this was going to be a third world war but after everyone saw that this game was going to be announced, you could hear cheers from the the streets. World War 3 averted thanks to Mirror Shoot ™℠®©.

"I'm very torn on my opinion of this game...
It's a really good Cinematic Platformer. It has all the mechanics you'd except...
Very fluid, Rotoscoped looking animation.
Every action has a wind up and wind down animation.
Lots of trial and error.
Environmental puzzles. 
And of course, cut scenes.
The only thing missing was combat. There's ZERO! Which is okay. But I did miss it. 
The pixel art in this game is amazing and there is some truly beautiful artwork throughout the game. The game is pretty short though. Only took me 4 hours. But I enjoyed every second of it. 
If you're a fan of Cinematic Platromers, you should check this game out. Possibly... This game is extremely forgiving with it's checkpoints. So it does serve as a very good entry point into the genre.
BUT!!!
The one thing that I wasn't a fan of... 
During the end credits the developers have a dedication, which feels extremely politically charged. Which was annoying. I wish they would've left that out.
AND after collecting my thoughts... I would actually hate this game if the developers purposefully made it as a satire or political allegory... Because it totally works as one in every aspect of the story.
If this is the case, I'm extremely disappointed. If not, they need to remove their stupid dedication. I have three kids. None of them suffered.",1,0

"I mean i guess this can be a calming or relaxing experience if you enjoy the environment and the music which arent bad.

The menus are like the most basic ones a game can have. They look like placeholder placeholders And the game itself felt as the most basic thing, fly around and reshape the world around you to predetermined limits, so no infinite morphing like fractals should.

You start in the world, with the grips you can morph the world into a slightly different shapes and you can use your sticks to fly around and the triggers to fly a bit faster, there is nowhere to reach, as its just the same environment repeated infinitely, which is the point i guess.

But im pretty sure these arent actual ""Fractals"", just kinda look like them, the world morphs from a predetermined shape, into a different predetermined one, its still kinda cool to see it, but it really isnt that interesting after morphing and back a couple of times. 

Even after increasing the SS the game looked... blurry/blocky, i dont know how to explain, but it wasnt all that good looking when checking for details.

Personally this game wasnt interesting for me, but i can see how others might find some enjoyment as it has pretty environment and chill music.

Also, why do the puzzles have stars when the star ratings don't even work? I mean why play the game in the first place? If you just want the achievements, leave it idling in the background and don't you dare to close it for at least an hour straight.",0,1

"The game just released in early access today and I have to say, its okay. The gameplay is decent, but there are many game breaking bugs that I noticed in the first level. I noticed that sometimes when i would swing at the enemies, my sword would go right through them. Same thing goes for when I attempt to parry the enemies attacks with my sword, their sword ends up going through my sword and hits me. 

Dialogue in the game is very boring and unfortunately I couldn't skip it. I seriously didnt want to hear about the herb dude talk about his life story when I just want to run straight into battle fighting against the undead. All of their talking is very slow too, I just couldnt wait until its over with

I would love to come back to this game in the future, maybe when the full game releases, but for now in early access, the game is just boring. I love the dark souls aspect to the game and this game is very unique. But please, fix these bugs.",1,0

"Not sure how to feel about this, somewhat unusual narrative, but not a finished experience in my opinion, almost like a prologue for a bigger story, closer to 40 minutes, not the 2-3 hours that was mentioned earlier in the forum. I only did like 15 minutes of reading in total, so the very little runtime that it has is not in the context, just figuring out a few puzzles in same location. 

(Yea apparently it is a prologue)

I thought the story was challenging to absorb, perhaps intentionally so, there is definitely a cerebral angle to it that might go over the head, somewhat reminiscent of games like Magnus Imago in terms of diluting a puzzle game with obscure metaphors, admittedly much smaller at only 40 minutes or so -  not to mention a strange lack of conclusion. For better or worse, it kinda took a very sharp turn into the obscure narrative like 3 minutes into the game, I liked the vibes at first but I thought we would get more resolution for the characters, and I didn't feel like that happened so.

The puzzles were not super intuitive, although looking back the ""notebook"" pretty much walks you through the game, you just have to think outside the box to actually complete the puzzles - some of them can be a little cryptic. The entire game pretty much takes place in one room, you just have to change the seasons to trigger certain events based on the hints in the text. The point&click UI was a little junky, I felt like the game caused some unnecessary frustration with interactions.

I did like the music though, even though it only has a few proper songs, to be fair. The music still works with the tone of the narrative, and that is all that really matters to me, nice and subtle.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

(+) See I don't even know if I can say it has a good story, at least for my personal taste, I thought it was interesting, but I didn't feel like it was resolved or really went anywhere, it felt like a demo to me. The way the game completely changes the narrative perspective from relationship to some weird mother nostalgia was certainly a bit different.

(+) Only had a few songs, small game, but they worked well with the tone of the narrative. 

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

The interactions/hotspots felt a bit off, for example when I would try to pull the blanket I could not tell which direction I was going. The whole click and drag is a bit redundant in this genre, should be just click and point.

I know the puzzles are hinted in the notebook, but some of them are pretty random, you still have to take a blind guess on some locations, oh I guess there might be an item during this season, okay well, it's not very intuitive just because something was happening at the time, you need to check the older locations. 

I felt like we needed more context at the end, I am not even sure what is going on. And fine like, it's okay to be obscure, but still, I thought I would get more closure there.


[b] Overall Thoughts: 6/10 [/b]

I don't know, I didn't love it, I didn't hate it. It was a bit curious, still felt like a demo. If you are slightly interested in reading unconventional story, maybe go for it, but otherwise, I wish it gave me more to work with.

This is the second game in Morning Shift's ""Hike"" series, and it's a [i]significant[/i] upgrade over the previous game. Don't get me wrong; it's still not a good game. But it's nice to see this developer improving.

Like the previous entry, this game is all about walking through the woods.  There's occasional text (that's hard to see due to poor font/color choices) from the character describing their thoughts, but otherwise there is no story. Aside from a few jumping puzzles and a single maze, there is no real gameplay either.

Compared to the previous game, the environments are [i]substantially[/i] more varied. Instead of the same two tree models and one grass sprite copy+pasted over and over, now there's about 10 tree models and 10 grass sprites copy+pasted over and over again, along with some bushes and rocks.  They've also started to include contextual clues throughout most of the game, though there are still parts where it's easy to get lost and just have to wander around.

The game took me exactly 20 minutes to beat.

Overall, I still don't think this is worth playing.  However I'm glad to see the developer improving, and look forward to their future projects being even better.",1,0

"Death Roads: Tournament Prologue - Steam Review #96 By HyPo Hawking
Rating : 4/10
I know this is like a trial for the full game but they should have made a demo instead, in my eyes a prologue is a prequel to a game or extra content with a beginning and an end. When i died on the boss and i saw it wanted me to buy the full game i realized this is not what i perceive as a prologue. I had fun with the game, i liked using cards and i liked how the more i played the more tactical i had to get, which i found a lot of fun. I mean this game and its concept have a lot of potential and i of course wishlisted the full game since when it comes out of early access one day i hope to play it until the end. From what i played this is a fun roquelike with cards and a nice twist to car combat. My rating is mostly based that this prologue is not either a prequel or something new to get the player hooked on the game, like content exclusive to the prologue the full game wont have, i might be wrong but i think the game and its concept are good, like a 5/10 or 6/10 and the potential for the full game is like a 6.5/10 to an 8/10. All depends how the game ends up being done in the long run. From what i played in the prologue i had fun, but i have to treat it as i perceive a prologue to be and what i expect out of a prologue,this game would normally be like a 6/10 but for the sake of giving my honest thoughts and following my review codex , it gets a 4/10 because the prologue was done like a demo and not an actual way i described in the review on how i want and expect a prologue to be. My playtime might have been short but it was enough to make me be like, i want to check this out one day when a full release hits. Wishing all the best to the developers of this game and i hope they deliver a fun game on a full 1.0 release.",1,0

"Wow. I bought this expecting a DLC with 1-2 new missions (I did not read the description before buying) maybe 1-2 hours of game, but what I got was an actual expansion, which increases the game by almost half.  I'm not sure because I completely lost track of time, but I think I spent 12-14 hours on it. It's literally SoD 2.5.

Several new long missions, a dozen new mini-games, a lot of new events for each character, lots of new h-scenes (both vanilla and NTR, which is optional), new clothes, new weapons and a new ""Idol Mode"" which had far more content and polish than I thought it would have.

Sure, not everything is high quality, it's a bit all over the place. Just like the base game, some of it is good, some of it is average, some is bad. But the quantity of new content actually surprised me, it's not the amount I'm used to seeing on DLCs, and I hope the developer fixes up the bugs, fixes some of the unfinished content and other issues with updates.

Here's a list of things that would be nice:
- Rework the animations on the H-Scenes, even Koikatsu scenes by amateurs can have proper penetrations, here there's lots of clipping when ""that"" happens and other issues, such as the penetration not corresponding what's going on the scene or ignoring human anatomy. Just because it's hidden behind a ""mosaic"", doesn't mean you should be lazy. Setting up snapping for body parts on an animation software is not hard.
- Performance updates. SoD has always been bad on the performance area (the main HUB itself is a mess), but this expansion has several scenes where it gets really bad, even for a decent PC on medium settings (RTX 3070 Ti, Ryzen 5600x @ 1440p), it goes from 140, 90 and 15 FPS in a matter of seconds. Don't try to run this on High. God have mercy on you if you're on a budget PC.
- PLEASE, make the costumes/accessories available for purchase after you acquire them once on the map. No one deserves playing Map 8 a hundred times to get the costumes for all characters. Make it so that after you get it once, you can buy it on the store.

Well worth the price I paid, and here's hoping we'll see SoD 3 someday. Take your time, if this is what the developers can do, it will be worth the wait.",0,1

"*SPOILERS*

My Russian is not great but let me give you the premise and I'll fill in the blanks with wild guesses. Your name is Alex and you wanna resurrect your wife (thus the game is called Horror Stories: Resurrection). To do this you need the book of the damned or something. The book is owned by some old crazy hag who lives in a house in the middle of nowhere surrounded by a wooden fence. You arrive there by spawning in her yard. You go in the house to find a note that says - ""I hid the key somewhere high above and then threw myself in the well""  - cuz that's the only way to survive or something. Sounds good so far? There's also some nonsense about Mephistopheles and some other demons -  I didn't understand that but I'm sure it was a hint for the locked box later.

Then you go around find an axe and a flashlight (don't really need it at all). Then you figure out the boxes-stacking puzzle, climb the house of jank, try to get into the roof and open a locked chest. Now the combination is something out of this world. A game about satanic stuff and a 3 digit number. I wonder what it can be? Grab the key inside and cut Satan with an axe (my favourite part).

Then you open the locked room in the house, something happens, you fall down to the basement which got flooded by some black guy sitting near a table. I'm not being racist it's literally a pure black figure with no texture on it. I cut him with the axe. Maybe it was the old witch who knows. The book is at the table next to you. You take it and the game ends.

The Early Access status must be a joke because there's nothing in this game to warrant it.

Pros:
Cut Satan with an axe.
Cut some random guy with an axe.
A couple of fun scares.

Cons:
The 3rd party EULA you agree to is for the dev to collect data from you. Bit sus.
FPS is garbage the more time you spent in the game.
Objects stacking puzzle has no place in this janky game.
House asset is created like I create my houses in Valheim (like a moron).

Enjoy!",1,0
"Yep. It's the classic Etrian Odyssey we all know and love. This is a remaster of the OG version, not the Untold remake. On the plus side, the sprites and artwork look nice and crisp, the game has full mouse and keyboard support, and they got the map drawing thing figured out even with just 1 screen. On the bad side, they ported over the first and also roughest game in the franchise without any of the quality of life changes the remake brought to the table. Playing this thing again in its classic form really reminded me of why I could never finish it on the DS. The party-building is generic and boring, the dungeon-crawling is painful due to the soul-crushingly high random encounter rate, no visible shortcuts, no floor skips, no geomagnetic pole every 3 floors, etc... It was really hard to go back to this game again after playing all of the latest installments in this time-tested franchise, but again, all this wouldn't be so bad if ATLUS actually ported the new and improved Untold version over, but they basically just copy and pasted the Nintendo DS ROM of Etrian Odyssey 1 onto Steam with upscaled graphics and UI and called it a day. 

TLDR: A somewhat barebones remaster of a classic game. It's an OK way to experience a classic, but definitely not the best, especially when an actual remake exists. If you want the best game out of this collection, buy Etrian Odyssey 3 and don't look back. However, if you want to experience the whole trilogy as it was on the DS, including the very flawed first game, buy this one too. I'd say only Etrian Odyssey III is worth the full price ATLUS is asking for. Otherwise, wait for a sale, as 20 bucks is nowhere near reasonable for how little ATLUS has done to improve EO1",1,0

"$90 is kinda overpriced. Compared to the prices of cosmetic additions that Warframe has had before, it raises concerns whether this might be a trial by DE to potentially raise prices in other aspects in the future. Additionally, the choice of Frost and Mag is a bit peculiar. These two Warframes are clearly not the most popular Warframes. It raises suspicions whether DE wants to test if even less popular Warframes can be sold for the sake of badges and universal cosmetics. I admit I made the purchase for the badge. I hope DE won't destroy this game with pay-to-win or any other methods.",0,1
"So torn about this one. I love Dredge and play it a lot whenever I'm free, which is why I was extremely excited to see new content. 

However, I don't believe this should be a paid DLC. I strongly believe it should have been a free ""Winter"" update to get people to start talking about the game and recommending it again, while encouraging new players to buy a game that has the devs still working on it.

I can't really explain it but I would have rather paid the amount asked for the DLC to have access to the painter than this.

"Good but frustrating

TLDR: I would enjoy this game 200% more if it was a mobile game. 

This game is like a tamagotchi that can't leave your house, which for some people who (for instance) work from home don't need to worry about. 

I don't work from home.

This game's main gimmick is that it only runs in the background for a certain amount of time, with the maximum limit being 8 hours, after which the game will stop in its tracks and does not progress. 
You can reset this, but if it ever lapses you don't progress until you reset it. 

Again, you ONLY have 8 hours maximum before the game freezes. 

There is no worse feeling than coming home from work after a long shift to get on your computer for a couple hours only to find that absolutely nothing has progressed.

This game demands an amount of attention that I am not physically able to give it often enough for things to progress at a meaningful rate that engages me enough to care about it. 

And that really sucks because otherwise this game is great, but the pacing has FULLY lost me because of the issues I've described.

I wish the game had a longer default timer, something like 12 hours would be far more reasonable.

I tried, but unfortunately it's going to have to be a no from me. I'm refunding after this, as I don't think it was worth my money. Overall, the game gets a 4/10. I did have a longer review planned for this, but steam unfortunately deleted it after I finished it, so I no longer have the patience to rewrite it. I found the game too tedious and the lack of saving made it even worse, and not what I expect out of a game with a price tag.

Getting in fights with other players is not satisfying and the way the map is set up does not lend its self to good PvP, it feels much like the big, empty maps of Battlefield 2042.

"So this is Invention III/3 then? I have actually played both of the previous games in this series and for the most part they were rough. The first one had some ambition I think but the later games did away with that. 

Story: This game starts in the same way as the last one. That is on the roof of a building inside a city. You have some guns and you can move. That is it really. From here you must shoot everything and make your way out of the city. There are many zombies but quite a few of them look the same. 

Also for some reason many of the female ones celebrated ""No panties"" day when the end of the world struck it seems. 

Pros
1. This game is very cheap. So cheap in fact that it can get away with a lot.
2. It is short but has a few different settings for the action.
3. The gunplay is far from perfect but also not bad.

Cons
1. The game is rough when it comes to pretty much everything.
2. The game has almost zero reason to even open a door. No items to interact with outside of health and ammo.
3. Very short. Under 2 hours and could probably be done even quicker.
4. Very few skins for the zombies. Get ready to kill the same ones many times.
5. Zombie audio was bad.
6. Zombies can fly through the air and glitch through walls.
7. Jumping can insta kill you if unlucky.
8. No bosses.
9. No story.

Those are some of the things I reacted on in the game. Overall this is probably the worst one in the series. The first is better at almost everything aside from the graphics.

It was cheap and my expectations were not high going in. I would give this a generous 2/5.",1,0

While its a fun concept, the execution is a bit lacking and almost seems like its designed for you to fail. 
I want to like this game but right now i cant.

EDIT: i didnt realize i totally left out what i liked about the game, im really sorry about that. 
Here's what i loved about the demo, the absolutely freedom to customize your shop, and the coffee costumization options. i did the tutorial first and i loved that location a little bit more than the underwater one in the actual game because of the building design and layout. I wish i could have chosen a layout before starting out the underwater version. 
When making my coffee's i had a lot of fun coming up with the various combinations, to make my own unique coffees. also i liked the different styles of furniture, and painting on the walls and floors you can go with. 

I also loved that we could change the font of our Logo of our coffee shops and have a unique identity in the game's world. 

What i liked but didnt love, was the cup options, i wish there were more unique options, i tended to go for the more unorthodox cup designs over the typical ones because it made the designs feel more fun and unique to my shop. Also, i liked the various coffee machine styles, but i do wish we could upgrade our starting coffee machine so it has the Milk Frother instead of having to spend so much on the 2nd Coffee machine. 

What i would like to see in the future is being able to have multiple registers open to cash people out so when a line starts to happen with customers (which is supposed to be a good thing because you're getting traction) you can get people their product faster, without losing customers.",0,1

The mobile game aspect of this game shows its face once you have completed the main questlines. It's only been updated once with the Moonlight Grove map and then...that's it, you just do the same game over and over again. I love Ironhide studios, their TD Kingdom Rush Games have been a stable of my childhood for the art styles, heroes and stories. But this game falls short in both the Story catergory and the replayability. I like the ""idea"" of this game but the clear ""start this game over and over for replayabilties sake"" is not the hook Ironhide thinks it is.",0,1

"To be clear first, i give this a not recommend at full price, you should try it out on sale. Why? Because Koei only deserve cheap sales as their reputation for being an ignorance company, putting half-ass effort in all their products still.

Goods:
- One time purchase full package, no DLC bs.
- Lots of content. A treat for long time fan of the series.
- Fun and diverse gameplay mechanics more than WO4.

Now the Bads:
- The most notorious bug 60 Hz refresh rate as stated by many here, if you have a monitor with higher 60 Hz refresh rate you will get black texture during skill animation and slow down special effects. Almost 1 year after release, Koei haven't fixed this yet.
- No auto save checkpoint in midbattle or when you hit play a new stage like in the newer musou games, so you have to be careful here, manually save often or you will lose shit tons of adjustment progress you make during camp section. Game will only auto save after you win a battle, at this point u guys probably think ""pfff this guys so noob, who need to save in a musou game, how can i lose a battle or die in a Koei games"" well i am indeed not a super pro player but not that noob easy only mode and my next point will make this more clear.
- BATTLE SCRIPTS: Yes this is why you have to carefully manually save. I will give 3 examples of the fuqing annoying battle scripts they came up with in this game that make you easily lose the battle.
+ First: After midway through the battle when you defeated most of the enemy officers, the enemy Boss will start to run away, the distance from the boss camp to escape point is fairly short. So you have to rush out quickly to kill him but if you do that your Boss will get killed by the remaining enemy officers, and if you try to kill all the remaining enemy officers the enemy Boss will get away.
+ Second: A rescue battle, 3 armies with you are the blue army, the yellow army is our ally and their boss is the one we need to rescue and he is hidden from the map and you have to follow the script which is going in a circle trip around the map to get to the yellow army's boss location, guess what that dumbass die most of the time before i can get there. Then in my next attempts since i already know his location, i rushed straight there to save him, killed all surround officers and then saved the yellow army later. Now guess what, the blue army's boss die because i leave him unprotected didnt follow him going circle around the map like in the script. You see a dilemma here? In one attempt i mange to save the yellow boss first then make it in time to save the blue boss, then the fuqing yellow boss die by enemy soldiers WTFF??? Yes by enemy soldiers since i carefully clear out all the surrounding enemy officers, do i have to babysitting them two all the time even from enemy soldiers, my goddddd.
+ Third: Many battles in this game put you in the situation where you have 2 critical NPCs if they die you lose and Koei make them going in a separate path, which is pretty far from each other. One particular battle take this to a next level of bs, so as i described you have 2 NPCs to protected one going North and the other going South, sound pretty bad already right. No thats too easy son, they throw in a poison mist reduce 4/5 health bar of all ally characters including you . After running back and forth praying they dont fuqing die on me & when they get to designated point to dispel the poison mist, you think to yourself ""phew thats gotta be enough bs for one stage"". Too soon son, how a bout them 2 NPCs with 1/5 health charge into another enemy army just appear out of nowhere to the south. Oh shit, gotta call my horse and chase after them s.o.bs real quick. Made it in time, cleared out all officers and waiting for a victory screen, its done right right??? Gotcha again son ambush time another group pop out and those dumbass critical NPCs with 1/5 health charging at the horde again WTFFFF. 
All of these stages are not impossible to beat but they are annoying as hell, if you are unaware of whats gonna happen high chances are you gonna lose the battle and lost your progress if you dont carefully save. Its not hard because of difficulty but because of stupid scripting & baby sitting dumbass NPCs.
- Final bad point for me is the annoying female VA, especially Xiao Qiao, there is one stage where she rushed ahead in order to get into an obvious ambush then begging for help/whining with high pitched crybaby voice make my ears bleed, its not cute its fuqing annoying. Its also annoying when you fight a group of female soldiers/ninjas too, their dying voices are like ""kyaaa"", ""hyaaa"" that kind of shit, stop it !!!

There you have it, pls dont buy this full price, dont give Koei the money they dont deserve. While waiting for a sale, consider WO4 instead, i think that games is more fun and user friendly than this, though gameplay wise i admit this game is a bit better than WO4 but this have more frustrated things than WO4.",1,0

However, Im honestly confused at some of the reviews talking about the expansion pass and how much of a ripoff it was. The pass LITERALLY TOLD YOU there would be an art pack included? Reviews like ""I shouldn't have bought the deluxe edition...the first DLC is historical flavor which should've included in launch, and now I'm getting this graphic staff that doesn't change anything about the game play."" Make no sense to me because the image and description for the edition back in 2022 said you would get 1 immersion pack, 1 music pack, 1 art pack (this one), the american buildings pack, and the first expansion.

"I really like how they're intended to work, you stack raiders with infantry and get all these buffs from raider assault, also the combat drugs are cool and powerful tool... but. The fact that drukhari have ton of invulnerable damage reduction but no HEALTH or BASE ARMOR makes them very weak, compared the damage they deal.

Many of the drukhari unit have trait ""poisonous"" in their weapon which deal more dmg to infantry and monstrotious creatures, but many faction spams a lot of armor, leman russ, hammerhead etc. So while im charging a leman russ with my shitty whip, could i even make it worth it by dealing damage to it. 

Next thing is that where many faction have ""dedicated"" tank unit or hero, drukhari dont have one, sure the archon have 67% feel no pain damage reduction was it? but when he gets attacked this shield fades away for 3 turns so you have to jiggle with him and make sure there is always escape for him, the only tanky unit is tantalus but its locked until you reach to tier 9 in tech. 

And then there is lack of vehicle repair, the only way to repair your vehicle is through influence and in cost of 45 influence you get 12 health back which is fair IF there would be another way to heal vehicle units. Back to the anti tank capabilities, there are only a few anti tank traits or units which are able to damage vehicles, those are haywire, lance. Reavers, ravagers, scourge and incubi, ""Correct me if there is more traits"". Reavers are very early game anti tank speeder so they fall off pretty quickly due the lack of survivability, scourges can get extra armour and heavy trait buff from tech tree but in my opinion you should not have to get ton of upgrades to the unit to be valuable choice, and lets not forget they have like 11hp so they're pretty much glass cannons but because of 2 range you have to kiss those deadly armours and then there is incubi which are melee anti tank, havent tried em properly yet so cant say much of them, in my experience melee against tanks is one hit to the tank and that unit is dead. so that leave us the ravager only good solid anti tank unit that deal good damage and can take a few hits, which you unlock tier 5 or 6 so pretty late.

Then there are few bugs i have encounterd, karbalite warriors dont get plasma grenades ""tier 1 upgrade"", when you try to heal wracks with Haemonculus it crashes your game. for the end hot take, all drukhari infantry should get combat drugs and the tier 10 upgrade would grant combat drugs to vehicles. I presonally have only 2 games with the drukhari and this review is based on that, some of these ""issues"" i have encountered could be skill issue but i really feel like that drukhari need buffing but if not that tweaking at least changing things. And for now i dont recomend it if you are looking strong and easy faction to play, but if you are looking for a challenge, uniqe and tough play style then go for it",1,0

"There is some promise to this small fighting game. The combat is based on having runes you put into slots and then having it tweaked with modifiers. I have not gone through it much, but it looks like it can stack to have some nice effects.

The only trouble I have with the controls is how floaty the jumping is. As soon as you are off the ground, the control you have is not very good, and the height feels awkward. You start with a double jump which is fine, but any platform jump requires that second jump. But the second jump is a bit awkward for how high it goes, where even in just the first shop room when you try to get to the second level of items, it will instead transition you to the next screen up. Also as a small note for the awkward movement is how slow your movement left/right is to get to top speed; it isn't terrible, but a linear increase from zero to top speed feels sluggish where a more logarithmic curve would feel more responsive.",1,0

"I don't think this is the worst game I've ever played and I wouldn't pay too much attention to this review in a couple of months if the dev keeps working on it. I also think it's odd that no-one appears to have tried this title. It's not THAT bad. That said, it didn't grab me personally and I think what is here is overpriced. It's worth something like $5.

The combat here is turn based, similar to Master of Magic or Age of Wonders if you've ever played those. You move the units one square at a time. You've got 2 ranks of 4 that you have to fill up with units, and then you engage 8 enemy units in battle. You start right up against each other, no maneuvering.

I don't know, there's a variety of units - horse archer, cavalry, infantry, an offensive spell class, and archers, but you don't get a lot of sense of contrast between them. Cavalry can only move one square just like infantry. You charge down a group of spellcasters in the enemy back row and you take as many casualties as they do. 

You also can't pick what units you have. You start with 2 infantry, a cavalry, I think 3 horse archers, 2 archers and 'witches', who are your casters. There's also a 'spy' in reserve. But with that force, you're going to have at least one group in the front row who shouldn't be in the front row, and if there's a way to buy new units and swap them out, I didn't see it.

The UI feels rough and there are some glitches, like in the battle I fought there was a text message saying something like, ""Start battle"" and it remained on the screen the whole time. That's EA stuff, but I have to mention it.

I didn't play long enough to really try out the Roguelike and Campaign aspects of the game, as the battle and army setup didn't draw me in enough to keep playing.

If the dev keeps working on this, and say, creates a greater flexibility in the units you can field, a larger battlefield so you can manuever, smooths out the UI, so you've got a battle that is more like Master of Magic. And then has a good Roguelike/campaign mode I can see this being a decent title and worth $11. But I wouldn't get it yet, not for the price it's at anyway.",1,0

4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1,0

"Payday 3: A Disastrous Heist

I recently picked up Payday 3 with high hopes, given my love for the previous titles in the series. However, after spending some time with the game, I can confidently say that it has been nothing short of a disappointment. Payday 3 is a buggy mess that runs terribly, and it's filled with <missing string entry> that ruin the overall experience.

Let's start with the bugs. From the moment I launched the game, it was clear that the developers at Overkill Studios had not put in the necessary time and effort to ensure a polished release. Graphical glitches, crashes, and performance issues plague Payday 3. Frame rates drop to unplayable levels, making even the simplest heists a frustrating endeavor. It's as if the game is trying to rob you of your patience instead of letting you enjoy the heist.

But the most unforgivable aspect of Payday 3 is the presence of <missing string entry>. It's shocking to see such a basic and fundamental issue in a game of this caliber. Key information, dialogue, and crucial mission details are simply missing, leaving players confused and disconnected from the storyline. It's like trying to complete a puzzle with half of the pieces missing.

The sound design is equally problematic. Gunfire sounds are inconsistent, and the music is forgettable at best. The lack of polish in this department further contributes to the feeling that Payday 3 was rushed to market without proper quality control.

The AI in Payday 3 is another major letdown. Teammates and enemies alike behave erratically, often making the game feel more like a chaotic circus than a tactical heist. This lack of intelligent AI detracts from the immersion and strategic depth that the series was once known for.

In conclusion, Payday 3 is an unmitigated disaster. It's riddled with game-breaking bugs, performs terribly on even high-end systems, and the presence of <missing string entry> issues is inexcusable. This game feels like it was released in a half-baked state to capitalize on the franchise's popularity, and it's a slap in the face to loyal fans who were expecting a worthy successor to the previous titles. I would strongly advise against wasting your time and money on this broken mess of a game.",0,1

During my gameplay, the game features really good survival mechanics. The base building is very clean, simple and nice. The combat is rough with melee weapons but if you rock the bow and arrows then combat is very cool, i enjoyed it a lot. Looting is clean, abundant, with a fair amount of resources all around to get started and build you way up. So highly recommend to anyone who is into survival games and enjoys the slight cartoonist looking graphics, but trust me it still looks very good graphically. About one of the only things that bothered me was the bobbing movement of the character but after a little bit, i honestly just didn't even notice it much anymore, but did request this to be a toggled on/off feature if possible. Hope yall found my review to be helpful, much love all :)",0,1
"I seldom have mixed feelings about AoE 2 DE content, I either love it, or hate it. These feelings usually come in the form my reaction to what is brought before me, regardless of the type of content which is why I could love a Civilization, but absolutely loathe a map they are strong in, for example. 

With that premise in mind I'd like to share my thoughts on the DLC, and what it brought to the table.

The things I love(d):
1. The new Civilizations. 
Great in concept, great in reality, all three Civs have introduced new (and for many, older and reluctant to change and innovation players) scary mechanics, never seen in the game before, such as the Ratha Unique Unit, or the Wootz steel tech. (which is VERY scary to face) With those in mind and all the other additions to the game thanks to these new civs, I can say the DLC is a banger and opens a lot of possibilities and roads for diversified yet consistent gameplay. This is healthy, great job devs. 

2. The changes to the game.
Addressing feedback from the community, both at the top and at the bottom of the ladder is a tricky situation to handle and sometimes you face the hurdle of the majority  of the playerbase trashing on you because one pro did one thing and suddenly their favourite thing is gone. If League of Legends (10+ million players at its peak) managed to climb such a mountain, so could the Forgotten Empires team, and they did. 
-Attack Move exploit Fixed (maybe a bit too well haha) 
-KOTD4 Arabia removed (Sorry memb, but that map got really boring really fast, despite forging people in fire.)
-Improvements to Melee unit pathing with attack move etc...
While it's true that you could argue that these changes are not related to the DLC, they certainly are, as the patch came in bundled with it and this patch took a long time to polish and make sure it worked as it should. 


Now for the bads, which aren't many, but hey. 
1.The Campaigns. 
This is a thorn in my side because the effort and dedication of map makers and scripters and Campaign devs IS ENORMOUS and it really pains me to say that I did not enjoy the campaigns. 
The stories they tell are GREAT, I love them and I really find them to be pleasant and engaging. 
The gameplay however, is decently frustrating and unfortunately not up to par to previous campaigns. 
In terms of mechanics, uniqueness and flexibility the campaigns in the Dynasties of India DLC are severely inferior to the Lords of the West and Dawn of the Dukes campaigns:
One mission of the Hauteville Campaign in example had more mechanics than the whole Dravidian Campaign, ouch. 
The Campaign AI (I played on Hard) quite blatantly cheats and/or is given a huge advantage over the player [and before anyone asks, I am 1400 on the ladder, I stomp hard AI(and get stomped by players hehe) ] in all possible given ways, either with infinite population or resources or with really annoying map cheating, which is definitely not a new thing, but in previous DLC campaigns it was either really veiled, or not present (very noticeable in AoC campaigns for comparison's sake.) 
So overall no, because of the clunkiness of certain mechanics (Mission 4 Dravidians having to be in a town to use it is no bueno) and the frustrating and not so engaging gameplay which timers aren't meant to have you enjoy a fun storytelling experience, but rather a sluggish slog through the mud of GRINDY GAMEPLAY I can't say I can recommend the Campaigns of this DLC. At least not at the hardest difficulty. Just enjoy them at moderate to avoid pointless mental fatigue. 

Saving grace: The Davepala Campaign. Given its lesser level of difficulty as a whole, the story and gameplay are quite fitting and the experience is pleasant albeit devoid of unusual mechanics (I will quote again the Hauteville campaign as a benchmark)
Babur's wasn't bad either, but nothing special or very remarkable.

All in all I can't not Recommend the DLC, it's good and everyone that worked on it deserves a lot of credit and love, despite my harsh criticism. Just don't go in and expect campaigns to stomp Jadwiga's or the Hauteville's.


EDIT JUL 28 2022: 
Changed the review from positive to Negative. 
The total lack of response from the dev team has been nothing short of appalling. 
The released Civs (which as I said before, are interesting and I like the mechanics introduced) are EXTREMELY unbalanced; The Bengali are the worst Civ ever added to the game, sporting the lowest winrate% in just 3 months since their release, while the Gurjaras are literally PAY TO WIN, being the strongest most broken faction ever added to the game. But what is really baffling is that in THREE MONTHS, T H R E E, the devs have completely IGNORED the players that have been calling for changes and fixes. For the first time ever I've witnessed to Pay to win being added to a RTS game, and it is sapping my enjoyement out of it because I'd rather resign than play another match on the ladder vs Gurjaras knowing that I won't learn anything from losing to a possibly worse player that just needs to change which button they press from the stable to win vs me. Or make 4 chakram throwers and kill my 25 pikemen in 3 volleys. 

When Lords of the west came out, both the Burgundians and the Sicilians were nerfed instantly the moment both the community and pros demanded changes to OP aspects of the civ. Here we are, still waiting for Bengali not to be a waste of space and Gurjara to not be the abomination of design that they are. Get a grip.",1,0

"[h3][b][i]Are you not entertained!?[/i][/b][/h3]
A thumbs-down is synonymous with death, ancient Romans and half-naked barechested sweaty men battling underneath the watchful eyes of the hot daylight, or gladiators as some call them. Yet that is a misconception. Que!?! Russell Crowe lied? Indeed he did. You see, it was, in fact, the thumbs-up gesture which ushered in a swift death. But why am I talking about gladiators and their firmly-oiled bushy pecs? Why not. Also, I wanted to clear up any potential misunderstandings among the gladiator history enjoyers that read my negative review but see I didn't give it a thumbs up. So, now you know — I'm not equating Steam's thumbs-up/down system to that of the ancient Roman gladiator fights.

And before I go on my rant, as this is a story-driven game, I wager what I say will ruin the story. So, here is what I propose — if the game looks appealing, [b]I say go for it.[/b] You'll be supporting a solo dev that did make a good game — [b]just not a game I enjoyed.[/b] And who knows, you might enjoy it and come back to tell me what a silly slav I am.

With that public safety announcement done, let's get to the good stuff — [b]me complaining![/b]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2939668889
[h3][b][i]Live by the story, die by the story.[/i][/b][/h3]
Story-based games are tough to recommend/not recommend. They often have no palpable gameplay, with the story being the sole factor impacting our entertainment. But we won't all enjoy nor resonate with the game's story to the same degree. So, based on how well we jell with the story, the game's receiving either our adoration or the end of a thicc leather whip. 
[b]I chose violence.[/b]

Why?

To put it bluntly — [b]it's boring.[/b] While a not-so-original idea, the game does put its own spin on it. However, it just doesn't deliver in the end. It was too on the nose about its twists, and none blindsided me, with the ending not really worth the wait. The story also tries to be profound with its theme, but the simplistic dialogue doesn't help. Definitely not [i]soma[/i]tastic.

But worse, as an average animal tissues enjoyer, I found the taste of the main cast bland — [b]they lacked meat.[/b] It's as if these characters exist for plot convenience. And with me not emotionally invested in what my avatar does or is going through, coupled with a pretty predictable and dull story, [i]Titan Station[/i] was a skater boy, and I said, [b][i]""See you later, boy.""[/i][/b]

But before we move on to the gameplay, I have some nitpicks.

The game's setting is ripe for some horror love. I mean, a seemingly abandoned space station? It just screams, [i]""Something ain't right.""[/i] Yet, no danger lurks in the many shadows cast via the game's superb lighting system. A real shame. Even one horror section would do the trick, as the thought of that [i]thing[/i] returning would be a dear friend throughout my time at Titan station. Sadly, we get none of that. No [i]thing[/i]. No tension. Just long hallways that get closely acquainted with your soles due to how many times you'll track them to get from A to B.

Now for my next nitpick — [b]dialogue choices.[/b] Why? Why is this even a thing? To keep players engaged under the false pretence that their choice matters? They have no story impact. There are no branching paths. There is nothing that warrants a dialogue choice system. The story is set in stone, and nothing you do/say will change how it plays out.

[h3][b][i]Slide that Floppy disk in! Slide it in real good.[/i][/b][/h3]
But what about the gameplay? It's your typical uneventful walking simulator. You walk through a ton of samey-looking tight corridors and interact with terminals and doors by sticking your floppy disk in them. However, sometimes a door won't take your floppy disk, or the terminal needs a password. This is where Dave's fingers come in clutch — [b]it's time to stretch those bad boys.[/b] Sounds more fun than it actually is. In reality, you find the code, written down, somewhere in the room and select the password from the choice menu, which pops up when you interact with the locked door or terminal.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2902057099

Besides sticking things into other things, sometimes using your fingers, there are a couple Tron puzzle sections. They are okayish. Pretty skinny on the challenge, with it being just a basic [i]create-a-from-RGB-cubes-and-connect-them-to-a-designated-spot[/i] puzzle. The first time it was fun — the subsequent trips to Tron land were not.

But, I'll end this review on a positive. Sadly, it didn't change my view of the game, as the story and boring gameplay pretty much cemented it. Shame, as the [b]presentation[/b] is superb. [i]Titan Station[/i] truly blessed my eyes with its stunning visuals, delivering a surreal space trip. And everything is so detailed and clean. I could almost feel them in my palms. And the shadows... my god! The lighting system is a wet dream for anyone who enjoys games that deliver true darkness. Shame it's wasted with no spooky stuff.

There is also RayTracing, which is not that noticeable unless you are looking at your fps. That bad boy spanked my RTX 3070 quite hard to around 30 fps with everything on ultra, on an ultrawide 1080p resolution. Kudos for the ultrawide support, as well. However, with DLSS quality mode, a stable 60fps with everything ultra (including RT) was possible. And the image quality loss due to DLSS is not visible to the naked eye during motion. I had to stop moving and give my screen a smooch with my eyeballs to tell the difference. Quite a remarkable feat by this solo dev. So yeah, graphically, this game is pure ecstasy for your eyes, and when you do finally step outside... [b]Perfection.[/b]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2939665652

The audio is also good, with voice actors delivering a splendid performance. Even Dave's corny jokes were delivered with corniness. So, big thumbs up for that. There are also tons of those retro PC terminals your average [i]Fallout/Alien[/i] enjoyer will probably be giddy about. Just a lot of [b][i]*beep boop*[/i][/b] and purring noises the terminal screens make.

Overall, the presentation was immaculate. It delivered an excellent atmosphere, but that mattered very little when the gameplay and story slam-dunked my face into the sands of Titan.

And that's [i]Titan Station.[/i] The game looks clean and sounds nice but has monotonous gameplay and a predictable story with bland characters that I honestly didn't care for by the end. I wanted to like this game, as I enjoy sci-fi stuff, and this looked like a sure thing from the trailer I saw. [b]But this just ain't it.[/b] At least nobody heard me yawn because we was in space.

- The graphics fantastically set the mood for each level (but the soldier colour palettes camouflage them sometimes, making it hard to see them when they're the most dangerous hostile)
- The imagery, zombies and story are very anti-USSR, not sure if that's intentional but considering the Russian creator of the game, it was worth a laugh

"I am not really sure what to think of this avn. The renders are good, the girls look better than your average avn girl. The story is okay albeit a bit far-fetched. The grammar is so/so.

It is actually very simple. The dev sets up a sexy scene but then inserts something that makes it impossible to progress further. You take one of the girls to a hotel but then can't progress because you both had 1 beer and that means you're drunk and shouldn't move on. This results in more teasing. Which is essentially what 90% of the 18+ scenes are. Teasing. Teasing. Teasing.

[h1]Introduction:[/h1]
A short, child-friendly hidden object game where you pan across a fairly small summery scene, Hidden Bunny is decent, but in no way memorable or outstanding. 

[h3]Summary:[/h3]
[B]Performance:[/b]
• RAM: 16GB Dual-Channel DDR4 @ 1600MHz
• CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700U with 512MB ATI AMD Radeon Graphics
• Storage: WD 500GB SSD

Hidden Bunny was playable on highest graphics, but far smoother on lowest. My laptop got pretty warm, but this runs fine on low-end hardware.

[b]Positives:[/b]
•	Pleasant graphics on high settings
•	Achievements. Easy 100%
[b]Note:[/b] For now, and until it meets engagement criteria (e.g enough people buying it) the achievements won’t count to your profile completion stats).

[b]Negatives:[/b]
•	No manual saving
•	No hints
•	Forced to collect things in order

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
Hidden Bunny is surprisingly pretty given its low price. It has four presets - the lowest dramatically different to the highest. It presented a sunny, warm, peaceful atmosphere that was pleasing on the eyes. The placement of hidden objects makes some use of camouflage, size, and positioning in the environment occasionally, but for the most part makes no real effort to conceal anything. I had trouble finding one rabbit who was small and from most angles poorly contrasted with a part of the environment that took me a while to find, but otherwise this game is quite easy and its visual presentation is fine.

[h1]Audio:[/h1]
The soundscape is unremarkable. Writing this review the following day I’ve totally forgotten the music and recall only bare minimum environmental sounds emanating from various animals. They’re just functional. I make no complaint here, but also offer no praise.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
A simple matter of using WSAD to pan across the scene, the mouse wheel to zoom, and the mouse button to select, constitutes all there is to the gameplay of Hidden Bunny. This you will repeat for around half an hour to an hour in a bid to find various collections of hidden objects.

One thing that bothered me when I played was that though there are several categories of hidden objects here (bunnies, crocodiles, toucans, etc) you are not able to select them as you see them. You are required to find all bunnies, then all toucans, etc. I understand this may primarily be to present a challenge, but I didn’t like it as it artificially drags the game on. Compare this with other hidden object games like this where you have various items in one scene (Hidden Paws, 100 hidden x series, etc.) which place no such limitation - I preferred their approach in this respect.

There are also no manual saves. You must complete the current goal or lose its progress which accounts for some 20ish minutes of my game time. And there’s no hint feature to help. In terms of the actual control of the game… it is rough around the edges, but passable. Quality of life features, though, are a little lacking, which made my experience a bit less enjoyable.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
While having hints would be nice, Hidden Bunny isn’t really difficult enough to warrant it. The only two things that really count against the game for me are the lack of manual saving, and the requirement to find items in a category order the game imposes. Neither thing is actually game-breaking though, and so my overall review is just barely positive since Steam’s binary forces my hand. It is pretty enough to look at, it has easy achievements, and is a casual way to pass an hour or so. It’s decent, but also nothing special.

"For someone familiar with the 2 main games before it, and the few ""official"" joke games put out by the developers, it originally felt like it was shooting for a mix of backstage episode with the doujinshi joke works of the past, which sure, April Fools release, what else do you expect.

But considering it leans in on telling a serious story about as much if not more than it tries to fool around, frontloading the jokes seems like it was a bad call, especially when it doesn't do that much fun with the format.
It might have benefitted from even more fooling around and delivering a serious story in the manner of an off hand whimsy like it is no big deal.

Another point against the frontloaded jokes being that the entire thing was too linear, sure the serious story could have been as is, but there were absolutely no choices to fool around in the joke RPG part, which is something that even Requiem for Innocence had in the bit where it was fooling around [spoiler]trying to appear to be a dating sim[/spoiler].
The whole RPG part had so much potential for cracking meta jokes and non canon stupid endings [spoiler]like J.B. min/maxing so hard the game breaks[/spoiler]

From a technical standpoint it has a few typos and misc localization errors. But what annoyed me more is the fact they used the new text presentation format not only for the IRC logs part(which it fits nicely) but also the few flashback dialogues and the epilogue. Do I even need to point out that a wall of text that isn't color coded or have a handle to determine who is speaking at which paragraph or have brackets for thoughts is a bad idea?

Overall the story had more room to spread its wings compared to a Requiem for Innocence which was heavily chained down by being a prequel without much room to pull out crazy developments because it would break continuity.
But it was too linear, missed a chapter of fluff where the very late joining character could get used to the setting in a natural way as opposed to feeling too on board with the situation and ""script reading"" [spoiler]Maria who speaks like knowing too much and a bit too forward, even if you take into account her further plot development.[/spoiler]
But then it also spent a good chunk of time with needless flowery language just to describe something as ""incomprehensible and ineffable"". I'd rather suspend my disbelief on the characters going along with it in 2 sentences, than having it to use text space that could have given the script reader a bit of extra time to feel less like one.

Either way, I still found it pretty good, but it is still in the shadow of how amazing The House in Fata Morgana was. But since it was not restrained to being a prequel or a sequel, it had more moments than A Requiem for Innocence.

Oh and how could you hate on it if it has the incredible fan favorite character that only appeared in one side story and one of those joke games, have a lot of screen time in Seventh Lair?",0,1

"*Disclaimer*  I am writing this review in comparison to Eastside Hockey Manager, which I love and have put over 1000hrs into.  

Likes:

- The price point is very good as of Dec '23, if you're going to get this game, now is the time to do it.
- Very customizable, looks like even more than EHM so far.
- The ability to start way back in history is pretty cool.  I haven't played with it yet to see how historically accurate the rosters are, I suspect that's going to have to be community roster downloads, but that's fine.
- Player chemistry is cool, I really like this.  I think EHM has that, but it's all behind the scenes and you don't see it.  Here you can see it.
- It shows what stage of development teams are in, and staff favours teams in different stages of development.  

Not sure:

- You can customize so much that you can make the game as easy or hard as you want, whereas in EHM there is only one level.  On one hand you can basically go full cheat mode, on the other you can make it super difficult.  I think I like this, but it will take time to grow into and find a setting that gives me the right amount of challenge.
- The family dynamic seems like a neat idea, not sure how much impact it will actually have on the game.
- Staff stats.  I like the idea of scouts being better and gaining experience in different regions.  Also I like that as they gain experience they get different perks.  I dislike that they are not as detailed in different areas of the game that you may want to focus on.  In the end I think this system may be better, just have to get used to it, but it would be great to marry the two.

Dislikes:

- Moving players on and off the roster is clunky.  Especially if you're trying to see the player stats AND the position they play while managing your roster.  These are not found on the same screen.
- No training camp.
- Player stats are not near as detailed as EHM.
- No pro scouting, all info on a player is available once they've been drafted.
- Didn't see a way to add unsigned prospects to trades.  I'm guessing there is a way, but it isn't intuitive.
- Navigation through the game in general in cumbersome.  Maybe it's just that I'm used to a different format, but this is the biggest downside of this game to me.
- Not really anything for in game tactics, so not much point to doing anything other than simming the game.
- Would be nice to have info about what things mean if you hover over them or click them.

I've played a preseason now.  I don't find the navigation intuitive or fast.  It feels like work to play this game.  Despite all the great features, I just don't enjoy playing this game.  I'm perfectly willing to admit I may be too much of an EHM fanboy to adapt to what this game is, and I hope others enjoy it.  It is clear the devs have put a lot of work and thought into making a deep management sim.

[u]Here's The Thing:[/u]
You see the world, now in the wake of the KN028 virus having ravaged it and turned millions into zombies, through Alfred’s eyes and suffering is the life many are all too familiar with… He wakes up one day to find his brother Jake has gone to seek out one “Captain Jack” who’s supposedly taking in survivors. Antsy that the worst has happened, he sets out to catch up to his only family before it’s too late ~


[h1][u][+] PROS;[/u][/h1]

[h1]:) A-HA, SEE WHATCHU DID THERE. I’LL TAKE YOU ON~[/h1]
Plays somewhat like a mutated sister of [b]Resident Evil’s (RE)[/b] tank control and [b]Silent Hill’s (SH)[/b] 3D over-the-shoulder camera! A welcome change that then immediately plunges you into familiar territory as well as mechanics like having precious ink ribbons to save progress, storage boxes, green herbs to munch on… or snort. Well, you get the picture; an obvious homage that doesn’t bother to cover its tracks.

There are even minuscule brain teasers such as cracking number combinations, the now-obligatory sliding picture puzzle, way-finding to proceed to the next area, and the usual birds and the bees of survival! You should be right at home with the combat seeing as it gets the job done despite being otherwise elementary and not going overboard on the weapon variety.

The first run occupies roughly 3 hours on account of the hard-hitting zombies and a handful of careless deaths. $2 for a RE-like title seems overly generous, but alas there’s a catch- several in fact. See you in the cons~

[u]TIPS:[/u]
1) Knife can stun-lock the zombie goons.


[h1]:) PLAYS YOU LIKE A FIDDLE, BUT THAT’S OK… FOR THE MOST PART.[/h1] 
The low-poly graphics grant it that dose of PS1 nostalgia which would’ve been enough to sway your judgement, but the list of locations you’re to frequent; however little the actual resemblances give it that extra kick of reminiscence towards the named survival horror games regardless! The vacant city streets are grand and disorderly, their presence only extending onto the areas you’re to frequent. Whether it be a derelict apartment building where hope goes to inhabit before committing suicide, a police station that’s seen better days just longing for crime, a hospital so desperate for patients it will inflict- so on and so forth.

I appreciated and adored the sound design more than anything it had to offer visually… It complemented the loneliness and deathly silent atmosphere by having you walk-run with either nothing but the noises you make or the snarls of zombies. RE/SH-ish music only materializes out of thin air in safe rooms (if even then), boss encounters, jumpscares, and when Alfred literally whips out his instrument to strum away and sing a tune~
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2984465756


[h1]:) A NIGHTMARE… RE-CREATED!? Z FOR YOURSELF![/h1]
The plot is largely exempt of any profound influences and probably the most original out of everything! That said, the searching for family plot line gave me throwbacks to [b]RE2[/b] & [b]SH (1999)[/b]; the looking for a safe haven- [b]RE Afterlife[/b]. The minutely open-world design of a city in ruins recalled specific instances of [b]SH Origins[/b], [b]The Last of Us[/b], and [b]I Am Legend[/b]. Seems like a lot of watered-down caricatures, but they didn’t come off as such. It appeared to genuinely attempt (emphasis on this) to tell a heartfelt story that could rival even [b]The Walking Dead[/b] only more close-knit and small-scale~


[h1][u][-] CONS;[/u][/h1]

[h1]:( MORE LIKE, THE DEAD AREN’T ALL DEAD!?[/h1]
While I’m most thankful the narrative isn’t as heavily plagiarized as their previous entry[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadeGuard98/recommended/2363930/] Evil Is Back[/url], which by the way they’ve gotten away with, this time they’ve reached a new low… What’d they do? Well, they copied RE & SH in a “style over substance” manner and once more have to lean on nostalgia for crutches! This particular endeavor grossly reminded me of[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadeGuard98/recommended/1978010/] Delivery Man (DM)[/url], which was yet another game averse to the word “new” and inserted only what they themselves thought were the most telling elements of what made a RE title!

This naturally led to the existence of previously context-laden puzzles which shouldn’t otherwise belong here for they defy all logic. With the only explanation being, well, other than the fact that the OGs had them back then; ergo their inclusion is more than justified. Despite DM doing it a tinge better, both were outright starved of any worthwhile personality or memorable characters… serving solely as placeholder “remember that more interesting individual in RE/SH? Yeah, good times”.


[h1]:( ON THE MAP ALRIGHT- FOR DIFFERENT INFERIOR REASONS.[/h1]
I was feeling the locations initially, but variety did JAKE all in taking away from the reality that they were subpar in their dressing and layout. I thought the apartment was the biggest offender with rooms that differed little to none from each other. But really, every single area was ridiculously spacious and identical in their environmental storytelling thanks to repeating props… Almost as if to exclaim “forget interesting set pieces, we just need places to pad the runtime” which becomes gospel in the next cons~


[h1]:( NOT ON THE RIGHT… BACKTRACK![/h1]
You would think “RE-esque title” and “fun” are synonymous, well think again; the latter is aggressively as well as aggravatingly replaced by long bouts of backtracking. Sheer amount of plot-bending done to allow for key items to be found in places that, in a sane world, would have zero chances of being associated! This key with no discernible markers whatsoever must open that locked door from halfway across the city…! DUH!!

The bullet sponge bosses painfully drain the fun out of the very sad amount there already was. To add insult to injury? 2/3 of bosses could’ve been easily bypassed by simply ignoring them had you been permitted to use your brain. It’s only cause the game forces you to deal with them by making that completely unobstructed gap and the door that wasn’t locked suddenly inaccessible. Lastly, the degree of inventory stupidity going on whereby picking up similar items don’t automatically pool them together and so you have to slow travel to safe rooms to dump your crap. It’s just a whole thing to artificially pad the runtime in terms of gameplay~
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2984468786


[h1]:( CLEAN UP YOUR ACT. PRETTY PLEASE!?[/h1]
Put simply, Twitch streamers rarely make for good voice actors. There, said it! At least pick the semi-decent ones much like[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadeGuard98/recommended/2026870/] Night at the Gates of Hell[/url] did. If I wanted disinterested & soulless reads that border on hilarity, I would just view an adult film~


[h1]BUGS:[/h1]
x Entering a new area, the camera does this thing where it flies towards the player-
x 2 of 3 bosses can be exploited through environmental means.
x Alfred clips with certain objects
x Camera stutters when touching the environment
x Textures keep changing place…
x Auto-aim disabled when an object gets in your way.


[h1]NITPICKS:[/h1]
~ Gun reloads automatically…!
~ Map opacity is terrible.
~ “Files” menu has more slots than there are notes! Misleading.
~ Short black screens after QTEs are jarringly intrusive.


[h1]""DON’T MEAN IT’S EXCUSED FROM A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED RIBBON!!?""[/h1]

[u]Last Words?[/u]
Scarily basic survival horror that bares too much of its muses… Save for a few scraps of novelty & sincerity; winds up feeling derivative, ill thought out, and rushed. “Affordable” came at a price~

"I’m not sure how many people will remember this, the year is 2000, and a brand new game was taking the market by storm, an addictive game that put hundreds of thousands of people together on a massive scale rarely ever seen prior to that.. No the game wasn’t called real life, but Everquest, one of the originators of 3-D MMORPG’s, people were hooked, lives were changed, and many people learned the joys of urinating into a bottle sitting beside your desk so that giant POS sitting next to you doesn’t steal that enemy spawn you’ve been sitting on for close to 12 hours..  

Well anyway, I played that game like the rest, my Dwarf, would run around butcherblock mountains killing Goblins, snakes, skeletons and everything else I could find..   One day while out hunting some beaver, I saw a beautiful pixilated tall blonde haired female with huge jugs...  Yeah she was some water she war carrying.. What did you think I meant you sicko?  After trying to talk with her and giving her all 50 PP I had saved up the week I played, she ran away and took my money.. I was distraught over my lost, and nearly gave up.. That is until I discovered a land full of high elf females known as Felwithe..  I spend the rest of my time wandering around that place oogling a bunch of high elf females..  Most were probably played by dudes like me, but in an MMO we’re supposed to suspend belief..  

Anyway, I don’t know why I want off on that little memory lane, because because this game reminded me of what I would have liked to do all those years ago when I discovered the Elven woman in Everquest..  In the words of Quagmire, “Giggity, Giggity”.. 

So speaking of the game... which might I add has probably the greatest name of any video game I’ve ever played..   “Elf wives cheat to ride my meat”..  With a name that clever I’m sure the visual novel written with in will be on some old Shakespear, Poe or Homer level...  

Story - you used to be an adventurer but then you took an arrow to the Knee, or the head, or maybe the buttocks like Forrest Gump..  After your injury you took over the post at the adventurers guild as the quest giver, spending your days giving out quest like Roz from Monsters Inc. With a lot less sarcasm and a lot more perversion..  Being that you’ve gone from an adventurer to a paper pusher, you decide to do what anyone in a position of power would do.. Use that power to abuse people and take advantage of them sexually..  I guess in the world of fantasy they don’t have HR departments..  The game follows your exploits as you trick, coerce, and generally use very questionable methods to get various dark elf females to let you make sexy time with them..

Gameplay  - A cherry Kiss game, so you know what that means.. Poorly translated, mosaic laden sex scenes, dialogue that makes Vincent Gallo look like Wes Anderson, and lots of urine, Sea Man and Dead Pan looks from the females that will have you thinking about the sewer scenes in the IT movie.. Not the book were all the underage kids have an orgy, but the movie where Beverly Marsh stares into space unaware of anything going on around her..   In other words a game which blocks out the nudity, the sexual content, and anything else that might make it fap worthy..  Leaving behind decent drawn scenes that you continually set to auto skip unseen text for.. 

Pro’s 

Easy 5 minutes 100%, if you skip unseen text
Good artwork
1 out of 10 on the Fap o meter

Con’s 
Mosaics, yep I know why they are there but.. Come on...
Cringe poorly translated text
Zero replay value

Recommendations 

Maybe I’m a bit hard on Cherry Kiss games, in theory they aren’t bad, just very cringe, and all the good parts are covered over..  Yes, if you’re going to release adult games on steam that are censored, you either need to provide a Uncensored DLC, or host either officially or unofficially an offsite DLC mod.  Anything less is uncivilized, especially when you’re charging over 10 dollars per game.. I know the whole reasoning behind it, but other developers/publishers in the same boat got around this with unofficial mods..  So that excuse is sort of, kind of unresonable..

As a game it’ll give you a super easy 100%, which isn’t worth the price tag with the censored content and bad writing (badly translated I think) And without the good bits and pieces being shown, you’re left with a game which is kind of pointless..   If the writing was better and not so cringe, you could likely look the other way about the censorship but with the cringe writing it just magnifies it..",1,0
"What can I say about the game.  This was actually a fairly hard game to review.  I fully played through both chapters that are currently available.  

First, the good:  The game runs very smoothly.  There are not many bugs or glitches, which is a very nice aspect for a game.  The atmosphere is nice looking.  For those that complain about reused assets, it just needs to be accepted that not everyone has the time, money or skill to create their own everything from the ground up.  Indie devs need to utilize common assets and I'm cool with that.  The main things for me are story, game play and the overall atmosphere.  Also, how to smartly manage the scares can be a major addition of points or subtraction.

With that being said, as of now, the story is very confusing.  I feel like there really isn't one beyond the guy was on his way home, got into an accident and is now stuck here in this house.  As of writing this, there are only 2 chapters, so it may/will get cleared up later on.  It is early access so I won't be so harsh on that.  There's really nothing explaining what is going on and you have to interpret things from the videos you see at the end of each chapter.  You don't really find any notes or hints as to why this place is so messed up.  The beginning makes no sense, but I can ignore it cause it's just there to get you to the house, but you hit a tree right next to a random alcohol shack that's on the other side of a river, past a cemetery that's attached to a mansion.....why?  Who builds a random shack in the middle of nowhere that is attached to a mansion?  why was there a campfire there?  It just makes no logical sense, but the main story is the house anyway. 

The AI is a bit basic, which makes the evil girl fairly simple to avoid.  As far as chases go, after you figure out how it moves and that you are faster, there's no real tension moving around.  There are a few good jump scares and that aspect of the game is great.  There's some hiccups with things like shooting and such, hiding in areas and moving around, but nothing drastic.  I personally feel like they could have done more with less.  The gun, the camera the lighter the flashlight, I just feel like it was put in cause they could, not that it pertains to the game or story.  It's just too much and it makes no sense why each one shows up at each point.  It's as if they wanted to include it all, cause they could, and really doesn't pertain to much.  

I can't really justify the 15.99 price point at this time.  It's a bit much for this game, but overall it's not bad and it has potential.  At this time I'd have to say I wouldn't recommend it MAINLY because of the price.  An incomplete game with a few quirks and has no real replay-ability.....  If the story was amazing, clear and formed early, then maybe I could, and this has no reflection on the work the devs have done.   It is a promising and good game, just not $16 dollars.  

If there was more promise, maybe, but at this time, I can't justify it at all.  Maybe $7 or even MAYYYYYBBEEE $10, but I've played a lot of Indie horror games,  some good, a lot bad.  The price is just too much for what you are getting.

Outside of that, it really is a pretty fluid game, they did a good job for the most part, but it is a very simple game with very basic gameplay, map, and a very unclear story.  If the game was complete, I may be able to see the price point, but as of now, we don't know where the game is going, have no idea about what is going on now and I can't recommend it for the price.

You can check it out for yourself here with a fuller breakdown and decide if you want to pay and see if it get's better since it is early access, but that is a decision you have to make as a horror gaming fan.

"Not a bad effort but there isn't too much substance. Ya pretty much swim around while avoidin' a shark and a creature. While gettin' stalked you can check out various wrecks and other things on the sea floor. I think the game could've done with some voice actin' to spice things up a bit and to add a few more things to see and do while tryin' to survive the 10 hours. Middle thumb for this one.

"+ low price

- Menu is pretty basic, not the biggest deal but gives off a ""game jam"" vibe.
- You can reduce you attack to 0. Not a minimum of 1. 0. Pick the wrong item and it ends your run as you no longer can kill anything or gain XP to fix your mistake.
- camera shows you a lot of what is at the top of the screen, but little at the bottom so enemies feel like their teleporting in below you.

"**Edit: I will update the review as there are new updates, so I may change my opinion in the future.

I'd say I'd recommend it if I didn't feel a little cheated. I love the art direction, the characters and overall the game's vibe but after playing several games and reloading multiple autosaves, I have come to some conclusions:

Actually what they sold through their ads, the demo and in general, everything they have promoted through their social media is not quite true. Why? Because although they sold it as a potion store simulator, what they ""sold"" the most was the ROMANTIC factor. And if you want to be able to follow the plot of the game and not get a game over (having to start over from the beginning) you're going to have to practically ignore your possible love interests/friends, since you must manage to create some very specific potions before the competition (in which you must participate). **They have nerfed the competition in their last update so now is easier.

The reason you have to ignore your possible love interests is because of the way they have distributed the time slots (6 in total). Which vanish in a matter of 2 or 3 ""moves"" like selling potions (which costs 2 of those slots) or visiting your friends or shopkeepers (which costs between 1 or 2 or more slots depending on the actions you do). This makes it VERY frustrating to have to combine the ""mini-game"" part that is creating potions and collecting ingredients for the competition and the fact of wanting to advance in the relationships with the characters. A curious thing is that if you advance a lot your relationship status with the characters they give you discounts, but we can hardly reach these levels without neglecting our main objective: THE COMPETITION.

On the other hand, the collection of materials and ingredients also becomes very tedious because it resorts to the random factor or basically ""be lucky that you get just the material you needed before the day of the competition"". 

My proposals would be:
-That the day be divided into various time slots or otherwise set up in a more flexible way to work so that it is simply difficult but not terribly exhausting as it is now.
-Maybe split the game into ""Story Mode"" and ""Competitive Mode"" so that each player could choose whether they prefer a more chill gameplay or want to go all out with potion creation.

I'm actually loving the game, I'm still dedicating hours to it (trying to pass the competition lol). But what disappointed me the most is to find something that I didn't expect, something that I hadn't been sold or shown in the demo or in the promotion. I hope they take the time to read the feedback and consider improving the game system.

I have to add that another element that I dislike is the fact that the game has so many interesting features and only consists of 50 days (5 competitions). Once this is completed, the game is over (?) It's makes me sad! This game has a lot of content that could be extended in a sandbox mode.

**For people who find it contradictory that I still like the game and put hours into it: you can like something and still criticize it. Honestly, I think there is a lot of room for improvement in this game. I love the style and the characters, and the mini-games are entertaining, but they have some negative points IN MY OPINION, which I have already discussed above. ^^

"First off, the RTX makes this mod look great. And it's a free mod, so I absolutely won't judge it as harshly as a paid product. But if you're making a mod for one of the greatest puzzle games of all time, I would expect the puzzles to be better. The puzzles aren't difficult because they have clever solutions, they're difficult because the solutions require nearly perfect timing and execution. Most of the time, solving a chamber felt like luck instead of critical thinking. With nearly every chamber I found myself asking ""Are they really going to make me do that? Or is there a fun, clever solution that I just haven't figured out yet?"" And each time the answer was yes, they're really going to make you do that. 
I should also mention that a lot of the puzzles are momentum-based. Jumping into portals, quickly placing new portals, flying around, etc. The slow camera rotation in Portal (which was fixed for Portal 2) makes these puzzles really disorienting and frustrating. The test chambers are often really tight with no room for error, so this movement ended up giving me a headache after just a few chambers.

There's a puzzle really early on that I assumed I was doing incorrectly. Then, a text box popped up and told me that if I was having trouble building momentum to solve the chamber, I should go into my settings and disable portal funneling. [b]Devs: If so many playtesters have trouble with a puzzle that you feel the need to insert popup text that instructs people to change their game settings to solve it, you've designed a puzzle that sucks.[/b]

Overall, it's a cool showcase of rtx technology and community love for Portal, but also a showcase of how well-designed valve's puzzles are. I appreciate the effort that went into this mod, but I think the puzzles themselves are poorly made.",1,0

TRANSFER CHARACTERS FROM DARK SUNS SHATTERED LANDS TO WAKE OF THE RAVAGER!!! First, you need to beat Shattered Lands, then when it drops you back into the game do any remaining side quests you want to and then save it. For steam you have to edit the game.conf in the Dark Sun 2 folder. Take the save game file from the original game, create a folder in the Dark Suns 2 Dosbox game folder where the RAVAGER folder is and name the new folder DSUN. At this point the only two folders should be RAVAGER and DSUN. this is the folder that Dosbox uses for C:\. Place the save game file from Dark Sun Shattered lands into the DSUN folder you just created. Now find the game.conf in the Dark Suns 2 folder  and edit it with notepad. Change where it says RAVAGE.BAT to CHARTRAN.EXE and save. Run the game like normal, it should show up with a screen that says something like C:\dsun C:\Ravager press enter to transfer. Press enter, you'll see it throw the character names up there and its done. Change the line in game.conf from CHARTRAN.EXE back to RAVAGE.BAT save and they should show up when you go to character creation, right click and chose add. You'll get the vast majority of your items when you start a game in ravager. All xp past lvl 9 will be added and after the first combat event you'll level up to where you XP is. For example my mage leveled from 9 to 12 immediately because even though the level cap in the first game was 9 I had the XP to get to lvl 12. Some of the armor pieces and various books and quest items turned into 1 ceramic piece and one belt turned into a leather body armor. I wish I new about this feature back in the 90's I probably would have given this game more a chance.
 
Dosbox cycles matter. If your magic battles are going slow (as mine were) then use CTRL + F12 to increase cycles (12,000 + seemed to work for me) and CTRL + F11 to decrease cycles.

The game is great and holds up well I think. I love the different races and classes to choose from. The combat is excellent and starting you off in the arena as a tutorial of sorts is brilliant. When you get out into the desert and the world opens up its just fantastic to explore. I love the setting and a lot of the stories that you encounter are really good. The game is definitely set up for you to be the ""Good guy saviour of the wastes type of guy but there are plenty of evil ways to finish the quests also.""

Personal Favorite Team. I like running the thief as the main character so that all the options they have will readily appear. I almost didn't go with a thief at all but as my primary character I seem to be getting better random loot. Went with Ranger instead of Fighter or Gladiator because of the no penalties to duel wielding. Melee combat is extremely powerful and the mutliclass system doesn't seem to have many limitations. It's kind of like going into combat with 4 rangers, 3 clerics, 2 preservers and 1 thief. 

Half Elf - Ranger / Preserver / Thief
Thri-Kreen - Cleric / Ranger / Psionic
Half-Giant - Ranger / Cleric
Elf - Preserver / Cleric / Ranger

The game is clunky and if you specialize (meaning you only pick one class) then you might find yourself having a hard time with the final battle and the next game if you decide to try that option. Or at least that's what happened to me. Couldn't figure out what was going on and saw that most people use multiclasses online. Having tried multiclasses out I find that it's definitely the way to go.

I remember as a kid playing the game as 4 half giants with different classes. I might try that again on my next playthrough. I also didin't realize that there was a huge underground temple that connected a lot of the maps together until literally the end of the game so something to look forward to next time. Also, having played through it a few times now I really enjoy the ""random encounters"" you come across. Not sure how many there are exactly, and there's one with a druid where you collect butterflys that I haven't found yet. Not sure if you need to be a specific class ... any help is welcome.",0,1
"It's decent fun. I've got tons of hours from 100%'ing it (just about to at the time of writing the review). It's not that it's a bad game, but it's very devoid of real content. The gameplay loop isn't bad, but it's pretty bland right now.  What does this game need? I think it needs a better progression curve. It needs some secondary form of progress. Maybe a way we can dump gold into minor stat upgrades? Maybe every 1,000 monster kills is a 1% damage upgrade? I'm not sure what exactly is the answer, but there needs to be more meat to the game. Just getting to pick 3 towers each time, the limited skill points available at the end game without sinking thousands of hours, and the abrupt ending of the buyable skills from both gold and xp leaves you wanting more but with nothing in sight.

I really do hope this game gets more, because it's a good skeleton, but that's exactly what it is in current state. I'm a big idle game lover, so I hate to write a bad review, but I have to be honest as well.",1,0
"Some innovative things, but still a RPG-Maker game at the end of the day.

The first thing to mention is that the game was created using RPG Maker, a well-known tool for generating similar games. If you've ever played something like this, you'll know what to expect. Combat is turn-based, generic and slow. The main problem with these games is a lack of innovation in terms of graphics, user interface, and even story.

It's a rip-off of any JRPG out there. Every game has the same assets, character pictures, control system, and constraints, such as poor resolution and hidden buttons that might cause the game to crash without warning. 

If you can look past the warning above, you’ll find a very strange game. It’s very hard to place it in a specific genre because there’s a bit of everything. The first thing you’ll notice is that, with the exception of basic ground and wall textures, everything has some kind of interaction. Most is obvious and you will either examine things or talk to people, but there are also trees you can knock down, patches of earth that le you plant things, flowers and many other things.

The unique thing is connected to NPCs. Everyone has something to say, perhaps they have a quest, they might join your party or you might even kill them. Bad actions have consequences to your karma, which apparently has no effect on the gameplay. Sometimes it’s fine to do something bad. Stealing, for instance, will give you something good and increase your thieving skills. Killing people also isn't bad because you'll have a lot of fun with necromancy skill.

There are a bunch of skills you can increase by simply doing things. They resemble those from survival games, but here you don’t need to worry about eating or sleeping. There’s crafting, which is important for creating useful items such as axe for cutting down trees and torches for dark locations, foraging, cooking and several others. 

The interface is the worst element of the entire experience. To check stats, craft, or do anything else, you need the proper skill from the inventory, which takes you to a new screen. To exit that screen, choose the skill from the inventory again. It's a mess.

The game has a lot of achievements. Except for the hassle you need to go through to see them, they're actually quite good because they're organized by region and include hints on how to obtain them.",0,1

"Loved when Yohane said ""It's Yohaning time"" and Giran'd over everyone

Riko's still the best girl

[b]ACTUAL REVIEW:[/b]

I'm in a weird spot with this game, because while I did enjoy myself, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone who isn't familiar with the characters whatsoever. You go into this either completely familiar with the cast, or you weren't interested at all to even consider playing. Plus the price point is a bit too steep, as it's only 8 hours without much replayability. I'd say wait for a bigger sale if you're on the fence, but if you're a diehard LL/Yohane fan, you'll probably enjoy it and probably already own it.

The game itself is a straightforward dungeon-crawler with some light roguelike elements, but that's kind of a gimmick in itself, as you go into it and get out relatively soon. Each dungeon has their own rogue sections but it ends as soon as it's over. The bosses themselves are a mix of interesting, annoying, time-consuming and ""how in the hell am i supposed to beat this boss?"" You get each of the accompanying girls in each of the dungeons and travel back to earlier ones to find their upgrades. Some of them are useful...while some of them are not at all. All I'm saying is [spoiler] why the hell is Dia's so useful? It's a 3 slash attack that doesn't use much DP and attacks in quick succession, even to the point where you can just keep dishing out about 75+ damage in a single attack. Keep spamming it and you'll rack it up, it's stupid useful. [/spoiler]

But yeah, solid game if you're a hardcore Yohane fan, but not as worthwhile if you're not interested in the characters. Even the story's not a saving grace.

Also, Riko actually is the best girl. All's im sayin",0,1

"Generally good map, absolutely beautiful, but really needs QoL improvements. For me the biggest problem is the realms. The base map is Midgard, from which you can teleport to the 3(?) other realms, but the in-game map stays as the map of the Midgard realm. It's very confusing, and honestly makes the map kind of useless in the other realms unless you're using it to get your general location/GPS coordinates.

I would much prefer the map be dynamic and change to the map of the realm you are in, or make it like the Genesis 1 map where all of the ""realms"" (same concept) on shown on one map and have coordinates based on the overall map. There are numerous other QoL fixes needed, like overspawning of particular creatures in some areas (Gachas and Gasbags to name two that I've seen).

I'll probably give this expansion a thumbsup in the future if they make some QoL changes, especially something with the map to reduce the confusion with the realms.",1,0

"""Meh"" or ""ugh"" would be the appropriate improvisatorial adjective here.

This game is pretty contrasting in the things it does well and poorly in my opinion. The good are all the bits where it attempts to be simple, whereas the mediocre are everything else. 

The enemies are the highlight in this game; they're simple and follow a distinct pattern that requires the player to deal with them in a unique way. Because they're simple yet quite expressive fighting multiple at once feels quite good and dynamic. They hazards are generally well communicated too, like incoming strikes having a clear recognizable particle cue. Unfortunately the game suffers a bad case of the ""just run by them"", which is addressed in the small arena sections. The latter are consequently also the most challenging part of a run.

Then comes the core gameplay loop, which starts strong but starts to deteriorate in its confusion really rapidly. You have your standard melee strike and a ranged option which empties a resource generated by the first. Simple formula. Worked in the past, works here. You also have a dash with some i-frames and a perfect ""evade"" when close to the enemies' active frames. Again proven formula, works well. On top of that the player has two forms of consumables and an ability on a cooldown. Here things start to show the first signs of deterioration in the design. The game offers ZERO urgency outside the arenas, which means cooldowns are *rewarding* defensive and slow playing. You have the original ""ranged option only available when first getting into melee combat"" copied, which is designed exactly to battle this issue, and then you make the mistake anyway with abilities on cooldowns? Remarkable.

The consumables don't really compliment the game and feel more like a ""free out of jail""-card. I'm unsure what exactly was intended with them but they're fairly bland.

The melee combat feels BAD. Like actually outright bad. Animations are way slower than they should be, making the game feel unresponsive and clunky. But worse yet: weapons have massive deadzones. The most obvious examples are the weapons that have *no upward strike*. I complained about this in the demo and instead of fixing it they added it as ""roguelite element"" (further reinforcing what absolute cancer this genre is to indie developers). The consequences are that some enemies fall perpetually in the players deadzone, forcing them to awkward hop around and try to hit them with a directional attack that isn't suited for the job. Flying enemies and those sticking to the geometry are a nightmare to fight because of this.

Then there are the roguelite elements. This is the part where we go beyond bad in my opinion. The roguelite elements manifest themselves twofold: linear progression by collecting resources and crates containing upgrades and weapons. The first are part of the hub area, the latter lootboxes you can find in the map. Both of them are extremely invasive to the pace of the game. Just cleared a room with a lot of flair and speed? Hold up, gotta investigate this loot-box and pick my random boon for a minute. Momentum gone. And it happens constantly. Hub areas pretty much always suck so I don't really need to explain myself there. They're just an inferior menu to waste more time than necessary.

Because the game needed linear progression for whatever reason the maps sport a wealth of resources used for meta-progression. Resources in the form of coins and upgrade orbs. Some lootboxes contain an option: a meta-progression blue orb or something you would actually want to make the game fun? Brilliant. Punish the player for having stupid meta progression.

But the game goes even further by making the boons, random small perks you can obtain, extremely poorly designed. Almost a third of the boons I've seen REWARD bad playing. ""You get hit you get X"", ""if an enemy hits you you get Y"". WHY? Why REWARD the player for not playing the game properly? Even by roguelite standards this is dumb, and that's a big insult in my eyes.

The whole game is just another shining example of roguelites being perceived as this free ""look mom i designed a game xd""-crutch that indie developers fall for by the dozen. Almost everything bad about it originates from the fact that it didn't just double down on the fundamentals. It had to be another crappy roguelite, because indies must make roguelite games.

"To give the cliffs notes I think this is a really good game, but it has too many small issues and annoyances here and there that make he hate it in the long run. 

[b]The good parts[/b]

I'm gonna start of with the great parts. This game has wonderful graphics and music. The animation is superb, and there's even a nice combo system in here. The arcade mode is pretty short and punchy. you could probably do it in 30-45 minutes assuming you don't have too much trouble. 
[hr][/hr]

[h1]Here's where I have problems. [/h1]

first issue I had as soon as I booted up the game is that I can't assign my own buttons in the config menu. There's about 15 different control profiles, but not an option that let me directly change my own buttons. I tend to use my fightstick for as many games as i can. So it's important that I'm able to change my buttons as I please. I wanted to map the four main buttons to [b]A,B, RT, and LT [/b], but the predetermined settings only changed the face buttons. some macros are mapped to the shoulders and triggers, but i had no control over that. 

Gameplay wise there was just alot of small minor details that added up to being a big problem overall that affected my experience. Here's an abridged list

* the grappler's dropkick isn't active the entire time he's airborne
* His throws aren't a good crowd control option, and you can be left open after doing them and not knocking anyone down. 
* You can't dash at the edge of the screen (this cost me the killing blow on a boss)
* Hitboxes are weird in annoying ways
* at the end of pre boss segments, the game instantly teleports you to the boss, so there's no rest period to get food before the boss. 
* this is probably a skill issue, but the block button seems nearly useless. Most blockable attacks are easily dodgeable, and the hard to dodge attacks are unblockable. 

There's also the issue that some unlockable are gated by beating arcade with specific characters, which I generally don't have a problem with, but can be off putting to ppl that don't want to put in more time learning another character. 

There was probably some other things, but these are the main gripes that threw me off as a fan of the beat em up genre. I think if you wanna get this on sale or something go for it, but it's not good at the level that I'd earnestly recommend it to someone. If it seems like your thing go for it.",1,0

"Now before I go on with this review I just want to say I really love what I am seeing here. The game is really fun to play even with its flaws at the moment due to it being an early game. However I do have some concerns regarding the game and for some of the missions its a little difficult to tell where you are supposed to go or where your objective is. Is there a map you could implement, waypoint marker or world indicators like signs, roads or compass to use to better navigate the world? The first mission is a good example of this due to it lacking any indication of where you are supposed to go.  Another concern and this one is really important which is a pause menu. I pressed every button and I was unable to return to the menu to switch to a different activity. 

I have no plans of refunding this game as I am genuinely interested of where this game is going. Keep up the great work :D

To make it clear, in the demo every pice of equipment have their own skill respective to it's category, yet some do possess skills that make stats, lvl and rarety redundant since their active or even passive effects are just in a whole other league.

"It's ok.
I don't care about the civ changes to the Persians or the architecture changes. They're nice but it's not what I want to talk about.

This is an ok DLC campaign expansion. You've got three campaigns with five missions each. You've got some nice throwbacks with old AoC characters which I appreciated (even if they're traitorous snakes). Beautiful map designs, great voice-acting. Those areas of this DLC I have absolutely zero issue.

But, you are not going to be challenged at all by the AI in this expansion. I ran through on Hard and by the time this game released to this review a couple days later all three were beaten by attack moving 30-40 cav at a time to the objective. 

Maps are resource rich, you will never suffer for gold or stone. Your losses mean nothing and with all the gold laying around you're never going to be punished for throwing your men away. You can quite literally make any unit you want in these campaigns available to you and just tidal wave that one unit every mission in all three campaigns. 

AI rarely attacks and when it does it's reminiscent of AoK ai. Minimal waves spread out with anywhere a dozen to two dozen units per wave. 

Some missions were nice, and should have been historical missions so they could have been fleshed out, like the 4th Thoros mission (crestfallen waves). You load in tasked with clearing Byzantine docks around Cyprus while dealing with two enemy ais on Cyprus itself. You're given two allies but functionally just one doing anything. In between fending off the AIyou can theoretically raid the civilian inhabitants to get extra resources. Big map, lots of enemies, theoretically it'll be a challenge to defend yourself on land and go on the water to finish the objective..right?

Wrong, AI rarely attacks you or your AI companion. Naval AI occasionally sends fire ships to your docks. It's quite literally make 10-15 galleons and 2-3 dromon and finish the mission in fifteen to twenty minutes. IT started off looking amazing and then felt incomplete as I played through it. This feeling is on every single mission in this DLC.

I don't know what happened with the developers here or if one or two were working on each campaign, but I think it would have been better to just have one or two campaigns that had actual depth versus the three ""wide  and as deep as a puddle"" campaigns that we have currently.

For what it is and the price it is, Immortal Mantis is [i]fine.[/i] I enjoyed it enough but retrospective thought about following factors let me to conclude I've played a lot greater for free.

Starting with the key positives, the visuals are striking-- not anything too unique but still very good and just seeing how things played out was enough of a motivator to get me to brush past the frustrating parts of this game. The sound and music was also pretty good at conveying the mood and key moments, but also kind've results in an underwhelming experience come the end of it's short run.

Which leads to the negatives, the graphics while enticing often contributed to frustration-- at least personally when figuring out what to do, interact with, or where to go. Very often small things are located in small spaces, often only a few pixels easily missed indicating a critical item / object needed for progression.

The 'main' puzzle, or at-least the one that arguably requires the most brain-work (and is necessary for progression,) required too much trial and error with not enough indication / communication as to how the puzzle worked, nothing helped with indicating whether what you were doing was working or failing and as such I was left in confusion navigating the house making sure I had checked everything and trying to think outside the box to no avail. I eventually pieced it out-- but it definitely took some back and forth and trial and error.

In retrospect the puzzles weren't too complicated but it made the first play-through a tad frustrating alongside small little 'I'm stuck' type moments. The path taken to reach the alternate ending also could've been better communicated as the initial hook / 'clue' to get you on the path is so obscured it feels almost by chance you'd find it naturally.

The story too I wasn't able to piece together, maybe I was missing details or needed to organise everything inside my head or on a document to figure out the greater narrative but the explanation for who the mantis was or why things were happening the way they were fell short on my understanding and contributed to that feeling of dissatisfaction upon finishing.

Overall the game is still worth a shot and recommending as such, especially considering the price (you're not losing much), but it feels like one of the many free games you'd find on the Haunted PS1 Collections or Dread X-- where it arguably would've been better value alongside stronger titles.

[spoiler]It also might be worth the developer re-branding, as the name BitLife is often associated with a mobile game, making it a tad difficult to find and support their future endeavours.[/spoiler]",0,1

"Snips & Snails is an otome game centered around a college student (nameable by the player, default Lacy) in a contemporary/urban fantasy world where supernatural beings—known as ""Arcane"" or ""Arcs""—have recently become officially known to humans and now freely intermingle after a long period of secrecy. Most of that background doesn't affect the MC much, though, with the story largely centered around her interactions with the Alatars, a family of Arcs whose sons (mage Sullivan, vampire Quinn, and incubus Yuuto) all happen to attend the same college she does. (There's also a fourth LI, Eryck, the ghost who ""haunts"" the Alatar residence.) Major side characters include the MC's dad and her best friend Arabella, the latter of whom also grows closer to one of the boys.

The story is fairly straightforward romance, with the MC getting closer to the guy of your choice, plus a subplot involving mysterious dreams that the MC starts having. Each route has a good ending and a neutral/bad ending, as well an unlockable epilogue and bonus story. There are also optional text-only sex scenes (no explicit images, text roughly as explicit as the average print romance novel).

So, let's start off with the good things:

- The art is nice, especially the CG art.

- There are interesting things about the setting and worldbuilding. Even though generally Snips & Snails trends much more heavily towards slice of life than fantasy, for the most part I don't really feel like the fantasy elements have been wasted (which tends to be an issue with fantasy slice of life).

- The sex scenes are optional, with no game penalty for choosing not to read through them.

- There are a couple other not-story-affecting choices that I appreciated having (whether or not MC is a virgin, whether or not she drinks alcohol) just for story flavor purposes.

- [spoiler]Thanks for making the cute vampire bi, even if it only comes up at the end of a route that's not his, and his boyfriend's identity kind of makes the plot of a third route fall apart if you think about it[/spoiler]

Unfortunately...

- The writing just isn't very good. It reads like someone's first attempt at writing a story—and if it were just that it would be a commendable attempt. But this is a commercial game; you have to pay money to play it.

- The script does not appear to have been edited or proofread in any way; besides the fact that there's nobody listed as an editor or proofreader in the credits, there are frequent typos and places where characters say things that sound extremely unnatural or awkward (where it doesn't make sense for them to seem unnatural/awkward). When the writing is the primary focus of the game, it [b]needs to be treated as such[/b], not as an afterthought like this feels.

- The sex scenes in particular are extremely awkward—not just in writing, but also in staging. Because there are no CGs there, instead you get to see the LI's half-naked sprite do absolutely nothing through the whole scene (where the text makes it clear that he's very much not doing absolutely nothing). A black screen as the background would genuinely be preferable; just having the bedroom background with no sprites would work too.

- The game itself feels stiff. Sprites rarely move when it seems like they should, keeping the same expression for long periods of time. There are conversations that go on and on with none of the characters on screen moving in any way. I'm not asking for the developer to go so far as to include animations or Live2D, those absolutely aren't necessary for a good VN, but just having the sprites regularly change expression and/or move across the screen can do a lot for engagement.

- The game's hero banner spoils every CG in the game (and by extension a major plot point). This is a relative nitpick, but if you're someone who doesn't like having CGs spoiled, it might be an annoyance.

In all, while there is some potential here, ultimately Snips & Snails falls flat in its most important area, and thus I can't recommend it. While the visual issues are inconsequential enough that I could overlook them in a better-written game, the script would need a massive overhaul or total rewrite in order to get to a level that I could recommend spending money on it. With all that said, there [i]is[/i] enough potential here that, with practice and editing, I could definitely see this developer release a quality VN in the future!

"The DLC itself is fun, I like the new characters, I love the fact they added a sniper weapon that is literally just A Brick You Throw, but damn man the devs really need to add actual content to the game. The DLC gives you a new way to replay content that's been in for ages without adding anything new, even just new room layouts for existing zones (tilesets) let alone entirely new zones to actually add variation. In games like Risk of Rain 2 you at least get the variation of 2 possible zones to visit per stage, but in this game you will ALWAYS play the same area in every game stage, and I really feel like that holds it back. If you enjoy the game & want to support the devs then i can recommend the DLC, but if you want something-- anything-- truly new in the game then this DLC simply doesn't do enough to accomplish that goal. So if you want to hit catfish men in the face with a brick, this is the DLC for you! If you want anything more than that, save your money for when they release an actual level pack.

"As much I really like when Gunfire drops a new content to mess with it for couple more hours. I like and hate this DLC 

You gain 2 new Heroes, Owl and Raccoon also 4 new weapons for a really low price like in previous DLC. 
BUT
Like in DLC1 most of the weapons are f*cking dogsh*t :
- Brick is a really powerful weapon in the Sniper category being one of the best early game weapon for all characters and mid-endgame weapon for Lei Luo (Tiger) 

- Jet Octopus it's another Injector that you would skip/sell every single time you see it. I like the idea by tickling enemies and using Alt-Fire to do massive damage BUT meter that you need to full in for that ALT-Fire takes too long and takes your ammo by making you pretty much useless on the field 

- Wolf Gaze we finally got a new SMG since Scalpel was added 2 years ago. Shortly another cool looking automatic weapon that really really suck d*ck

- Star Ring f*cking sucks and it's really clunky to use 

Heroes :
- Zi Xiao (Owl) by just messing around a little bit looks like a really cool endgame character but the amount of the really stupid information really hurts your brain and you don't even know what you're doing. As the early-midgame 3-5/10 as the lategame 7-8/10

-Nona (Raccoon) really fun character to play a bit squishy, but the thing that you can build around the Robot making him you're Meat Shield and some sort main DPS source is really fun and feels fresh 

Free stuff and update :
As usual they added tons of the cool scrolls for free, little changes to some gemini's and inscriptions.
No buffs for weapons that scream ""BUFF ME"", I'm looking at you SMG and Assault Rifle category
In DLC1 characters were ok but new weapons are a lackluster. 

Otherwise for that really low pricetag you can still spend more time in the game mess around with the new stuff

"Tl;dr: Only buy this game if you have played other Etrian Odyssey games and loved them, as this game is IMO the most frustrating in the series. If you are not particularly fond of this franchise, skip EO2 HD and get EO3 HD instead (or other mainline EO entries if you can get them). I repeat, if you are a series newcomer, please don't play this as your first EO.

Etrian Odyssey is a hardcore and traditional DRPG series which excels at two things: 1) Immersing the player in a fantasy world centered around the world tree Yggdrasil; and 2) Providing the player with satisfying turn-based combat including difficult combat puzzles that encourage creativity and player expression. I would say that the former point is how EO lure in new players, while the latter point is what makes players stick around. Unfortunately, EO2 has some issues in delivering these two things to the player.

On one hand, EO2 is particularly good at player immersion due to having a lot of events scattered in its labyrinth, making the world feel more alive and exciting to explore (for series veterans, I would say the density of events feels higher compared to its predecessor or even some of the later games like EO4 and EON). Even though there isn't a colorful cast of main characters or a strong plot like in a traditional JRPG, these adventure episodes (as EO5 calls them) help make the exploration much more memorable. 

On the other hand, this increase in events also led to one of the issues unique to EO2 - excessive backtracking/grinding. Many events require a specific class to solve, and even though these events are not mandatory, they frequently gatekeep optional areas of the labyrinth. Therefore, players will experience frustration of not being able to resolve an event and the fear of missing out on good items in the optional area. This either (was my case the first time I played this game on 3DS) demotivated them from playing, or (was my case the second time I played this game on Steam) forced players to grind up characters to see what's locked behind the events. To me, neither of these two experiences was positive. This issue extends to the sidequests in this game, which often required grinding up new characters to solve. Personally, I think the negative experiences I described above is why these class-exclusive events are basically extinct in the later games.

The combat of EO2 also feels a bit weaker than the combat of other EOs. Namely, I feel that the player do not have much agency in EO2 compared to in other games. In this game, the enemies have very potent AOE attacks (Stratum 4 comes to mind), but the two defensive classes you have both work randomly, so you may lose important party menmbers out of blue. This might push you to build your party more offensively, aiming to finish encounters before they get out of hand, but the accuracy formula in this game makes attacks miss more often than in other EOs, so one of your enemies can just survive and wipe your entire party after your offense. If that's not enough randomness for you, there's also blindsides (enemy go first), which combined with some formations will just send you to the game over screen before you get to move. These things combined makes EO2 combat very stressful and makes the player feel bad because they are not in control.

There's also the experience curve change - all minibosses (generally used as puzzle pieces in dungeon puzzles) in this game do not give experience points (they do in all other EO games). The developers' intention were probably to push players to actually solve dungeon puzzles by disincentivizing removal of puzzle pieces by combat, but it has the side effect of removing a good grinding method, thus it reduced players' incentive to try out different classes and builds because they cannot get experience points easily. The decision to tinker with one element of the game sadly undermined another, more central part of the game.

I can still go on about other issues of this game (like how its loot/drop system is not very good), but I will stop now because I fear this review will make this game look really bad when in fact EO2 is way better than a lot of other RPG games out there. The reason I do not recommend you to play this has more to do with the other EOs being better than this game being so-so. To me, EO2 feels like an unfortunate result of developer experimentation, much like Zelda 2 or Castlevania 2. The base gameplay is robust, it is just that a lot of good intentions and great ambitions ended up making the game worse in other ways. Finally, even though these experiments ended badly for EO2, I don't want to discourage creativity in game development (or anything really), because creating something new and good is never easy.",1,0

Cruise Ship Horse Racing (CSHR) is a wagering simulator billed as simulating pseudo horse races that were made by rolling dice and moving wooden horses. Apparently, this was a popular pastime on old cruise ships where voyages were not filled with swimming pools, discos, and theaters. CSHR is a very simple game with a busy presentation. There isn’t a lot of game to CSHR, it could be easily made by a high school student in a few hours, minus the pretty facade. The player starts with $100 and makes bets on horses by number, with payouts based on cumulative bets made by other hypothetical passengers on the voyage. If the player is repeatedly lucky calling the win, place, or show, the $100 could be parlayed up to some greater amount. 

CSHR is played with the mouse and its only use is to click buttons for selecting the horse number, wager amount, win/place/show, start race, etc. There are no graphic options; the sound is only capable of being turned down or off. The music and all sound effects are tied together, so the music is always on if the sound is on. The music is a big band style sound, that goes with the theme, but is too loud by default. There isn't any save game option; however, the game does appear to auto-save as starting the game resumes where the last game left off.

The layout or presentation of CSHR is not bad, but it is a bit confusing at first. There are only a couple of screens, but the main screen, which displays the odds and allows the player to make the bets, is oddly laid out. It is as if the developer wanted to use every bit of screen real estate possible, so it is very busy to look at.  As far as actual game play, there is little to do. Make a bet, click 'Run Race' and watch the race. Fortunately, there is a speed up button during the race as it will get tedious to watch, it goes up to 2x speed. For some reason the developer decided to add a 0.5x speed option, slowing the already slow race to a crawl. A 10x speed would be a welcome option, and also making it persist so that it doesn't have to be re-selected during every race. 

CSHR will likely run on pretty much any PC made in the last 10 years or more, it doesn't appear to have any bugs. The graphics look fairly well made, and the sound is reasonable. The problem with CSHR is that it's a one race horse; there's no there, there. It is unlikely that old Cruise ships were running these races all day long, every day of the voyage, because it's not all that fun to make bets until all of the money has been exhausted from the wallet. There is no way to win or beat this game, the iron law of statistics means the player will eventually lose everything in the wallet, no matter what strategy is employed. Even if the player were to have a long winning streak, there is nothing else to do other than make more bets. [b]There is about $2 and 10 minutes worth of game in Cruise Ship Horse Racing; it is not recommended for more than that.[/b]",1,0

"04OCT23 Review

This DLC seems to be the 'success' that PGI has been needing for a while. That being said, I still recommend you buy this on sale as PGI still only released a slim-budget product. All real effort went into the 15x Mission Campaign.

The specific items:
Campaign - This is one of the better campaigns I have experienced.  The starting 'Mechs are a great mix, weapon and 'Mech market availability is good, starting inventory is well-established, starting money makes you have agency, but not able to fund a whole new line-up. Missions are decently laid out and engaging. Story/Lore is a great peek at ComStar feeding the Kuritans against the FedCom Alliance with more entwined story pieces. This is a particular win for the Lore-Junkie-'Mech-Jockeys. Somehow, this is the best part.

Battlemechs: 5x Longbow, 6x OTOMO Variants of other Chassis.

Longbow - A Great Back-Line Missile Support 'Mech. All 5x variants are materially the same. Some will just have more Laser slots. Other than that, big hit box 'arms' to make sure your missile launchers are hit. This is extremely lazy and could have been augmented with another 'Mech release. I like me a Missile-boat, but come on.

Otomo - Essentially Kuritan Royal Guard Variants with all the awesome LosTech upgrades you could want. In Vanilla MW5:Mercs, that means you just have a standard weapon load with max-ish armor, a bunch of Heatsinks (doubles mainly) and Ammo slotted. I consider these variants essential demi-hero-'Mechs, which point for point, probably could out perform their Hero-Variant counter-parts. No doubt, Modders will vary this up more with internals, engine sizes, and other sweet gear to make these variants be more descriptive and enjoyable to customize.

Free Update - Instant Action fight arena with friends and teams. This could be better completed by redoing MW4 Solaris Arena, making it a mode with George Ledoux as Duncan Fisher narrating arena events. Ultimately, not a 'Free Update', more like, ""We added a feature you probably did not know about"".

Again, in summary: Buy on Sale; Campaign - Good 'nuff; Longbow - Lazy Yawn; Otomo - Hero-contenders; Free Update - Where?",1,0

edit:
For the developer. Here's some feedback:
Firstly, the game needs some optimisation work. I don't have the greatest computer around but it should certainly be able to run the game better.

There were also a lot of issues with vehicles. I think I was only able to actually drive one (a tractor) but all the others would freak out and start bouncing around the moment I tried to enter them. There was also an instance were I was teleported a bit away after entering one.

Some other issues I had:
- The default volume is way too loud (and if I remember correctly, there wasn't a way to change the volume once you are in a match)
- The 3D audio seemed to have a really long fall off range, so vehicles that were really far away sounded as though they were right next to me",1,0

"A cool concept, and I appreciate there being an exploration mode without monsters. Though I find the gameplay a little frustrating with searching for random mementos. When searching for the power switch, key, and hatch, it’s easy to know what to look for, but when searching for mementos, it gets to the point where you’re searching the entire map and hovering over every single mundane object to see if a prompt appears above it. If the mementos were at least consistent, or we had some way of knowing what to look for, that would improve the gameplay a lot. I’ve been searching for every inch of the airport for its memento for an hour and I still haven’t found it.",1,0

"91 minutes. That was enough to read every word, see all three ""endings,"" and take a short phone call in the middle of it all.

For $5 I wasn't expecting an epoch.

The ""story"" is kinetic. there is only one choice, and even then it's simply which of the 3 love interests the MC is gonna see naked. So, save your game then and there, because it's headed back to the main menu shortly after.

As for the text boxes, I liked what was there. There were some typos, but overall, the English seemed to be written by a native speaker. It could be a translation, but if so it was very competently done.

I'm NOT saying that this is some profound tale that you simply MUST read. It is a short story about a young man trying to be one thing, and then finding out that it might be better to be something else. But it was kind of humorous watching him fail miserably.

I wonder if a woman wrote (or translated) this. Not that there is any feminist bullshit in here, but it just feels more the product of a feminine mind than a masculine one.

Each of the three girls are pretty. They look like realistic young women. Not escapees from the porn set. No girls with tits that enter the room 6 minutes before the rest of her. No 50 year old women that look 16. A refreshing change of pace in the porn genre.

As far as the sex scenes go, you will see 2 per ending. More or less anyway. Personally, I don't really think of a blowjob as ""sex,"" but I guess oral sex is still sex. Anyway, there is a blowjob, and then a sex ""scene"" with the chosen girl. I put ""scene"" in quotes, because while there IS movement, I can't really call it animated.

The movement is more like 4-6 frames where the body positions change. It's not 5 frames of a cock penetrating a pussy. It's more like 5 frames where the girl starts out in ""cowgirl"" and ends up ""hugging"" the MC. It's an artistic choice that I have derided in other games, but here it works. Probably BECAUSE it's not just a choppy close-up of genitalia.

The soundtrack is actually quite good. It's a bluesy clean guitar for the most part. And it just ties the scenes together. It loops, but the game isn't really long enough for it to become tedious.

Anyway, it's not very long. It's not really animated. It doesn't really have any choices. Quite often, that would be a refunded game on my end. However, I liked this little VN. If those things don't bother you, then I can confidently say that you will probably like this. If they do bother you, then it really is a coin toss as to whether or not you will enjoy this.

[b]legendary slide[/b] is a mahjong-based sliding game from 2016. gotta move individual pieces around until they can meet, match and disappear. it's just like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/1070250/]notes[/url] or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/1501090]yin yang[/url] on steam but there are probably other examples that escape me at the moment.

[b]93 levels[/b] unlocked one by one, divided into numerous packs within numerous packs. optional animated [b]tutorials[/b] teach the rules over and over, as the same one plays before every single level. can be turned off but then you might miss new info later. because of course there are [b]various mechanics[/b], not always explained, so I guess you won't be missing anything. not a huge deal, leaves something to find out for yourself. ice tiles are static, sand disappears if conditions are met, locks need keys, there are portals, arrow tiles, 'hidden' ones that need clicking to reveal for a second what they are, etc.

controls are mouse-based, work as they should, esc brings up the pause menu, no other hotkeys. [b]no timer or move limit[/b], just a [b]3-star rating system[/b] based on the number of matches. remove everything for a perfect rating but [b]the final pair to finish the level with only gets revealed (randomly from the remaining tiles) after reaching 2 stars, so it's impossible to finish any level with a single star[/b]. what's the point of the whole system then?

there's a counter for remaining tiles and a toggle to show movable ones. [b]what's missing is a next level button[/b] on the level complete screen, continue just drops you back at level select where there aren't level previews or numbers, so that isn't done well either.

so far so good enough but [b]no undo in a sliding game is a total dealbreaker[/b], made even worse here by [b]no reset button[/b] either. have to bring up the menu and do it there, then wait a bit until things slowly reset.

since it's the [b]platinum edition[/b], not only does it come with more levels (only 84 in the butchered version on big fish), but [b]video solutions are available for every stage[/b], turning a 100 mb game into 1 gb. there's a seek bar and pause button, good stuff, but [b]since the final tiles are randomly chosen, the solution might not work 100%[/b], e.g. if it shows to match 2 tiles next that became finishers in your game. the walkthrough selection screen has layout previews and level numbers at least, and [i]that[/i] has a dedicated button on the ui while playing too. there are possibly other extras, unlocked after completing the main levels, which I didn't bother with the way the game works.

it [b]looks exactly like the developer's other mahjong titles[/b], same menus, ui, tiles, everything. possibly the same audio as well, can't confirm that. customization options are pretty good though, backgrounds, tilesets, tile shapes and colors. separate volume sliders, game cursor and windowed mode make up the settings, available anytime, plus there are player profiles.

would be a fine little game despite all the recycled assets (just look at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/701290/]legendary mahjong[/url], which also has slide levels that may or may not differ from the ones here, lots more content for about the same price), but as said above, [b]no undo means it can't be recommended[/b]. bummer.",1,0

Beat it in about an hour.  It is indeed a chapter zero.  The controller didn't seem to actually have a defend button.  The map pages didn't change less you were running full speed ahead.

"DLC is fine on its own, nice addition to the game.

However, their implementation of NG+ kinda soured my whole experience with it. Granted, I started playing this game a couple weeks before DLC came out, and finished it the night before. So when I started up to play the DLC the next day, to be greeted with their obtuse implementation of NG+ was not fun. 

You can't NG+ unless you either
- Beat the final boss again on your current save file
- Beat the entire game on NG

Problem with the final boss beat thing, they changed the fight to make it more interesting, so I don't want to spoiler it after just beating it and remove all the buildup. 
And I didn't want to go through NG again.

Sadly, I decided to go through again on the Hard difficulty, got halfway through, and got burnt out. 

Now, they have released an update to make NG+ be playable from the getgo. Great, glad they did it. But it's a little late now, I've been burned by the wishy-washy implementation, and don't want to play again. Kinda bummed, kinda my fault for accidentally starting before the DLC came out. 

If you're just now starting the game, I'd recommend getting the DLC too. But man, I hope the Dancing Dragon Games learns from this and does better next time.",0,1

"wish there was a mix thumb for this one, cause this game i do like but at the same time there are foundation that is a bit frustrating 

randomize resource on die to make your building sounds fun until you are just missing 1 resource despite having multiple dice like 5 but you get none for straight 5 turns. another thing is that the game doesnt tell you what the enemies weakness, as in cc, the boss is immune cc but was never told to me in any way beside testing it which result in me losing my building in the process and my whole progress. another thing is that ai for the troops and building are comletely random as hell. i wish there was a priority system that way the ai can be tolerable but there isn't any at all, ai keeps focusing on minions instead of the boss in front of them. 

i would say despite my negativity, this game i could recommend if you can tolerate the randomness of ai

"With this review, I want to discuss all the positives and negatives of the game.

POSITIVES:
I like the new textures and the remodel of the Masked Man. Also, the starter room is cool.

NEGATIVES:
I don't like the concept that the lighter needs to be visible. It is more creepy if the player can't see it. Another thing I don't like about this game is the new remodel of the Red Mist Monster. Sorry, I meant to say SCP-173. I don't know why SCP-173 is replenishing the Red Mist Monster but this makes the game impossible to beat. So let me explain. In the normal SCP-087-B game, there are two types of behavior the Red Mist Monster will follow. First is the 173 behavior when he will move if you don't look at him. And he won't follow you to other floors. Second is the behavior when you choose the wrong hallway in the two hallways room. Then the Red Mist Monster will appear walking towards you trying to make you fall into the hole that doesn't even exist in the UE Remake. SCP-173 follows only the first behavior somewhat. I say somewhat because he won't stop following you even if you are on the different floor. Which makes the game impossible to beat.",1,0

This game is similar to hang man. The object of the game is to crack the word by guessing words  and hopefully finding out what the word is. It is a bit difficult to play if you are good at word games you will probably have no issues. It was fun to play for a bit but it is a bit repetitive and I found myself becoming bored of it after about 30 mins of game play. The price is good for this style game and I would recommend it to word buffs. I would give this a 5/10 because it doesn't hold interest for very long and is a bit too repetitive for me.,1,0

"A message to the DEVS:
1. Keep updating the game with more daily/weekly/monthly events + log in events with rewards to keep people wanting to play more.
2.Plan on improving game performance, as it has some lag spikes here and there.
3.The cyberpunk themed map is ok, but u should add more maps later on to unlock.

A message to the players:
--I understand the game's limitations, they are obvious so i will just tell u what the game is good for:
1. U farm exp, rebirth and can join a new race every 1-2 minutes.
2. Rankings/leaderboards are there to have fun trying to beat and there are personal records on each race map to improve.
3. Pets and stuff to evolve and lvl up, character leveling and rebirths (reset with extra boost).
--The game has bots, so u can do races as often as u like which is understandable, but it pretends it has players with names and u can even send friend request to the bots which is strange to say the least... I have not tried playing it with a friend yet,

TL;DR : game is overly simplified but has aspects that can potentially boost ur playtime as u can farm for stuff. Try the game urself and if it crashes on loading do file verification. I had some fun with it, even though it is what it is.",0,1

"Mixed feelings. I can feel the inspiration from a number of games I like (each flawed in their own way). This has the potential for a hidden gem, but it needs a lot of work. There's a significant lack of clarity. Mechanics aren't introduced well, the story jumps from one scene to the next without context, exploration has no clear direction for you to follow. Introducing a time mechanic but not telling us how to use our time effectively is a bad combo; you end up feeling frustrated because there's no feedback. QoL needs a TON of work, even simple things like pressing escape to exit popups do not exist. Everything feels just a little janky and atmosphere-breaking. Even sound design just isn't meshing together (though it's decent on an individual level). It's a game with potential, but whether it ends up as good or bad will be decided in the choices they make in EA.",0,1

For a small game the environment is well detailed. The oddest part isn't however, is the weird armband tool. It doesn't fit with the rest of the game. Environment 1950-ish, Tool 2020.",1,0

"This is a fun obstacle course 3D platformer with potential for competition with perhaps a few other players. You may want to be sure you have friends getting this game with you, as though it advertises as a multiplayer, it appeared to me to require friends on Steam to join your game, and there wasn't any multiplayer lobbies at all. Was not able to personally test the multiplayer feature, so cannot state what that would be like. There also appeared to be just one level, but this was a decent course to play on. Overall perhaps not that impressive, but it is a very affordable game, and not a bad price for the content.
The music really adds to the exciting feel of the game, motivating you to play on to victory - even if by yourself.

Themes:

Family friendly. Technically your 3D stick-figure character can ""die"" by the obstacles or by falling of the edge (expect this to happen often), but is re-spawned at the previous check point, and obviously there's nothing graphic.

Assuming you can get multiplayer happening, parents may wish to monitor communication, as online chat is available.

"Invicta is one of the prettiest broken games you will ever play. The mechanics are what you would expect for a top down hack n' slash, but the art team was pulling over time making it. The level up system is painfully slow and pointless to the point that I'm pretty sure it is a joke. The save is unreliable and the game's dalliances with the z axis makes me wonder if the devs have an irrational fear of cat-walks that they want to propagate amongst the rest of the world.

It is surprisingly difficult to die in combat in this game - in fact I only managed it once. But I died like 4 times due to a combination of glitches and the game's indecision on weather jumping down from cliffs is an option for exploration or a quick and easy way  to loosen up your joints after a long life. 

Also, boss fights are a joke. I saw three of them and one seemed to be completely optional. In fact you have nothing to gain if you do it and everything to lose if happen to (somehow) fail. The first boss was some off brand vesion of Barnie in his audition for Gladiator. Want to know what his attacks are? So would I - as he died before he did anything more than swing his axe around. I think he was supposed to be the prison warden, but I'm not convinced he wasn't just a senile old pensioner that I bullied to death.  That's not even mentioning that the key item he drop is so small and blends into the background that I didn't even realize he had dropen anything. And you NEED the item he drops because after beating him, it loops you back to the previous level and you need the item to proceed.

Then we have the final boss. Again. Looks and animates great - the art design was on point. But the boss isn't challenging or interesting and there isn't even an end to the fight. In fact, I don't think you even see him defeated - he just kind of raises his sword as if asking ""why isn't this working?"" and then the game ends. I mean, can't fault the strat - he can't lose if he ends the game before we kill him. I'm more impressed than anything..

In spite of that, I do recommend. The game is pretty enough to warrant a look. And the game *knows* it is pretty because it has multiple ""stop and look around"" sections. And any game that has the confidence to tell you to take a close look at its stitches deserves a hand for being so brave.",0,1
"While the game does function well enough, it is still a far better option to opt for the VR option. The only reason I would recommend the game would be more of a ""demo"" as to what features would be available in VR. 

The other issue between the games is the speed at which different actions occur. The locomotion of actions, such as loading torpedoes manually, are vastly different in speed. Additionally, the interactions measures often are difficult to manage between adjacent ones. For example: Opening a latch on a door vs pulling on the door are often difficult to differentiate. 

However, the true negative to the game is the lack of free-roam. This is the real bread and butter of the game, and is a key piece missing in the current form. While my opinion might improve slightly if it were added, I would still only suggest getting the game as more of a test/demo. 

The other point to consider is the online community for the game. While the game is clearly meant to be enjoyed with multiple people, you will often find it to be rather ""empty"". While the Non-VR game is new, the VR counterpart is not. Both have, at best, a fledgling online community, making multiplayer a rare encounter. Unless you have friends joining to play, I would caution expectations on that regard, instead viewing it more a solo-game.",0,1

"[h1][b]THE SHORT GAME OF THE PRINCESS[/b][/h1]
Sometime ago, i'm pretty sure I saw this game on DLsite or some other website, but I didn't bother picking up, though I couldn't quite remember why. After playing it briefly, I realized that i'm glad I didn't double-dip on this one-- it's a very short experience, and the difficulty lies in whether you choose to have Estelle lose her virginity or not. Anyway, let's begin this review.

[h1][b]THE STORY[/b][/h1]
The story in this game is basically laid out for you in the first few minutes of the game, the game's synopsis, and if you scroll down and look under story. How do I feel about the story? It's bland, like the majority of H games out there. It's not the first time this sort of premise has been used, and there's quite a few strategy games that employ this sort of plot device that you can pick up on DLsite if you scrounge around a little and look for SLGs.

[h1][b]THE GAMEPLAY[/b][/h1]
Pretty simple, you can move your units as many tiles as you want if they're your tiles(indicated in blue). Touching an empty red tile or trying to attack an enemy will end the turn of the unit that was moved, and if the enemy on a tile is defeated, you will capture the tile as well. Aside from that, I mostly found myself using the archer to chip away at enemies on first hit, deal damage with the soldier, and then finish off with mage. I almost never utilized the Knight or Armor Knight, and somewhat utilized the Guardian Dragon-- they do virtually no damage and cost too much to heal to be worth using.

Don't engage an enemy if it puts you in a point where 2 or more enemies can attack you at once, try to bottleneck them if you're having issues. As stated earlier, the game's difficulty lies in whether Estelle is a virgin or not, and there ARE endings tied to the state of her chastity. With how short the game is, learn the game by popping her cherry as soon as you can, then go for the virgin ending on the second run; the game's short enough, and easy to understand to do as such.

[h1][b]THE GRAPHICS/VISUALS[/b][/h1]
Aside from Estelle and the CGs, everything else, from backgrounds, to units, etc were stock assets in RPGmaker, Wolf Editor, and various other engines  that you can lift assets from.

[h1][b]THE AUDIO/BGM[/b][/h1]
Much like the graphics, everything is stock-standard stuff you can lift from various engines and websites, with the exclusion of Estelle's voice actress. In other words, basically nothing to write about, though I will admit that I enjoyed the vocal performance, it was pretty expressive in a good way.

[h1][b]THE H CONTENT[/b][/h1]
I have to say it every time I write a review for an H game:
This is the section all of you are interested in.
To summarize, it's mostly just PZR, Mouth stuff, non-con, and eventually consenting(mild corruption, I guess). There's a few tags that some might be interested in, namely Somnophilia and Hypnosis, but it's very light, and there's only like... 8 CGs with a few variations. The H content is light, in other words. If you're a complete freakin' weirdo like me and have been in the H game scene for over a decade, you'll definitely find this game's H content severely lacking(alongside the game itself...).

[h1][b]MY PERSONAL ENJOYMENT[/b][/h1]
I'll be honest, I was strongly considering filing for a refund. The game definitely isn't worth $8, especially with how long it is, but I played it long enough that I could consider it a ""minimum wage"" level game, so for what it's worth, if you consider game duration versus price, then it's priced properly.

The game itself wasn't very fun to play, and gave no explanation on how to actually play the game, but it's not difficult to understand. Did I enjoy it? No, not really, but it made an hour slide right by, so I guess it's somewhat okay, at best.

[h1][b]THE CONCLUSION[/b][/h1]
The Winning Secret of the Newbie Strategist Princess is kind of a pain to play, but there's definitely worse out there. If you want to be silly, you can probably just pick the game up, grab the adult patch from OTAKU Plan's website, and maybe get a quick fap, then refund the game after. The game's short enough to do all of that within the refund window.

[h1][b]THE VERDICT[/b][/h1]
[h1]3/10[/h1]
Skip this one, unless it's on sale for 50%(or more). I'm not cheap enough to refund a game I beat, but I will definitely say that the game is [b]NOT[/b] worth $8. The only reason why the score is as high as it is is because the vocal performance was entertaining, and Estelle's dobonhonkeroos are just about the right size for my weirdo tastes.",1,0

"I didn't have the greatest experience with this game. I understand it's a small studio and one of the first projects so take this review as a learning for future projects.

First of all i could not launch in windowed mode at all, the game just crashed when i tried. Fullscreen worked.
I ran the campaign and started the tutorial. The text was hard to read, (white text on white textured background) and i couldn't tell if i did everything right or wrong. The special units part didn't work therefore the tutorial could not be finished.

Also the building part is very hard to understand. I tried to build everywhere but it only said ""i could not build here"". Hunting traps worked on some places. In mission 3 i can't build anything at all.
To help you build you get a red circle where the building is placed, this circle stays red even where you can build. To make building easier this need to be changed so the ring gets green on places you can build. If you can't build on a mission then disable the option so we don't get confused.

If you make a game like this in the future i sure hope you use a better engine. I can see this would work but we need to be able to have better control of units and formations. Take a look at Mount & Blade and use that game as a  template.

Otherwise thumbs up. If this game was released around same time as Liero (late 90's) i would have loved to play it on the school breaks. :)",1,0

"Again a lovely theme, interesting gameplay and beautiful asthetics. Like always with Sokpop.

But also, again, plain horrible UI and control mechanics. I am unsure if the people at Sokpop are superhumans or use different input devices than humans but this game is unplayable.

- No shortcuts for the building menu. I have to click on every very little icon AND also return from every menu with the back arrow, which is more close to the middle of the screen
- When placing a building or picking up resources I cannot click the location. I have to walk there and keep the mouse button pressed while doing so. However during that the camera moves and my cursor position changes as the camera is always centered on the player character. The result is that you constantly miss where you wanted to build or gather.

If that gets reworked the game has potential. But atm it is unplayable.

Eagerly waiting for an update and looking forward to change my review then.

Disclaimer: I do have quite a large screen with a high resolution. I guess the accessibility is better in a lower resolution but still the core issues remain.",0,1

"It's fun and simple however there are some truly impossible levels in the mix. The type of levels where you either need a bubble, 3 jumps or some type of wall jumping ability to complete or get the star. I don't think it's a skill issue I think there is something actually missing on some levels. I honestly think it needs someone that developed it to replay through all the levels so they can either fix these issues or give tips for however you expected players to make those 3 jump high jumps. 

Despite the issues I really liked this game a lot. The walking sound and small details of the rabbit are adorable, the jumping sound isn't as pleasant to listen to though. 

TLDR?:
1.) There are some bugs. 
2.) The issue is with the map not the controls.

"I could really use an ""unsure"" recommendation option for this game, since I would still suggest trying it. It's free. Just don't set your expectations too high.

It's decent. A bit bland, but functional. Performs well, looks really nice, sounds pretty good. There is very little depth or variety to the gameplay though, most of it consists of strafing around enemies and using abilities when the cooldowns are done. There's not a whole lot of items to get, and the upgrade options are not very interesting.

I do understand it's a sort of demo, and I am just reviewing it as it is. I'm still looking forward to the full game's release.

Also, devs, please, the sprint button needs to go. There is literally no reason to not sprint when you're out of combat. It should automatically speed you up when you stop attacking. Having a mandatory button press every 2 seconds just to move faster and die less needs to stop being standard game design.",1,0
"One of those cool ""intuit what to do"" type games with no text and no real guidance, but it's admittedly a bit linear which does take away some of the exploration elements, unfortunately. The way the different puzzles interweave with each other is neat and the presentation is gorgeous, albeit I feel like the last puzzle set dragged way too long compared to the rest of the game. This feels like a small demo of what could be a much more involved game but for what it is, it's pretty cool - just, like, a bit short, as most all the Cosmos 9 games are.

As for the bundle as a whole... it really feels like a game jam that they're making you pay to play. Half the games are either tech demos or just feel... unpolished, and they're all a bit too far on the short side to be particularly engaging. And there's no real cohesion between the graphical design or the controls meaning the whole ""console"" gimmick doesn't really hold up. The whole set is definitely a bit overpriced and even at the 50% off price point I can't say it felt worth the time I spent with them all. 

If you do have to get any games in this pack, Triga is probably worth full price, Linelith and IFO are pretty cool albeit a bit underdeveloped and probably worth it on sale, and maaaaybe Tendy and Frequency Dissonance are worth it on sale but those are hard to recommend otherwise, and the other four are either too tedious or too underdeveloped to be even worth your time, so I'd give the bundle as a whole a pass.",0,1
"[b] *Received for free as I was an Early Access player* [/b]

[b] TL;DR: [/b]If you're low on money, you don't miss out on anything by not buying it.

The items are nice, but most are reskins of other very common in-game items and you'll be replacing them anyway a few hours in. They are only relevant for those who have played Larian's previous game, [i] Divinity: Original Sin 2[/i], as they are references from that game. The only actually useful item is the [i]Mask of the Shapeshifter[/i], which gives you free uses of the [i]Disguise Self[/i] spell (and the spell itself is not one you'd use that often).

The [i] ""Aventurer's Pouch"" [/i]can be sort of useful, especially if it's your first time playing, but, similarly to the D:OS2 items, you're probably going to be finding enough and better resources a few hours in (I didn't even use it). 

The dice reskin is just that, a dice reskin (and at first can be sort of confusing since they replace the '20' with the Larian Studios logo and the '1' with a Mind Flayer face). The paintings are more of ""unofficial collectibles"" since you find them hidden throughout the game, but can't really do anything with them until you've reached the city and rented out a room at the Elfsong Tavern (mid Act III).

The artbook is nice and shows a lot of interesting stuff; having the soundtrack in the other hand is great for easy access, but the average person can just find them on Youtube or Spotify anyway (the composer has his own channel / account).",0,1

Will write more when I've been through the game.

EDIT: Unfortunately, base mechanics and lack of functions made it more frustrating to play than I expected. I haven't been through the entire game, and neither will I, especially at this point.
To add to this; my computer worked harder than the tractor in the field to run this. It definitely requires a lot more optimization.

"I recommend this if you're deep in to Melvor and need new content. I do not recommend this if you're a newer player who has yet to break through in to the god dungeons and beyond.

Atlas of Discovery sits in a weird space. It provides some alternate avenues of advancement and much needed easier bank space tokens for hardcore characters. Problem is that it's expensive (resource wise), time consuming, and doesn't really flow as much with the rest of the game. The barrier aspect is interesting but feels like it should have been a new combat style for the 3 combat archetypes instead of what it is. Coming in to Atlas at a high level isn't dangerous so much as it is annoying because of how strong mob reflect is so you either need to nerf your own damage a bit, stack DR, or pursue reduced damage weapons that are available.

My biggest issue with this is that I feel that archaeology needs some sort of passive aspect to it, similar to township. It would be nice if you could integrate township and archaeology together to have an archaeologists guild, or hire archaeologists to slowly chip away at it for you while you're not actively working on the skill.

Again, if you want more Melvor content and to continue to support Malcs then absolutely. If you're a new player, wait until you know if you want this.",1,0

"Improves on a lot over thief simulator, but still has many of the very hard-to-ignore control problems the first game had.
- You frequently struggle to walk over small ridges in the terrain. If a platform is 0.5 inches higher than you, you have to jump to get on it.
- You have to look DIRECTLY at something to interact with it. Want to get in you car? Try looking at the car. Not working? Try looking at the driver's side door. STILL not working? Try looking specifically at the handle. I don't know what reason they forced this precision, but it doesn't add to the enjoyment or immersion.
- Movement is jerky to start when you press the buttons and slowly trundles to a stop when you let go. Other games manage to make you feel like you have momentum without it being so uncomfortable.

I'm glad to see they've improved a lot over the first game. A lot of interactions are a lot cleaner. You can see how full an item will make your backpack. Looking at an NPC will show you their schedule. All of the fine details have been polished somewhat.
The graphics are a lot better too, but that was never what made the original game feel good.

They've managed to keep that addictive core of sneaking around people's houses and sticky-fingering lots of little valuables, and I'm glad they haven't lost the core of their enjoyment. But if they can't fix basic movement issues from the first game, I'm not going to spend money to buy the same problems a 2nd time.

I appreciate that they made a demo available, however. Tempted to buy this when it comes out just to encourage that practice. It takes balls to put out what you have for free before you have people's money in your grip.",1,0

The visuals are not bad, but the frame rate suffers A LOT. The audio could use some work. The controls are terrible: sometimes you jump and the guy just jumps in place despite pressing forward. It is difficult to judge the direction of a jump. The character glitches through terrain and doesn't always grab on to anything. Having looked at the reviews for Only Up, this seems like it has the same issues as that minus all the NFT promotion. In the absence of knowledge, I have gone with a thumbs up (because there is no thumbs sideways.) If you like this type of game, this is more of that type of game.

"Revenge of Noxi is a 2D side-scrolling action game in the vein of Ninja Gaiden or Shinobi but with a couple modern tricks up its sleeve. The game appears to be the second endeavor by developer Megamini009, following up a previous 2D game from a few years ago.

I'm all for a throwback to Shinobi, and I can very much feel what the developer was going for here. I really like the feeling of some of the protagonist's moveset: the jumpkick and slide moves in particular feel great, especially when you're executing a series of jumpkicks, bouncing back and forth between targets - it almost feels reminiscent of Hollow Knight's pogo bounce.

Enemies generally have fairly predictable movesets and attack patterns, and overall I did find them reasonably challenging to dispatch without being frustratingly difficult.

There are a number of areas I'd like to see improved, if the game receives ongoing updates:

1. It's a bit difficult to negotiate the fact that the player doesn't have total control of their moves/attacks at all times. Sometimes, it appears that a sword slash is executed, while at other times, shuriken are thrown. Sometimes, jumpkicks are executed, while at other times, shuriken are thrown. I think I see what the developer was going for - contextual attacks based on your target seems like an interesting idea. However, I really think it leads to a lack of player agency, and it generally just made me feel confused or frustrated. All I want is to jumpkick the flamethrower dudes! Let me jumpkick them!

2. The artwork across the game suffers from an issue I often see with small indie games: it was clearly created using a variety of different canvas sizes, resulting in individual pixels that are different sizes when comparing sprites and objects to one another. I would recommend aligning this. Use one sprite as your baseline - it will determine the pixel size for everything else.

3. There are a variety of collision issues across the game - they're particularly evident in the sewer level, both when sliding down slopes, as well as when swimming in general. These should be tightened up. Similarly, there are issues with hitboxes - the player's hitbox is frustratingly large, for example.

4. I don't know why so many indie games nowadays use mouse control when there's no need for it. I'd just default to keyboard controls for attacking. I know these can be remapped, but making your player work straight out of the gate isn't a great feeling.

5. There are some issues with the player character's state being reset or nulled, particularly when taking damage. For instance, if I'm sprinting and then get hit, not only do I stop sprinting, I also can't start sprinting again unless I release and press Shift again. This feels bad. Sprinting in particular should resume after damage is taken, even without the player needing to release and press the button again.

6. Level design gets a bit convoluted, particularly in the later levels. It's unclear to me if there are optional branching paths based on where the player exits the level. For instance, in the sewer level, there are a lot of vertical paths, but not a lot of guidance for the player as to why they might travel vertically. What's their motivation?

If the controls, level design, and artwork could be tightened up, I think this would be a really charming little action game. Parts of it feel nice and imbue a pleasant nostalgia to Shinobi and similar games. However, as it stands, I think the issues listed above make the game a bit frustrating to play, and the control issues in particular had me scratching my head more than a few times.

If you release an update addressing these issues, please leave a comment on this review and I'll be happy to take another look!

"I feel somewhat bad giving this a thumb down, so to clarify, I very much support this game existing.  The world has needed a spiritual successor to Command & Conquer, looking to continue its legacy when EA squats on the license itself and makes a worthy sequel not an option.  BECAUSE we need this, I am willing to forgive how unoriginal the story is.  Sure, this game is also set in an alternate universe version of the 1990s, the two factions are obvious expies of GDI and NOD and the titular Tempest functions just about identically to Tiberium and looks almost exactly like it, only red, but that's fine.  No, that's BETTER than fine; it's a near necessity to be this on-the-nose to rub in how much EA has failed the C&C fandom and how much we want this.  This is aimed directly at the C&C fans, so it's a good thing to make sure they all know it.

So what's the problem?  Well, based on this demo so far, it's that the GAMEPLAY also doesn't have any appreciable evolution or twists from the actual C&C series the last (good) time we saw it.  That might not seem fair to hold against only the first mission, but I still feel like more could be done.  Certainly, Priority One for this sort of game is that you prove you can get the basics down, and the demo definitely proves they can, but even a demo should do a bit more than this.  We don't just want a game that feels like a remake of Command & Conquer 3; we want a game that feels like a sequel to it except better than the sequel EA gave us.  Restarting the story from scratch is, of course, inevitable, but otherwise there should be SOME sense of something new piled atop of what C&C3 was.  That is all the more true because, while this might have been the only C&C spiritual successor in the works at one time, now there are several.  All of them, therefor, must do more to stand out.

This first mission was about as basic as C&C gameplay can get.  You have a few types of units units that have distinct abilities but none of them are anything out of the ordinary, and the way it was set up hardly requires you to consider individual units' strengths and weaknesses.  Strategy here doesn't extend beyond proceeding with care, shooting explosive barrels to cheese your enemies and otherwise overwhelming them with superior numbers.  Maybe being the first mission necessitates it being this easy but I think there should have been at least one unit with a somewhat unconventional appearance and unique abilities available for the player to control and playing a pivotal role.

All that being said, does it make me less optimistic for the final game?  No, not exactly.  Just because developers can't make a good ""vertical slice"" doesn't mean they can't make a good game.  I fully expect this to get more interesting as it gets more challenging.  But I can't speak for how well this will go over with people who aren't already familiar with C&C and thus don't have anything besides this demo to breed anticipation.  Maybe they're unfamiliarity will make this look new and exciting but maybe it'll mean they don't get why this is a big deal.",1,0

"I have only played one round so far, but i want to get out first impression and a WARNING ! foremost.

If you have played ""20 Minutes Till Dawn"" (20MTD) you will kinda know this game.
It feels like a Copy-Cat.

Many, if not most, (!) upgrades are the same as in 20MTD, often straight up 1:1 copy.
You get small bosses and normal bosses. Those get you upgrade crates. Those from real bosses will net you good upgrades which often do reduce your max health (same as in 20MTD)
2. char will have more starting HP (same as in 20MTD)
Bosses will create an arena, those outer lines will also look very similar to the ones found in 20MTD.
Even the reload animation is the same.

Translation (in my testing case english) is just a ""google translation"". I guess most other than the native language will be.

Is it just a reskin of 20MTD ? 
No.
It does bring some new things to the table you'll find in other survivors games.
Like Magnet which attracts all loot/exp. Some Power-Ups in the field.
Gold Ressource for permanent upgrades/new characters. 
Has more colorful graphics than 20MTD.

So if you haven't played 20MTD it might be worth buying. 
Otherwise i'd wait.

Wouldn't have thought that i'd buy like a 80-90% rip-off from 20MTD.

"I'm torn on this expansion. I like what they've done with leaders for the most part, but the leadership cap really hinders exploration early game. Going from having a scientist specialized in a specific field in it's associated research slot to a single scientist with a specialization for a specific field over lapping all research slots is a step backward in my opinion. imo, they should have left the 3 scientist slots and the head empire researcher granting bonuses to the scientists researching already. 

Other than that, the leaders updates are pretty awesome!",0,1

"Let me start by stating the obvious; this game is in early access. Obviously a lot about the game is unfinished, but I think there are some solid ideas and concepts that interested me enough to buy the game in the first place. I'll give my feelings first and then I'll leave an itemized list at the end with my pros/cons and suggestions.

The game (single player campaign mode was the only mode I played) as of posting this review seems like it could go several directions. If I had to give a comparison to similar games I've played, it would be similar to Natural Selection 2 with more random elements. I think the flying of ships is fun, could potentially use some more work and maybe even a mode where you test pilot ships just to see how they handle.

However, the following flaws of the game are glaringly obvious to me: Lack of an adequate Heads up Display (HUD), or even an around the screen User Interface (UI) to help me know what was going on, hampered my ability to respond to enemy threats. The CPU allies were competent in their fighting, but they often would just swarm off towards the nearest target, leaving my refineries out undefended. The repair ships (Camels) would cluster behind the mothership when they weren't healing it, but I noticed they would not repair the smaller ships in my fleet such as the fighters or bombers, which really hurt my economy. The refineries were frustrating as well, as they would all cluster together flying off towards the nearest resource. I feel the refineries need to spread themselves out a bit more. I realize that the refineries spreading out could cause some issues with defending them, but that leads me to my next point; this game NEEDS to have some commands you can issue to your squadrons. As others have pointed out in their reviews, I would watch the side of my screen helpless as my entire strike force would get destroyed by one enemy capital ship that had anti-fighter weapons. Another issue I had was that I felt that my actual efforts gathering resources were worthless in the game, as there would be random ships that would spawn on my side. While I'm not against help now and again, getting random top-tier capital ships on level 3 when all I could afford was Slingshots just made me feel like the game was playing completely independent of my actions. I did also take control of one of these capital ships, and was underwhelmed with its lack of accuracy and firepower (I can't remember which ship, but it had cannons with a large spread and a 7500 hit point pool). I feel like each ship needs better aiming reticles to visualize weapon spread. The UI could do with some effect to indicate that a hit was landed on, or missed, an enemy.

I'm sure there are other issues that have been pointed out, but these are the ones that stuck out to me. Overall, I had fun for the hour or so that I played it. I enjoyed the maps, the alien enemies were fun to fight as well as the enemy ships. I like the idea, and being able to play this with friends excites me, but the game is just not in a place where I can recommend buying it right now. I will reiterate that this is an early access game, but the developer appears to be receptive to feedback. I'll of course alter my review as the game changes because this title interests me and I'd like to see where it goes.

Pros:
-Fast paced space ship game.
-Can play as any ship you can build (sans the refinery and mothership).
-Has a multiplayer mode along with campaign mode that can be played by several people.

Cons:
-Still in early development, lots of concepts are unfinished.
-AI allies clump up whenever attacking or resource gathering, making them very susceptible to area of effect attacks.
-Campaign mode randomly warps in allied ships for you, making your own war efforts feel miniscule.
-Resource gathering is slow because refineries cluster together towards resources instead of spreading out to better facilitate logistics (i.e. shortening the distance between mining location and resource depositing).
-Lack of HUD makes player response to threats slow and almost ineffectual; allied AI either have the threat handled or get completely blown up before you're even able to get to a spot to support them.

Recommendations:
-Add a HUD with a tactical map to help locate threats and resources.
-Improve Camel AI to repair allied fighters that are in a resting/defending range around the allied mothership.
-Improve refinery AI to spread out to improve logistics/economy.
-Add squadron commands along with the ability to assign ships to wings such as a strike force, mothership defense, or refinery defense. This could be done by making the mothership into a pilotable ship that you can't control its own movement, but can direct your allied forces from like a command deck. 
     >There also needs to be attack and retreat commands.
-Adjust how allied ships randomly spawn-in during campaign mode. While random elements are fun, I feel that this game is advertised towards the kind of player who plays games where their efforts and strategies make a clear difference.

Ideas:
-Give Campaign mode either some meta-progression or a way to improve things in between levels.
     >Possibly utilize in-game resources to improve weapons, hitpoints, economy, etc.
-Add options to reduce random allied ship spawning. Some people may enjoy that aspect of the game, so adding some customization could be appealing.
-More multiplayer options? While I did only play campaign, it appeared there was just one other mode available.
     >Capture the Flag
     >Resource Race
     >Dueling Mothership defense (I'd do something like campaign with two opposing motherships flying opposing parallel or just parallel paths)

Thank you for reading this review, and if the developer is reading this, I hope this review isn't taken as anything but my own objective criticism.",1,0

"I tried this game out on mobile, and on seeing that it's on Steam, I chose to immediately switch over to PC because I prefer PC controls. However, it was disappointing to see that the PC keybinds have yet to be implemented. With the current controls on PC, the game is workable. But the gameplay experience would definitely be better once keybinds are added to make it easier to utilize the many functions of the game. One important aspect that needs to be said is that there should be an interaction key to get drops, and it shouldn't coincide with the combat key. When I was in combat, it was a bit of a nuisance when the game would make me click on a corpse to get their drops over trying to attack the hostile mobs around me. 

Another thing that needs to be worked on are the storage systems. First, there is the resource storage. For this system, I don't really understand why the player can only store 10 per resource over the 20 that they can hold. The point of a storage system is to free up space within the player's inventory. However, with the storage system only holding 10 per resource over the 20 that the player can hold, it fails to achieve this goal because the item will still be within the player's inventory if they're carrying over 10 of the resource. Thus, the player will still end up needing to drop a lot of the resources that they have, which makes the storage system a bit pointless. 

Then, there is the equipment storage. For this system, it has far too little space for how the equipment upgrading system works. To upgrade equipment, the player needs to gain copies of each equipment that they have, while also making sure that they're of the same rarity. Currently, to viably do this, the player is going to have to only focus on one item that they want to upgrade each time. Thus, the player will have to drop a lot of the other equipment that they may want to upgrade later because they have a lack of storage space to hold them. Furthermore, this also means that the player also can't do merchant runs when trying to get equipment because it's going to take up too much inventory space trying to do both at the same time. Therefore, I would like to suggest that the equipment storage should, at least, have far more slots than the 4 that it currently has. Additionally, I think having two separate inventories, one for resources and the other for equipment, is also something that the developers should think about doing. 

Overall, while there are certainly some things that should be worked on a bit more to better the gameplay experience for the player, this game is still enjoyable enough, and it is something I'll play more of to see how it develops.",0,1

Overall the  MC is just a bit mean but it is not his fault because of his mentality- But still he really could be a lot nicer and still be passive agressive",0,1

"It's alright. I'd say I approximately got what I paid for. There are a few things to think about, but most of the game is just repeating what you already know. 

I feel the game could be made a bit better by giving resources more freely and having the player build 2-3 tiles per turn on average instead of nearly just one every turn as the cycling through crops part is not that exciting. The meat of the game is learning to design intelligent layouts, so the main loop should focus on having the player do that a little more.

I also think the secret tiles unlock progression doesn't fit well into the game as it currently is. 

Could be enjoyable for some, but it didn't really grip me much.",0,1

"[h2] Brief Personal History with Dragon Quest Dai [/h2]
I am someone who grew-up with the original [b] 1991 Dragon Quest Dai anime, aka ""Dai no Daibouken"" [/b] (practically MY CHILDHOOD) and it was also my all time favorite anime back in the 90s. The only regret I have about the original anime is that it wasn't finished and had stopped at episode 46 (REALLY wish they continued it to the end back then). And yes, I'm aware of the 2020 anime remake (I remember crying when I saw that announcement), but sadly, in terms of ""comparable episodes"" (i.e. The original anime's 46 episodes vs the remake anime's 25 episodes), the remake anime PALES IN COMPARISON to the original anime and cannot compete whatsoever in terms of action sequences (particularly against main villains) and ESPECIALLY in the music department.

[h2] How I Feel About the Video Game Adaptation [/h2]
While it was a ""dream come true"" for me when a video game of my favorite 90s anime was announced, unfortunately, ""Infinity Strash: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai"" turned out to be [b] a major disappointment [/b] overall. Below are the main cons and pros that I can say about this game, having completed the main game (and the side dungeon along the way):

[h3] Cons: [/h3]
1) [b] Main complain - Story Presentation: [/b] The story of this game (and majority of its ""gameplay"") is just a [b] visual novel [/b] that is told through multiple narrated ""still-images"" that have been ripped off straight from the 2020 anime remake and that's basically how most main points of the story are told for the entirety of the game. Needless to say, having already watched the whole 2020 anime remake before playing this game, it was a ""grueling experience"" to sit through all those cutscenes and whether I skipped them or not, the fact is that majority of this game is just these anime-ripped cutscenes that neither serve anime fans (because of how poorly the story is told through them) nor the video game fans who just want to play the game rather than sitting around, doing nothing while being bombarded with all those anime cutscenes for most of the game.

2) [b] Explorable Areas: [/b] It is even sadder that, when you FINALLY get to the ""gameplay"" part, most of playable locations are either [b] short-length levels [/b] with boring/bland backgrounds and barely anything to do besides killing a few monsters before reaching the end of the level OR [b] boss arenas [/b] where you are immediately get thrown into a boss battle, which simply RUINS the ""build-up"" to the boss battle that you would normal get from other games where you actually ADVENTURE through a long level, leading into the boss room/area.

3) [b] Combat: [/b] As for the combat itself, it's very basic and to me is RUINED by the inclusion of annoying [b] cooldowns [/b] for skills (which are especially frustrating when enemies interrupt you and then you have to WAIT AGAIN until the cooldown is over to be able to attack again), while the dodge/guard feel very ""unresponsive/sluggish"" that led me to take A LOT OF DAMAGE for absolutely no reason even when I pressed the buttons at the correct time. I really feel like a ""Kingdom Hearts-style"" gameplay with a side menu and ""HP/MP bar"" would have been the right combat system for this game as an ""action RPG"".

4) [b] Game Music: [/b] The overall music for the most part is simply TERRIBLE and is mainly taken from 2020 anime remake (which, as I said at the beginning, PALES in comparison to the original 1991 anime's soundtrack). The only exception is maybe the ""World Map Music"" which actually sounds ""decent/catchy"" so I didn't mind that one in particular, but the rest of the music would have been better off being [b] new original music [/b] that should have been made specifically for the video game adaptation IMO.

5) [b] Temple of Recollection side dungeon: [/b] I saw other reviewers claim that this was the ""highlight"" of this game, but to me, it had its own set of issues that made it another ""tedious"" aspect of this game such as being:
- [b] Repetitive [/b] for both regular monsters and main bosses.
- [b] Extremely long to get to the end with NO ""Quick Saves"" [/b] to be able to resume at a later point.
- [b] Unforgiving in that there are NO REVIVES [/b] during the entirety of the run, so if a character dies, you either have to continue at a MAJOR DISADVANTAGE (i.e. by making all subsequent battles longer/more tedious) OR quit the dungeon run at the earliest point possible and start over again with a full party (oh, and if your entire party dies or you quit mid-way through the floor, you LOSE all the rewards you gained to that point).
- [b] Many frustrating enemies, [/b] ESPECIALLY those stupid ""exploding rocks"" that self-destruct and OHKO one of your characters, forcing you more than likely to quit and start over because of the disadvantage that you have to deal with afterwards. This is even extra frustrating when those self-destructing rocks kill one of the ""AI-controlled"" party members (so even when it is not your fault, the game STILL punishes you for things that are out of your hands).

[h3] Pros: [/h3]
1) Character 3D Models look actually nice in-game.
2) Elemental aspects like ""Fire, Water, Lightning, etc..."" look gorgeous.
3) As such, combining points 1+2, ""Ultimate Attacks"" for both good and evil characters look badass.
4) Also, the few [b] IN-GAME rendered cutscenes [/b] (using the game's engine) that generally play after defeating major bosses look AMAZING and really made me wish that THIS was how the overall story was told (along with properly constructed ""adventuring levels"") for a better story experience.

[h2] Conclusion: [/h2]

Overall, ""Infinity Strash: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai"" video game didn't get the treatment (and budget) it deserved. The terrible presentation of its story as well as the primitive/shallow gameplay just didn't feel engaging or worth the $60 price tag (probably worth $15 AT MOST). Even as a long-time fan of the original 1991 Dragon Quest Dai anime, I suggest that you [b] skip this game entirely [/b] and maybe consider watching the existing anime adaptations if you are interested in the story of ""Dai"" himself and that's that.

[b] Final Rating: 4/10. [/b]",1,0

"From what I can tell this game functions fairly well in Desktop mode. In VR mode not so much. I enjoy what's there but it needs a lot of work. For the most part it feels like it's been developed mostly for the Vive/Oculus as you'll quickly find out when playing with an Index. Controls needed remapping to get out to the first area to really get going. You are then met with the issue of your HUD being so tiny that you cant see your own health. My biggest gripe with the game is mostly how the weapons get positioned relative to your person. For example when I picked up the shotgun the position of my hand isn't on the trigger of the gun but rather positioned off to the right side of the under barrel of the weapon. It seems nitpicky but it feels wrong you're handling it real time. I've got no problem with auto reloads either but in a VR game if you deprive me of the satisfaction of reloading the shotgun after I blast enemies with it then it just kinda feels hollow. 

I give the Dev points for doing this. Even more so for including it with the desktop version FOR FREE. More developers of these kinds of classic style 3D shooters should look into porting their game into VR and it can work like it did with Serious Sam and Amid Evil. I assume the experience is different on an Oculus Headset or a Vive but for the Index this game just comes with a lot jank. It's a ""Not Recommended"" based solely on Index functionality. I'm sure this game could be one of the VR greats with some more polish and QOL updates. But as it is, it's more bothersome to play (on an index) than on desktop mode. Dont discard the game fully if the jank in VR is offputting, the desktop version does still give you a decent game regardless.",1,0

"Not as ""weird"" all in all but a pretty solid game. Language localization could use some work, there are some things, like art assets, that have not been modified in the slightest. Difficulty scaling is a bit odd.. if you dodge at all the correct times you could theoretically beat every boss from the very beginning of the game (though it would take a long time). But, with an average dodge ratio, let's say two dodges for every one hit that you take, the amount of damage that you take makes it seem like there should be at least one or two more bosses in-between every boss that you face. Either that or you are expected to farm the bosses in order to get every piece of their armor before going on to the next area.

Due to it being made with Unity, the game will occasionally lag when there are too many visual effects on the screen at the same time.

There is very limited direction/information on where to go and what to do and due to the game's name it is very difficult to search for if you get stuck. The summon defeated bosses aspect of the game is never really explained (that I remember) and one must figure it out on their own. Overall, I wouldn't spend more than $2-$5 for it as it currently is.

"It is trying to die faster than ""Like a Dragon: Ishin!"". 

The story is pretty good, it serves as a good insight on what happened before the events of ""Yakuza: Like a Dragon"", it also spoils the events of that game so if you planned on playing it after ""Yakuza 6: The Song of Life"", you'll have to keep that mind. 
The characters are far from unique, as they just make the same characters every game (1 prettyboy killer, 1 brute, 1 that helps the main character, and of course the mastermind/s), but the villains were still well written compared to some previous games, because you can actually understand their goals and maybe even agree with them.
Despite only 5 chapters, the length of the game is pretty decent, there are plenty of filler missions to stretch it out but I didn't complain, as I wanted to experience it as much as possible.

Side content is also solid (not the hostess dating), the new Coliseum is awesome (to some degree), and you can even dress up Kiryu for the first time, as well as play as more than 30 characters in the Coliseum. Now, those characters' movesets are obviously extremely limited, but it is a step in the right direction and I am looking forward to seeing more of that in their future beat 'em ups.

As a hardcore Yakuza fan, it hurts me to write a negative review but making a positive one would be overlooking all the major flaws the combat system has. 

1. The combat's main combo mechanic is air juggling, but there are only 7 launchers? If we compare it to Lost Judgment (which is what this game wanted to copy but did a horrible job of), that game has so many launchers people can't even count them all.
Now, those 7 would mean something, had there been JUST 1 that works consistently, and the 1 that had potential to work consistently (wire pull), does NOT work on any stronger enemy such as bosses and mini bosses, as Kiryu is apparently not strong enough to pull a 140lb femboy with painted nails. 
Five out of seven launchers require you to do an extremely slow combo beforehand, during which you'll get hit a billion times and then the enemy will most likely dodge or block the launching move. Now you're down to only 1 launcher to rely on for stronger enemies (Agent EX Light X2). Sure, there are ways to relaunch enemies with this one to make the combat a bit more fluid. But is 1 somewhat consistent launcher what you want to see in a combat system that focuses on air juggling?
Cause you sure as hell can't do ground combos to mini-bosses or bosses without getting countered. 
The fun dies faster than an unvaccinated baby.

2. So you finally launched an enemy? Great job, now what? Did you expect to juggle the enemy for at least 10 seconds? Poor you. The developers have coded a specific 6 second limit after you land your first hit, after which the enemy is simply going to tank your hits and drop to the floor. Why? They removed Lost Judgment's damage reduction so they thought, juggling for too long would be too OP, there shall not be a juggle longer than 6 seconds. You expected a moveset with a decently fast combo speed to land as many hits as possible in that short time period? Too bad, cause you're not getting it. The original (Yakuza) style's combo speed is slower than Saejima's in Yakuza 4, it is so slow it will remind you of Yakuza 0's Mr. Shakedown.
What's even sadder is that the developers coded a combo speed boost on the Yakuza style, and it activates when THE ENEMY IS LYING ON THE GROUND. Thanks Sega. I simply couldn't wait to execute some amazing combos on a helpless enemy collecting dust on the floor. 
The ""Agent"" style's combo speed is not great either, it's similar to the Yakuza 6 non-upgraded combo speed, but its rush combo has probably twice the amount of hits so it's unnoticeable. 

3. Okay, the Yakuza style is bad. The Agent style can't be THAT bad right? 
Well, you know how weak your punches are in your dreams? No matter how hard you swing, you can't hurt anyone? That's essentially Agent style.
Its combos work well only on weaker enemies, because if you try to bluntly attack any stronger enemy with it, you'll be shut down very quickly. The gadgets are cool (wire and cigarette especially), and extremely overpowered when upgraded fully, but just like the combos, you only feel their usefulness when you are fighting weaker enemies. 
With the wire you can pull a dozen enemies and throw them as you wish, and the cigarette can blow up a whole group with ease. 
On stronger enemies, the wire doesn't work, the drones are just poking them uselessly, unless you fully upgrade them, then they still poke them but deal more damage, the serpent has 1 use and not what the developers intended, and the cigarette is just.. the cigarette.
It also has no skillful counter attacks, only 1 braindead dodge counter that you can spam as long as you're in EX-heat, if just 1 of them served as a launcher I probably wouldn't even be writing this review. Actually, I still would.

4. Certain moves that were launchers in Judgment and Lost Judgment are no longer launchers for absolutely no reason (for example Yakuza style reverse Square X2, Triangle X1), and certain moves that were very useful in Yakuza 6/Yakuza Kiwami 2 were also removed for, again, absolutely no reason.
You cannot grab enemies from behind anymore, which automatically removed about 4-5 very useful heat actions. 
The Yakuza style grab & throw is now a reuse from Yakuza 0's Brawler style, instead of bringing back the spin which was extremely useful in group fights OR God forbid, making a new throw. 
Finishing holds which were the primary crowd control tool, now require you to be in extreme heat for, yet again, absolutely no reason. 
Timing for the infamous ""Komaki Tiger Drop"" has also been shortened, as if Kiryu hasn't been using it for over 15 years now, making it an inconsistent tool to get rid of enemies with a lot of health for, you guessed it, no reason whatsoever.
Remember the parry from Yakuza 6/Kiwami 2? Removed. 
Remember how you would grab enemies in the middle of their attack to shut them down? Removed, you immediately get punished. 
Remember the Lost Judgment ""floating state""? That random mechanic when the enemy doesn't fall to the ground anymore as long as you keep hitting? It still exists in Gaiden, but you have a higher chance of convincing a flat earther he's wrong, than getting an enemy in the ""floating state"", which would be the only mechanic that could save Gaiden's combat from getting old extremely fast. 
I definitely forgot a few. 

5. The battle design.. Oh boy. Nearly every fight after the first chapter has a couple of enemies with guns, that will shoot you through their allies, so before you do anything, you have to go around the map and take out the gun-wielding enemies one by one. Does that sound fun?
On top of that, almost every long battle has you facing multiple bosses/mini-bosses at the same time, which the game absolutely DOES NOT prepare you for. Don't believe me? Just take a look at any YouTube video recording that type of situation. What you will see is heat action spamming to get rid of 1 miniboss first so they can at least have fun with the other (and even that's rare, most people just cheese both). Does that scream quality combat system? You know how in ""Sifu"" you can handle multiple stronger enemies at the same time in style if you're skillful enough, by utilizing punching, dodging and parrying? Yakuza developers have not heard of that.
I should also mention that the enemy AI, which was perfect in ""Lost Judgment"", was also changed and now multiple enemies attack at the same time, which wouldn't be an issue, like it's not an issue in ""Sifu"", if you could manage multiple enemies stylishly, instead of spamming the wire or cigarette bombs, or if you want to get hit, you can always just mash your controller and brute-force your way through. 
My 9 year old brother will definitely enjoy that!

There is an odd scroll random unlock system reminiscent of a mobile game that seems irrelevant for the most part. You can by all the options and I found the scrolls really just gave me currency.

"The story text needs to be completely reviewed and corrected to make proper sense. Spell checking helps too. The game itself was WAY too short and should be more intuitive to the viewer. The animation sequences looked silly and need to be refined better. The characters looked blockey, with unrealistic body parts (there is no need for the MC's penis to be grotesquely enlarged and neither do the breasts of the female characters for that matter) and unrefined. The motion of the characters should be more fluid and natural. Some of it looked really bad. Almost like it was moving 1-2 FPS. More choices regarding branches or actions would definitely help this to be a better visual novel. Look at other platforms like College Kings I/II, Grandma's House or College Bound and see their style and flow. Overall, I'd give this a D- for overall style, creativity, look and flow. I'm sure that this is probably a first attempt, but attention to detail makes things better. Rewrite your storyboard and outline and spell check the dialogue to smooth it out. Keep trying guys.",1,0

"[h1]Experienced on the Meta Quest 2[/h1]

You can view my gameplay & early impressions here: https://youtu.be/-GKftowmLRE

[u]This is a neutral recommendation.[/u] I am not recommending this game in its current state. However, if the idea of this game interests you, then you may consider supporting the development (knowing the risk in general of doing this). 

Is this a good game currently? No. Is this a good concept? Yes. Is there enough here for the budget price? That's a very tough call. I say maybe if you like the idea of this game then you may get your money's worth. But it is difficult for me to recommend this game knowing the issues.

The biggest issue is the LOD. It's really bad on the Cook Mountain, Australia map. Lots of pop-in and the draw distance is very low without any way of changing it from within the game. It looks very bad. Keep in mind, this game currently only has two maps. This game should be labeled as Early Access. It has 4 maps listed as coming soon. That would be 2/3 of the game still not available.

The other big issue, besides LOD and limited content, is that you have to register an e-mail address with a 3rd party site. Why? Why do some VR developers insist on doing this? You are literally killing off sales of your game. Nobody wants to register with a 3rd party site to play a game they are paying for. Nobody.

Game is running on the Unity Engine. On my RTX 3080, on high graphical settings, I was getting a steady 90 fps. However, I didn't really notice much of a difference between high or low graphical settings. You do have full locomotion, along with snap turning. The only settings available are graphical (high, medium, or low) and music, plus volume. The controls are switched from the normal left joystick controlling movement, to the right stick controlling movement. Why? I have no idea but apparently this developer is left-handed and has never played a game before with a controller.

[b]Rate 5/10. Only buy to support development, knowing risks involved that it is possible game doesn't get updated in the future.[/b]

"Pros: 
- Marvel Snap vibes. 
- Cool aethesitc, nice cards. 
- Synergies seem standard but work decently together.
- It's $1 

Cons: 
- Lack of tutorial. (You'll literally have to guess how to play this game) 
- Game bricking bugs (One happened first play where End Turn wouldn't work, second happened after I beat all the enemies of the first level) 
- Must click to open reward after a fight win. 
- No idea how you earn money... (I clicked on tiles and buildings  and it only prompted to Buy a Safehouse, but without money)
- UI in game doesn't match the Video Preview, there's no difficultly bar, no attack button, or Go To Rest. 
- Card Abilities only show on play. So you can't ever view effects or at least I didn't find on after hovering, clicking, etc.) 
- There's a hidden character limit on sections during battle. Multiple drops when I had energy points didn't work. 
- Point counter is on the top away from the player towards the top of the screen,  I couldn't tell at first  points I was scoring and though it was the enemies. 


Overall, I think there's something here but when you have no tutorial, massive breaking bugs, and missing UI/QOL/Indicators I'd say it's near impossible to actually play the game. 

Just speculation but maybe the pushed the wrong build version because this is busted.

"I have very mixed feelings leaving this review. On the one hand, I love Muv-Luv and I am ecstatic to even see ""The Imperial Capital Burns"" on Steam - so many thought it'd never come. On the other hand, I feel like every port just gets worse. I just spent 45 min just trying to get full screen to work. Go to full screen and you'll see the words get cut off - fixed to screen option on or off, it doesn't matter. Re-launching the game with full screen results in a black picture with music. It's ridiculous and so obvious, any QA should have picked this up. I eventually got Fullscreen working using the Borderless Gaming app. 

I guess I must be a sucker for Muv-Luv though, because for all that I hate how aNCHOR handles these releases, I'll keep throwing my money at them just hoping they'll give us all of Muv-Luv. 

But seriously aNCHOR, for the sake of old fans and new, could you please start giving a crap?",0,1

"It is always important to give a description of physical fitness/demand when reviewing a VR game. I am a very overweight 30-something man, but otherwise have no serious illnesses. This game is sufficiently physically demanding that I cannot do much else for some time if I play this. This game is very physically intense. I absolutely do not recommend this for anyone who is not prepared for a serious workout.

This game has options to play in a chair. I recommend strongly against that. You should be standing while playing this.

As the description says, Timberman VR is a game that is very easy to learn, but extremely difficult to master. You play as the titular Timberman on his quest to take vengeance against a nearby forest. You line your axe up and chop in the direction of the arrow. If you cut in the wrong direction, the tree curses you to death. Sometimes you have to cut branches - either with your axe or the machete in your off-hand - before you can cut the tree. Sometimes there are squirrels and beehives on these branches. Hitting bees hurts you, hitting squirrels gives you a shield against mistakes - I assume that this is because Timberman turns the squirrel into an anti-tree salve or something. Parts of the tree can be replaced with bombs or cuckoo clocks - which you have to smack away with the blunt of your axe before they destroy you.

There's a campaign mode, where all of the elements are toned down. The campaign mode might lead one to believe that the game is casual. However, the bulk of the game is the arcade mode - which is deeply unforgiving on the mode where you can actually upload a score. Due to the presence of the tree, you are constantly drained by the tree curse, and the only way to keep the tree's curse away is to cut the tree repeatedly. You do this until your inevitable death. The drain speeds up as the game progresses in time, making it very difficult to last even 5 minutes. Keeping yourself alive during this time is a very sweaty affair.

The game feels mechanically buggy. The tolerances for cutting down the tree are somewhat tight - you really do need to hit the tree at a good angle in order for your hit to count. The weapon tracking feels sluggish in the arcade mode - if you hit at a slightly bad angle, then your axe doesn't really ""snap"" back to your hand once it's in a good position. About 1 in 200 chops, I observe that my axe either glances off the front of the tree or it fails to notice I've hit the tree. I suspect that the dev would say that my precision is a little bad, but I have not had a problem like this in other games. It's easily the most frustrating part of the game. (Update: I've learned this is due to me hitting the log before the game considers the log destructible.)

As a game, I would give this a miss. There's a lack of polish that makes the game feel unrewarding, which isn't good. Moreover, the combination of the game billing itself as a ""casual"" game and the rather high difficulty of the arcade mode is questionable. This makes it a little reminiscent of Winnie the Pooh's Home Run Derby, in the sense that it looks like it is supposed to be a casual game but the bulk of the game is...not.

As a workout, this is significantly more valuable - a 1 hour play session where you play the arcade mode is enough to wear anybody reasonable out. The speed you need to go at to keep chopping away for more than 2 minutes is pretty intense, and maintaining focus during this is not particularly easy. This game is actually quite amazing for someone looking for an intense workout, and for such people I would suggest this game without much hesitation.

I feel as if the devs wanted to build a normal, casual game and accidentally made something that's one of the more physically intense workout games on Steam. This makes it hard to recommend to someone who has found the game and is looking for something light. If you're reading this, then that's probably you - which is why this review is marked negative. However, there is certainly an unintended audience which this game likely appeals to - if you are part of this audience, then you should certainly ignore the above review and enjoy becoming a very sweaty timberman.",1,0

[h1]First Impressions[/h1] 
Maybe it's partly due to how technology is becoming more advanced and involved with my daily life, but there's something appealing to the idea of hacking games. The internet is vast, packed with immense amounts of knowledge, and could be incredibly valuable to the right people. I don't relish the tedium of building code, or risking everything by breaking the law. However, a game like DROP – System Breach (SB) can provide a little rush if it's fun, so I thought I'd check it out. 


[h1]Gameplay[/h1] 
With movies showing hacking as being rapid-paced typing, how does SB go about the process? It places a similar emphasis on speed, as you'll make your way through various data ports, hubs, and obstacles connected by a network. Although each item connects to the next by a cardinal direction, the branches can split off and expand more than you might expect. In essence, your goal is to access and traverse through each network, finding your objectives and completing them before time runs out. 

At times that means finding a specific user account, downloading or deleting a couple of files, turning off key cameras, or downloading all the data available to sell off. With enough funds you can buy supporting programs that will automate processes for you, and although they'll help, you'll still need to do most of the work yourself. They make for excellent multitaskers, as they can explore a route you've not even looked at.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3052249896
[h1]Controls[/h1] 
The developers recommend playing SB with a controller, which surprised me because the store page says it only has partial controller support. Once I better understood all of the features that the different hubs and programs have, it became second nature to travel through networks and deal with various obstacles. For the most part. Sometimes, it wasn't clear when you were looking for a specific objective, such as a remote or wireless port to ping or trace. 


[h1]Story[/h1] 
You're thrust into matters without any preamble explaining your background, motivation, relationships to anyone else, or what the world around you is like. It's too direct, as a small introduction would have helped ground events and my place in them. Seemingly, I'm a hacker of enough reputation to be worth given some replacement gear by Professor Ziggy, and start being approached for jobs by diverse groups. Taking jobs from so many unknowns might be risky, but so is hacking, and they pay well, which is what matters most. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3052249344
[h1]Visuals[/h1] 
Considering that the goal of a hacking game is for it to be fun, I don't see an issue with how simplistic the networks and computer systems are. They're definitely far messier than a few branching lines and hub points, but it's just enough visualization to engage players. Some clever choices make it so that only a few shapes and colors convey all the information that's needed to make snappy decisions as well. My issues stem more from the visuals not pertaining to the gameplay. 

NPCs are only represented by names, while the group they're part of only gets a symbol and title. It's hard to get any sense for who they are or the cause they back by only reading some text on screen. I knew different people and groups were talking to me, but I had a hard time keeping track or knowing if it mattered that much taking a job from one group over another. Considering how some of these interactions would take place in person, having more to look at and connect these names with would help. Of course, so would having a player avatar. 


[h1]Sound Design[/h1] 
I wouldn't say the music in SB is catchy, but it does suit the theme well, as it's largely made up of synthetic sounding beeps and boops. The music varies a bit, as the tunes don't feel like one song remixed multiple times, but without having a playlist to listen to, it's hard to know how many songs were composed for the game. Some of the tracks are louder and have more impact for it. However, the sound effects that you make are so frequent, it tends to stand out more. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3052249596
[h1]Pros[/h1] 
🌟 As long as you're not limiting yourself with a challenge run for achievements, the game is pretty easy. 
🌟 Depending on what tasks you struggle with, there's a program that can do them for you. 


[h1]Cons[/h1] 
❌ Even though there's regular tutorials throughout the game, it's not always clear exactly what they mean. For instance, for some time I didn't realize I could add more health back to my firewall. 
❌ Occasionally a new mechanic or threat is introduced, but it's hard to get a sense for your progression while playing through SB. There's no chapters or milestones to track. 
❌ It'd be nice if more cues were given when you achieved or failed optional objectives or changed status. You have to check yourself to really know. 


[h1]Tips[/h1]
🔍 Preventing the alertness from increasing and stopping hostile programs like RAM won't prevent all damage. Your firewall will slowly accumulate damage no matter what, but it doesn't mean you've done anything wrong or messed up.
🔍 You'll want to spread out your upgrades across a few areas, since you'll otherwise have no benefit in that ability. This would be a very hard game to tackle if you could only juggle two threads at a time.
🔍 Be aware of when a virus attack is detrimental or just a distraction. Sometimes it's not worth stopping what you're doing, while other times you have no choice. 


[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1] 
Usually, my complaints about a game have something to do with the gameplay, and although I wouldn't say it's without flaws, my larger problems with SB come from presentation. The gameplay starts feeling stale when every mission looks exactly the same. Plus, although your objectives will vary, how you go about them doesn't change significantly. Stealing data is close enough to turning off security or planting bugs that it begins blending together. More changes could have been made to the situations or what you needed to accomplish. Have someone request assistance bailing out a botched job, alter the time limit, emphasize a factor more than pure speed such as making no mistakes, etc. 

Storytelling suffers from much the same problem, as it only takes place through mission requests and short IMs reacting to your leet skills. A lack of cutscenes or any variety leads to a playthrough that starts wearing out its welcome. Although difficulty may be a factor, I believe its a sense of staleness that leads to only 14% of players finishing the campaign more than anything else. It doesn't help when you're starting to get into more serious matters, but it keeps getting stalled with side gigs. Unfortunately, I think this game falls a bit short, so I wouldn't recommend it. Not when so few people even finish it.

"As usual, the AAA price tag, plus 9€ for the editor (which should be in the game anyway, it's a goddamn console), doesn't come close to being justified by the ""new features"" and ""upgrades"" that this edition brings to the table over last year's. Precisely because of this do a lot of people only get every other game, such as every even numbered edition, rather than get every single one.

With that said, I do love the visual improvements to the matches. In terms of graphical fidelity, it's literally the same: looks like FM (like shit). However, the new animations are really good and make the game feel incredibly more immersive. It's something you really have to experience for yourself to really notice. The sad part is, for someone that has never played FM before, if they were to start now, with FM23, they'd still think the animations look ancient; because they do. At any rate, the new animations added to things like keeper distribution, heading, dribbling, touches, and even the net actually having physics now, make the game feel a lot more realistic. Regardless; yes, the new animations are a massive improvement, but the game still looks like it should've come out 15 years ago.

In terms of actual gameplay... it's still the same old FM. It doesn't feel much different. There are some match engine issues that still need fixing (especially on defense), but overall I do feel like this year's edition is slightly better than the previous one. You can still 4231 Gegenpress your way to the top with any team, but it does feel like the series is continuing down a trend of making life harder for the human player, tactically speaking, which I appreciate; although, of course, it's still largely the same FM veterans have come to expect, and won't really pose much of a challenge for any type of playthrough that isn't journeyman, or something thereabouts.

There's the new UEFA competitions license stuff, but who really cares about that? The music and fanfare around UCL competitions is nice and all, but it's a minuscule thing, and most people already used all kinds of packs and mods to make the game more realistic, by adding realistic competition names, logos, etc.

The main criticisms, by far, have to be the complete lack of changes to set pieces (unbelievable that they haven't been touched in years, and the current system doesn't even work properly), and the similar total absence of changes to international management, despite the game coming out weeks before a World Cup. It's baffling that neither of these features were touched, and, to me, really just shows how much the execs. in charge of decision-making care about the series and its playerbase. We are cows to be milked, and nothing more.

I got the game for around half-off (waited for sale + had a gift card lying around), and I think I'm fine with paying €30-something for the minor upgrade that is 23 over 22, since I know I'm gonna be getting hundreds or thousands of hours out of it.

To sum it up: for me, it's definitely an upgrade over 22, but it's a minuscule one that definitely doesn't justify the AAA price tag in the slightest. Even €30 might be pushing it; the only reason I think €30 is about fair is because I'm sure SI paid quite a lot for the UEFA licensing, but were we to talk solely about the effort put into new features and upgrades, even €30 might be a bit too much. So, in short, if you're a die-hard fan of FM, you'll feel at home, but if you get it at full price you'll probably feel robbed, like most people do.
If you're happy with 22, and/or the game doesn't get a big sale within the next 2 or 3 months (any more than that and the release of 24 starts to be close enough to justify just waiting for it), I'd probably just skip this edition. Of course, that is the exact same advice everyone gives everyone else, every year.

As always, I wish Steam had a ""meh"" option, rather than Yes or No. I'll give it a Yes, purely based on the fact that I am enjoying myself (it's FM, I love FM, what can I say?...), but the review speaks for itself.",0,1

"My first glace at this game came along with a thought, ""Why is this free?""... then i realized that it's a student project. 

In short, this game is blessed with the love of a very talented artist and art design crews. The artwork is simply gorgeous, even better than a lot of those big names commercial games i've seen. So, it's easy to say these guys can easily get a job as game devs or 3D animators as soon as they graduate, or, if a HR knows its stuff, would have recruited them way before their graduation. Artists of this nature and quality is hard to come by.

But, is the game good? Well... first of all, like all student games i've seen on Steam, they all have optimization problem, yes, the urge to fit everything into a scene is there for amateur developers, ending up with overkill of objects in a scene and that effect the overall performance of the game. This problem is here as well. Secondly, the UI design is simple, and keeping it simple is the way to go in most cases... but in this case, there's no option to disable ""Motion Blur"" and this means the game denied access to players that suffers from motion sickness, simply means they are asking for a thumbs down here. And when you combine motion blur with a bad optimization, it can REALLY cause nauseating experience. 3rdly, due to the above 2 reasons, I am not able to enjoy the game story at all with the screen going blur every time i touch the mouse (There's mouse sensitivity problem too, and no, we can't change that either), with all those dizziness i am surprise i didn't throw up. (Almost lose my lunch though... and i finally decided it's time to quit and move on to another game)

The Art crews are guaranteed to get a job after graduation with this presentation, but sadly not the coding crew or the rest of the crew, and i feel bad for the story writer because their efforts in story telling are killed by one single flaw the game director missed to address, and that's motion blur is not for everyone.  -- As for the school's reputation itself, if your students continues to have such mistakes on their presentation projects, it really makes me doubt the quality of the teachings they are doing in school.
