"The game itself is a perfectly fine autorunner. There's not a lot here, but what is here is solid. For 3 bucks, it's exactly what you pay for.

Below is my old review and has since been outdated. I'm keeping it here for record purposes..

That said, I'm giving this a negative review for bad faith advertisement.
-The capsule shows a realistic looking man, but the in game doesn't fit the game at all. If he's the protagonist, I can hardly tell.
-This game is an Autorunner and NOTHING in ""About"" section says that. Even the trailer doesn't say that. I thought it was just a small platformer, but once I found out they removed the means to let me control the character, I'm not interested. If other people want an autorunner, that's fine, but the steam page should say that.
-Also, because it's an auto runner, it says ""Simple two-button controls"", implying it's jump and attack. However, there's 3 buttons because the range attack you get in some levels has its own button. This is a nitpick

I don't want to sound harsh to a 3 dollar game. I just think it's wrong when it feels like the steam page is hiding key information. I'll give the developer the benefit of the doubt and assume it wasn't intentional, but I'm still refunding this game. Not because it's bad, but because I don't like autorunners. If the steampage changes to make it clear it's an autorunner, I'll switch this recommend.",0,1

This is the second game in Morning Shift's ""Hike"" series, and it's a [i]significant[/i] upgrade over the previous game. Don't get me wrong; it's still not a good game. But it's nice to see this developer improving.

Like the previous entry, this game is all about walking through the woods.  There's occasional text (that's hard to see due to poor font/color choices) from the character describing their thoughts, but otherwise there is no story. Aside from a few jumping puzzles and a single maze, there is no real gameplay either.

Compared to the previous game, the environments are [i]substantially[/i] more varied. Instead of the same two tree models and one grass sprite copy+pasted over and over, now there's about 10 tree models and 10 grass sprites copy+pasted over and over again, along with some bushes and rocks.  They've also started to include contextual clues throughout most of the game, though there are still parts where it's easy to get lost and just have to wander around.

The game took me exactly 20 minutes to beat.

Overall, I still don't think this is worth playing.  However I'm glad to see the developer improving, and look forward to their future projects being even better.",1,0

"i gave this game a thumbs up because it has potential, but the game feels designed for you to fail and start over in a continuous loop until you get lucky enough to actually win. While a challenge in a tycoon game is welcome, the profit to income magins in the game are too distant to actually win.
in 2 hours i went out of business twice lol 
The default coffees on the menu are apparently no one's favorite 
when you try to make a coffee, your employees make it terribly, they start out with horrible skill levels and you will go bankrupt trying to train them ontop of improving your shop.
you cant cover all hours with 4 employees because you dont make enough money to cover their pay 
you cant get more money because the employees work so slow that you lose customers when you finally start to get a line, the wait meter goes down very quickly with no clear way to increase it. 
While its a fun concept, the execution is a bit lacking and almost seems like its designed for you to fail. 
I want to like this game but right now i cant.

EDIT: i didnt realize i totally left out what i liked about the game, im really sorry about that. 
Here's what i loved about the demo, the absolutely freedom to customize your shop, and the coffee costumization options. i did the tutorial first and i loved that location a little bit more than the underwater one in the actual game because of the building design and layout. I wish i could have chosen a layout before starting out the underwater version. 
When making my coffee's i had a lot of fun coming up with the various combinations, to make my own unique coffees. also i liked the different styles of furniture, and painting on the walls and floors you can go with. 

I also loved that we could change the font of our Logo of our coffee shops and have a unique identity in the game's world. 

What i liked but didnt love, was the cup options, i wish there were more unique options, i tended to go for the more unorthodox cup designs over the typical ones because it made the designs feel more fun and unique to my shop. Also, i liked the various coffee machine styles, but i do wish we could upgrade our starting coffee machine so it has the Milk Frother instead of having to spend so much on the 2nd Coffee machine. 

What i would like to see in the future is being able to have multiple registers open to cash people out so when a line starts to happen with customers (which is supposed to be a good thing because you're getting traction) you can get people their product faster, without losing customers.",0,1

🟢 Random events, quick runs 8 min + boss battle
🟡 To be honest, in its current state, the game is pretty mediocre in every aspect.
It pretends to be a rogue lite, but I don't feel like it's progressing because you can't make any upgrades outside run. if you die, you get nothing. Just hope that random is on your side. There are not so many weapons and they are not particularly effective and spectacular.
Some maps are too big, you can see the chest on the map, but it takes literally one minute to get to it.
The user interface is not friendly.
Random events are a cool mechanic, but sometimes I had the same event 5 times in a row. And it's annoying.

💬 The game has its own mechanics and is in early access, so I hope that the developers will continue to work on the game. In its current state, the game doesn't have much content and needs to be polished but it has potential.",0,1

[h3]Graphics:[/h3]
If the first world was quite okay for me (even if it sometimes feels a bit ""too simple""), the second world gave me a bad trip. From an open map, the 2nd world gave me an impression of thightness and was quite disturbing. 
I can imagine that the graphics are limited due to the retrictions of the project. But I think it should be a point to be careful, especially when they are ""simple"". The colors, contrasts, animations and else are important.
I also put a trigger warning about the world 3, it brought some lags with the new mechanic. 

[h3]Audio:[/h3]
The audio was quite okay, I didn't get bored of it but I think it could be a bit more catchy.
Same for the sound effects, it was quite simple.

[h3]Gameplay:[/h3]
Let's enter in the main topic:
There are lots of troubles. Let's start with the [s]controls[/s]. I played the first world and the first level of the 2nd world with a controler, but it fast became problematic. The speed of the target is quite slow on a controler and the enemies are moving quite fast at some steps. It would be quite nice to take that in account. I had to switch to the keyboard+mouse combo to continue to the world 3. But if that was the only ""bad"" point. I think the point that will trigger most of you is the [s]collisions[/s]. And I mean in a general way: Collisions with your spaceship (the collision box is bigger than what we are seeing?), collisions of the bosses (you are on the boss target, but the bullets are going on the side),... The problem is that the gameplay is based on ""accurate"" shoots. The more you miss, the slower your bullet rate. And it's a double punition on some levels =/ That should be something to review a bit. I mean, the 2nd boss touched me once and I nearly died instantly.
Another point that is a bit triggering is the BIIIIIIG life of the bosses. Why are they so long? The different phases are seen.... yes....you will have enough time to see the different phases of the boss. The problem of the accuracy added to the big life of the boss makes the fight quite long. Unnecessarily long. Please, think about your players, they want to have fun :')
And since we are talking about the players, why do we see each time the cinematic at the beginning of a level? Once was okay, maybe add an option to skip when you already saw it.


[h3]Conclusion:[/h3]
The project is at the level of it's origins: a student project. I still think it could be a nice game with more time and investments on it but for the moment, I wouldn't recommend it for the moment.",1,0

"Neat little game. I really, really like the established environment. the contrast between the pastel lobby area, which is connected to a garden fueled by blood. However, I feel like the first half of the game goes by too fast. Everything in the hotel is so intriguing, but before you can truly enjoy this new world, the 2nd half comes up, and it feels disjointed. While the game never really holds your hand, the 2nd half really lacks direction. It would be fine if there was more to explore, but with no new areas initially, it makes the rest of the act fall flat. The basement puzzle is unintuitive, and this great new world starts to feel hollow. after the basement, the game becomes fairly linear, and the game leaves you with more questions than answers. I really, really hope this game gets an update or something, because I love the setting and I want to explore more, but as it stands, I really don't have any desire to replay this game.",0,1

"This is a review that's primed for a neutral rating. Not quite thumbs up and not totally down.

I've been playing this game since Early Access and loved it. The paid DLC on the other hand has been a huge let down.

So is it terrible? No. The content is good it's just that there's so little of it. For the price I expected double what we got.

Let me start with the gripe before the good:
The levels we got felt... smaller? rushed? For example on the clocktower map, there are 2 ""rooms"" to clean (The front of the building and the belltower room), linking those two rooms is an entry room and a staircase room which aren't part of the cleaning. That just feels lazy, making those two rooms dirty would have at least extended the level a bit as what's there took almost no time to clean. It took me less than 2 hours to complete the dlc (Solo, not using the trident attachment)
They had such great detail on the town and it's just sorta wasted.

The good: If you're a Back  to the Future fan you'll enjoy all the little kicks. The attention to detail was pretty spot on. For the first time there's some neat stuff that happens after you finish cleaning the vehicles.
No weird limits on your tools aka you can use the Trident attachment.
That's pretty much it.

"I played this game during a free playtest week. While I enjoyed the game and would recommend it, there are definitely a few glaring issues. 

Performance. The game runs fine at a stable 60fps but the amount of input lag, rubber banding and bugs i encountered leave me less confident.
The playerbase is small, really small. Often there would only be 10 people playing, total, across all servers. For a game such as this, this is the biggest issue and can leave a game dead before it even launches.
Next is the bugs. Getting stuck on terrain, wall clipping, XP not being given or being reset. I leveled to lvl 17 4 times before it finally ticked over to level 18, and at least half the games, It would show me getting xp, but none of the bars would move.
Lastly, the price. For a game like this, It would be perfect as a free to play game, but at $40 AUD, it is way overpriced for what it is.
This game is good and fun, and a lot of the issues do feel like things which can be fixed over time, but how it is now, I would only play it if it went f2p",0,1

"After playing for around 2.5 hours I can say that I am excited to see where this goes, but do not think it has had enough time in the oven as is. 

This game is fun in a lot of ways and really frustrating in others and not for the reason you think. Enemies don't have collision with each other and most of their attacks advance them towards you so they just kind of end up in a big pile you have to poke at until it's dead and a lot of the fighting gets interrupted by the wonky physics which catch on the enemies arms and legs a lot. The main reason it feels so off is because the enemies don't adhere to the physics like you do. They can swing through walls, each other, etc. which causes combat to feel very cluttered and messy. 

If you enjoy things that are unfinished this is a solid start and worth the investment to see what it becomes, but if you get easily frustrated with messy physics implementation and poor enemy balance you're gonna have some roadblocks. Nothing this game has thrown at me has been too frustrating to deal with outside of the engine issues which is how I know with time it will be more than worth the 25 they are currently asking (at time of this review).",1,0

The art style and concept is nice but thats all this game really has. The AI is horrible and ruins the immersion a ton and the story is too complicated and detailed, especially for being around a 40 minute game. Voice acting was sub-par but definitely good for an indie project, however the characters talk slow as hell and I found myself skipping the dialogue a ton because I didn't want to wait 10 seconds for a character to say one line. Also putting a heavy story-driven game with these kind of graphics didn't really match well together for whatever reason.

"[h2] Brief Personal History with Dragon Quest Dai [/h2]
I am someone who grew-up with the original [b] 1991 Dragon Quest Dai anime, aka ""Dai no Daibouken"" [/b] (practically MY CHILDHOOD) and it was also my all time favorite anime back in the 90s. The only regret I have about the original anime is that it wasn't finished and had stopped at episode 46 (REALLY wish they continued it to the end back then). And yes, I'm aware of the 2020 anime remake (I remember crying when I saw that announcement), but sadly, in terms of ""comparable episodes"" (i.e. The original anime's 46 episodes vs the remake anime's 25 episodes), the remake anime PALES IN COMPARISON to the original anime and cannot compete whatsoever in terms of action sequences (particularly against main villains) and ESPECIALLY in the music department.

While it was a ""dream come true"" for me when a video game of my favorite 90s anime was announced, unfortunately, ""Infinity Strash: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai"" turned out to be [b] a major disappointment [/b] overall. Below are the main cons and pros that I can say about this game, having completed the main game (and the side dungeon along the way):

[h3] Cons: [/h3]
1) [b] Main complain - Story Presentation: [/b] The story of this game (and majority of its ""gameplay"") is just a [b] visual novel [/b] that is told through multiple narrated ""still-images"" that have been ripped off straight from the 2020 anime remake and that's basically how most main points of the story are told for the entirety of the game. Needless to say, having already watched the whole 2020 anime remake before playing this game, it was a ""grueling experience"" to sit through all those cutscenes and whether I skipped them or not, the fact is that majority of this game is just these anime-ripped cutscenes that neither serve anime fans (because of how poorly the story is told through them) nor the video game fans who just want to play the game rather than sitting around, doing nothing while being bombarded with all those anime cutscenes for most of the game.

2) [b] Explorable Areas: [/b] It is even sadder that, when you FINALLY get to the ""gameplay"" part, most of playable locations are either [b] short-length levels [/b] with boring/bland backgrounds and barely anything to do besides killing a few monsters before reaching the end of the level OR [b] boss arenas [/b] where you are immediately get thrown into a boss battle, which simply RUINS the ""build-up"" to the boss battle that you would normal get from other games where you actually ADVENTURE through a long level, leading into the boss room/area.

3) [b] Combat: [/b] As for the combat itself, it's very basic and to me is RUINED by the inclusion of annoying [b] cooldowns [/b] for skills (which are especially frustrating when enemies interrupt you and then you have to WAIT AGAIN until the cooldown is over to be able to attack again), while the dodge/guard feel very ""unresponsive/sluggish"" that led me to take A LOT OF DAMAGE for absolutely no reason even when I pressed the buttons at the correct time. I really feel like a ""Kingdom Hearts-style"" gameplay with a side menu and ""HP/MP bar"" would have been the right combat system for this game as an ""action RPG"".

4) [b] Game Music: [/b] The overall music for the most part is simply TERRIBLE and is mainly taken from 2020 anime remake (which, as I said at the beginning, PALES in comparison to the original 1991 anime's soundtrack). The only exception is maybe the ""World Map Music"" which actually sounds ""decent/catchy"" so I didn't mind that one in particular, but the rest of the music would have been better off being [b] new original music [/b] that should have been made specifically for the video game adaptation IMO.

5) [b] Temple of Recollection side dungeon: [/b] I saw other reviewers claim that this was the ""highlight"" of this game, but to me, it had its own set of issues that made it another ""tedious"" aspect of this game such as being:
- [b] Repetitive [/b] for both regular monsters and main bosses.
- [b] Extremely long to get to the end with NO ""Quick Saves"" [/b] to be able to resume at a later point.
- [b] Unforgiving in that there are NO REVIVES [/b] during the entirety of the run, so if a character dies, you either have to continue at a MAJOR DISADVANTAGE (i.e. by making all subsequent battles longer/more tedious) OR quit the dungeon run at the earliest point possible and start over again with a full party (oh, and if your entire party dies or you quit mid-way through the floor, you LOSE all the rewards you gained to that point).
- [b] Many frustrating enemies, [/b] ESPECIALLY those stupid ""exploding rocks"" that self-destruct and OHKO one of your characters, forcing you more than likely to quit and start over because of the disadvantage that you have to deal with afterwards. This is even extra frustrating when those self-destructing rocks kill one of the ""AI-controlled"" party members (so even when it is not your fault, the game STILL punishes you for things that are out of your hands).

[h3] Pros: [/h3]
1) Character 3D Models look actually nice in-game.
2) Elemental aspects like ""Fire, Water, Lightning, etc..."" look gorgeous.
3) As such, combining points 1+2, ""Ultimate Attacks"" for both good and evil characters look badass.
4) Also, the few [b] IN-GAME rendered cutscenes [/b] (using the game's engine) that generally play after defeating major bosses look AMAZING and really made me wish that THIS was how the overall story was told (along with properly constructed ""adventuring levels"") for a better story experience.

[h2] Conclusion: [/h2]

Overall, ""Infinity Strash: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai"" video game didn't get the treatment (and budget) it deserved. The terrible presentation of its story as well as the primitive/shallow gameplay just didn't feel engaging or worth the $60 price tag (probably worth $15 AT MOST). Even as a long-time fan of the original 1991 Dragon Quest Dai anime, I suggest that you [b] skip this game entirely [/b] and maybe consider watching the existing anime adaptations if you are interested in the story of ""Dai"" himself and that's that.

[b] Final Rating: 4/10. [/b]",1,0

"Zen absolutely nailed the atmosphere and visuals of The Thing with this table. Just top tier stuff in that department. Gameplay however is a mixed bag. The missions are well done and easy to follow but there's something really unsatisfying about the flow of the table. The majority of it is a MASSIVE empty field which I guess is thematically accurate but doesn't make for fun play. This also makes it pretty tough to make just about any shot due to the massive amount of space between your flippers and any ramps which seem really small.

Is it a good The Thing table? Absolutely. Is it a good table when taken just for gameplay? Ehhh maybe not so much but they seem to be making changes to help things.",0,1

I like to support game developers so I'm not going to give it a negative review, but I am really unsure if I can recommend it, and I feel like I kinda don't.

"Solid base, but lots of cracks in the gem. The balance is all over the place, with some classes being effectively overshadowed by others, and most classes having multiple abilities that are just ""deal x damage"". If I had to guess, it was designed as a Darkest Dungeon clone and then backfilled from there, which can cause issues if you don't account for the design reasons for the various bits and bobs brought over from DD. Statuses barely scale, and the trinkets that give ""+X BLEED damage"" only affect the incidental direct damage of the ability that also gives bleed, for example, not the bleed damage itself. This is fine I guess, aside from being unclear, but this also means that every status-applying ability that DOESN'T do damage isn't affected by those status damage trinkets.

There's also the choice of having bosses go after every ally, meaning larger parties are usually worse than smaller parties, especially since most bosses seem to have AoE attacks. This behavior is similar to XCOM 2's DLC bosses, but anyone who has played that DLC knows how fraught the difficulty is by breaking a game's otherwise concrete action economy. Plus that game has more tools to deal with a single target as a party, unlike this game.

That said, the feel of the game is pretty good. I wouldn't mind a bit more detail on the smaller enemies, even if that means making them larger, because a lot of the lil guys look nearly identical. But I dig the Game Boy style of the game, it fits a game like this.

I am giving this a thumbs down, but it's very close to being a slight thumbs up. If it had a few balance passes to clean up the scaling, or even better add some diversity to the class moves (or remove/consolidate some of the seemingly extraneous classes), it would tip the scale.",1,0
"For whatever reason doesn't have 1:1 mapping with the desktop mouse speed. This throws my control off a lot to the point of being frustrating.

EDIT: The developer has updated the game so this is no longer an issue and I commend them for their swift development to resolve a (imho) gamebreaking bug.

Given that, I now think this game is a fun relaxation game for those that find these sort of games fun. Despite that, at least for me, I still feel the repetition is too high where I'm bored before finishing even one artwork.",1,0

"First off, the RTX makes this mod look great. And it's a free mod, so I absolutely won't judge it as harshly as a paid product. But if you're making a mod for one of the greatest puzzle games of all time, I would expect the puzzles to be better. The puzzles aren't difficult because they have clever solutions, they're difficult because the solutions require nearly perfect timing and execution. Most of the time, solving a chamber felt like luck instead of critical thinking. With nearly every chamber I found myself asking ""Are they really going to make me do that? Or is there a fun, clever solution that I just haven't figured out yet?"" And each time the answer was yes, they're really going to make you do that. 
I should also mention that a lot of the puzzles are momentum-based. Jumping into portals, quickly placing new portals, flying around, etc. The slow camera rotation in Portal (which was fixed for Portal 2) makes these puzzles really disorienting and frustrating. The test chambers are often really tight with no room for error, so this movement ended up giving me a headache after just a few chambers.

There's a puzzle really early on that I assumed I was doing incorrectly. Then, a text box popped up and told me that if I was having trouble building momentum to solve the chamber, I should go into my settings and disable portal funneling. [b]Devs: If so many playtesters have trouble with a puzzle that you feel the need to insert popup text that instructs people to change their game settings to solve it, you've designed a puzzle that sucks.[/b]

Overall, it's a cool showcase of rtx technology and community love for Portal, but also a showcase of how well-designed valve's puzzles are. I appreciate the effort that went into this mod, but I think the puzzles themselves are poorly made.",1,0

[h1]Introduction:[/h1]
A short, child-friendly hidden object game where you pan across a fairly small summery scene, Hidden Bunny is decent, but in no way memorable or outstanding. 

[h3]Summary:[/h3]
[B]Performance:[/b]
• RAM: 16GB Dual-Channel DDR4 @ 1600MHz
• CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700U with 512MB ATI AMD Radeon Graphics
• Storage: WD 500GB SSD

Hidden Bunny was playable on highest graphics, but far smoother on lowest. My laptop got pretty warm, but this runs fine on low-end hardware.

[b]Positives:[/b]
•	Pleasant graphics on high settings
•	Achievements. Easy 100%
[b]Note:[/b] For now, and until it meets engagement criteria (e.g enough people buying it) the achievements won’t count to your profile completion stats).

[b]Negatives:[/b]
•	No manual saving
•	No hints
•	Forced to collect things in order

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
Hidden Bunny is surprisingly pretty given its low price. It has four presets - the lowest dramatically different to the highest. It presented a sunny, warm, peaceful atmosphere that was pleasing on the eyes. The placement of hidden objects makes some use of camouflage, size, and positioning in the environment occasionally, but for the most part makes no real effort to conceal anything. I had trouble finding one rabbit who was small and from most angles poorly contrasted with a part of the environment that took me a while to find, but otherwise this game is quite easy and its visual presentation is fine.

[h1]Audio:[/h1]
The soundscape is unremarkable. Writing this review the following day I’ve totally forgotten the music and recall only bare minimum environmental sounds emanating from various animals. They’re just functional. I make no complaint here, but also offer no praise.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
A simple matter of using WSAD to pan across the scene, the mouse wheel to zoom, and the mouse button to select, constitutes all there is to the gameplay of Hidden Bunny. This you will repeat for around half an hour to an hour in a bid to find various collections of hidden objects.

One thing that bothered me when I played was that though there are several categories of hidden objects here (bunnies, crocodiles, toucans, etc) you are not able to select them as you see them. You are required to find all bunnies, then all toucans, etc. I understand this may primarily be to present a challenge, but I didn’t like it as it artificially drags the game on. Compare this with other hidden object games like this where you have various items in one scene (Hidden Paws, 100 hidden x series, etc.) which place no such limitation - I preferred their approach in this respect.

There are also no manual saves. You must complete the current goal or lose its progress which accounts for some 20ish minutes of my game time. And there’s no hint feature to help. In terms of the actual control of the game… it is rough around the edges, but passable. Quality of life features, though, are a little lacking, which made my experience a bit less enjoyable.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
While having hints would be nice, Hidden Bunny isn’t really difficult enough to warrant it. The only two things that really count against the game for me are the lack of manual saving, and the requirement to find items in a category order the game imposes. Neither thing is actually game-breaking though, and so my overall review is just barely positive since Steam’s binary forces my hand. It is pretty enough to look at, it has easy achievements, and is a casual way to pass an hour or so. It’s decent, but also nothing special.

"[b] Im a big Alien fan [/b] 

Ellen Ripley is one of my favorite most badass female action heroes of all time.
You can imagine how exited i was to play not only as a Xenomorph but as Ellen too! 
Only that the character in this game looks nothing like Sigourney Weaver. 
But the community is defending this. Arguing that the likeness of Sigourney herself was possibly to expensive to get like with Quentins actor from the nightmare chapter. Only that Laurie Strode, Ashley Williams and Nicolas cage were'nt?
Sometimes i feel like this community swallows up everything Bhvr throws at them. Like the embarrassing movement animations on the Resident Evil Legion Hunk skin.

Some of the animations regarding getting out the turret from its printstation or picking up and carrying survivors as the xenomorph look a bit clunky. Overall everything is pretty to look at though. 
Especially the Alienqueen skin is gorgeous! But ofc every skin is locked to a set. So you have to buy the entire skin and not only a piece you like. Another outfit for Ripley is exclusive for buying the DLC in its entirety. Which is pretty bad when you think about people not playing killer at all and are now forced into buying the whole thing if they want the skin. Scummy.

After 7 years Behaviour finally got around to add the brand new technology V-Sync to the game.
Which for some reason sets the fps on my 244 hz monitor to 100 fps. 
You can cap the fps manually ofc. Only to 120 fps that is. But this actually limits the fps to what it says. That has apparently something to do with the engine? i don't know.
I dont know how you make this not work in 2023.

I overall like this DLC but in an ocean of praise from this community i feel like i have to speak up and point out the flaws and some sloppy things.
Yes i bought it instantly and now im bi*ching about stuff but thats just because i love Alien 1 and 2 so much. I want this to be as polished as possible.

The game has a lot of potential to be a fun and engaging story but there is a very awkward difficulty jump early on and, at least at that point, there is no way to grind previous battles or fight any kind of random battles to level up your dudes when you're feeling stuck. The 'tasks' don't provide nearly enough of a pittance considering how long each battle takes whether you win or lose and you don't keep any of the experience you gained during battles lost.

Fleshed out more with a way to grind levels and this would be a definite yes from me.

"Improves on a lot over thief simulator, but still has many of the very hard-to-ignore control problems the first game had.
- You frequently struggle to walk over small ridges in the terrain. If a platform is 0.5 inches higher than you, you have to jump to get on it.
- You have to look DIRECTLY at something to interact with it. Want to get in you car? Try looking at the car. Not working? Try looking at the driver's side door. STILL not working? Try looking specifically at the handle. I don't know what reason they forced this precision, but it doesn't add to the enjoyment or immersion.
- Movement is jerky to start when you press the buttons and slowly trundles to a stop when you let go. Other games manage to make you feel like you have momentum without it being so uncomfortable.

I'm glad to see they've improved a lot over the first game. A lot of interactions are a lot cleaner. You can see how full an item will make your backpack. Looking at an NPC will show you their schedule. All of the fine details have been polished somewhat.
The graphics are a lot better too, but that was never what made the original game feel good.

They've managed to keep that addictive core of sneaking around people's houses and sticky-fingering lots of little valuables, and I'm glad they haven't lost the core of their enjoyment. But if they can't fix basic movement issues from the first game, I'm not going to spend money to buy the same problems a 2nd time.

"Some innovative things, but still a RPG-Maker game at the end of the day.

The first thing to mention is that the game was created using RPG Maker, a well-known tool for generating similar games. If you've ever played something like this, you'll know what to expect. Combat is turn-based, generic and slow. The main problem with these games is a lack of innovation in terms of graphics, user interface, and even story.

It's a rip-off of any JRPG out there. Every game has the same assets, character pictures, control system, and constraints, such as poor resolution and hidden buttons that might cause the game to crash without warning. 

If you can look past the warning above, you’ll find a very strange game. It’s very hard to place it in a specific genre because there’s a bit of everything. The first thing you’ll notice is that, with the exception of basic ground and wall textures, everything has some kind of interaction. Most is obvious and you will either examine things or talk to people, but there are also trees you can knock down, patches of earth that le you plant things, flowers and many other things.

The unique thing is connected to NPCs. Everyone has something to say, perhaps they have a quest, they might join your party or you might even kill them. Bad actions have consequences to your karma, which apparently has no effect on the gameplay. Sometimes it’s fine to do something bad. Stealing, for instance, will give you something good and increase your thieving skills. Killing people also isn't bad because you'll have a lot of fun with necromancy skill.

There are a bunch of skills you can increase by simply doing things. They resemble those from survival games, but here you don’t need to worry about eating or sleeping. There’s crafting, which is important for creating useful items such as axe for cutting down trees and torches for dark locations, foraging, cooking and several others. 

The interface is the worst element of the entire experience. To check stats, craft, or do anything else, you need the proper skill from the inventory, which takes you to a new screen. To exit that screen, choose the skill from the inventory again. It's a mess.

The game has a lot of achievements. Except for the hassle you need to go through to see them, they're actually quite good because they're organized by region and include hints on how to obtain them.",0,1

"I do not recommend this game for most players. I DO recommend it ONLY for skilled players who are looking for something challenging.
Actually, the basic gameplay is not so very challenging, but after a while the accumulation of monsters is so great that it turns into simply trying to avoid the huge horde while still trying to kill some. Not such an easy thing any more.
At the start, leveling up is pretty fast, but when I got up to level fifty-something, it was a pretty slow grind because of much attention spent on avoiding the large group. I had to attack smaller groups and fight them until the horde caught up with me, then more avoidance tactic. Also, at that level it was not so easy to kill them. Earlier levels they went down quickly and the XP gathered added up fast. At levels after 50, most kills did not drop XP or any other drops, so adding up the XP for another level sometimes used up many minutes.
I finally crawled up to level 56, but by then I suppose my fingers were starting to get rather tired and stiff. Inevitably my fingers started hitting the wrong keys, and at one point I couldn't get back in alignment and was killed before I could move to safety.
I don't think I am going back for any more of that. I don't normally play the survivors type game, anyway.",1,0

"Payday 3: A Disastrous Heist

I recently picked up Payday 3 with high hopes, given my love for the previous titles in the series. However, after spending some time with the game, I can confidently say that it has been nothing short of a disappointment. Payday 3 is a buggy mess that runs terribly, and it's filled with <missing string entry> that ruin the overall experience.

Let's start with the bugs. From the moment I launched the game, it was clear that the developers at Overkill Studios had not put in the necessary time and effort to ensure a polished release. Graphical glitches, crashes, and performance issues plague Payday 3. Frame rates drop to unplayable levels, making even the simplest heists a frustrating endeavor. It's as if the game is trying to rob you of your patience instead of letting you enjoy the heist.

But the most unforgivable aspect of Payday 3 is the presence of <missing string entry>. It's shocking to see such a basic and fundamental issue in a game of this caliber. Key information, dialogue, and crucial mission details are simply missing, leaving players confused and disconnected from the storyline. It's like trying to complete a puzzle with half of the pieces missing.

The sound design is equally problematic. Gunfire sounds are inconsistent, and the music is forgettable at best. The lack of polish in this department further contributes to the feeling that Payday 3 was rushed to market without proper quality control.

The AI in Payday 3 is another major letdown. Teammates and enemies alike behave erratically, often making the game feel more like a chaotic circus than a tactical heist. This lack of intelligent AI detracts from the immersion and strategic depth that the series was once known for.

In conclusion, Payday 3 is an unmitigated disaster. It's riddled with game-breaking bugs, performs terribly on even high-end systems, and the presence of <missing string entry> issues is inexcusable. This game feels like it was released in a half-baked state to capitalize on the franchise's popularity, and it's a slap in the face to loyal fans who were expecting a worthy successor to the previous titles. I would strongly advise against wasting your time and money on this broken mess of a game.",0,1
"it was alright. to be fully honest, i think it should have been free. I screamed one time but other than that the monsters weren't scary at all. the aesthetic was really cool though and the ui was fantastic. i liked that they gave options for what kinda visual effect you wanted on at the time. the actually visuals of the game were pretty solid. definitely liminal. But tbh i feel like since they went for the scary route, they should have focused more on that. it seemed really half assed in that area. In conclusion, the game was okay. Was it worth the money equivalent to a burger? well if they added more content and made it more scary, then i would say yes. But as of now, i would probably eat the burger.",1,0

"04OCT23 Review

This DLC seems to be the 'success' that PGI has been needing for a while. That being said, I still recommend you buy this on sale as PGI still only released a slim-budget product. All real effort went into the 15x Mission Campaign.

The specific items:
Campaign - This is one of the better campaigns I have experienced.  The starting 'Mechs are a great mix, weapon and 'Mech market availability is good, starting inventory is well-established, starting money makes you have agency, but not able to fund a whole new line-up. Missions are decently laid out and engaging. Story/Lore is a great peek at ComStar feeding the Kuritans against the FedCom Alliance with more entwined story pieces. This is a particular win for the Lore-Junkie-'Mech-Jockeys. Somehow, this is the best part.

Battlemechs: 5x Longbow, 6x OTOMO Variants of other Chassis.

Longbow - A Great Back-Line Missile Support 'Mech. All 5x variants are materially the same. Some will just have more Laser slots. Other than that, big hit box 'arms' to make sure your missile launchers are hit. This is extremely lazy and could have been augmented with another 'Mech release. I like me a Missile-boat, but come on.

Otomo - Essentially Kuritan Royal Guard Variants with all the awesome LosTech upgrades you could want. In Vanilla MW5:Mercs, that means you just have a standard weapon load with max-ish armor, a bunch of Heatsinks (doubles mainly) and Ammo slotted. I consider these variants essential demi-hero-'Mechs, which point for point, probably could out perform their Hero-Variant counter-parts. No doubt, Modders will vary this up more with internals, engine sizes, and other sweet gear to make these variants be more descriptive and enjoyable to customize.

Free Update - Instant Action fight arena with friends and teams. This could be better completed by redoing MW4 Solaris Arena, making it a mode with George Ledoux as Duncan Fisher narrating arena events. Ultimately, not a 'Free Update', more like, ""We added a feature you probably did not know about"".

Again, in summary: Buy on Sale; Campaign - Good 'nuff; Longbow - Lazy Yawn; Otomo - Hero-contenders; Free Update - Where?",1,0

"As hard as I've tried to like this game and appreciate the effort into it this experience quickly becomes monotonous and excruciating. The walk speed is already moderately slow but the stamina bar disappears painfully quickly for the large map. Instead of being suspenseful or stressful it ends up being ""do this task"" five times and end your shift while glancing over your shoulder until you're out of danger. After the first couple nights there's significantly less items to choose from so it becomes a goose chase around the map to find them. The concept is lovely, the writing of the two characters and the voice acting shows great potential to be a unique concept but it's overshadowed by the current state of the game. I wish the developers luck in their progression and I believe in The Night Shift's capability of growth.",0,1

"I found the drones annoying to use. Controls need to switch to controlling the drones, not the operators, when in drone mode, without switching back to non-drone mode when a drone dies. My stupid operators kept charging forward when their drone died because of the way grouping works (i.e. attacking the next target with a group of drones will order any drone operators without drones that are a part of the group to attack as well instead of simply standing there and making a new drone to join the grouping). This makes no sense from a combat perspective. Drone operators would never charge into live combat like that. The whole point is to strike from a distance. The current design has way too much cumbersome and unnecessary micro-management that adds no value to the unit or to combat.

I also did not like the marking vehicle (can't remember what it is called). When I activated the marking feature, the stupid vehicle would charge forward into the line of fire and attack, leaving the rest of my forces behind. Kamakazi is a poor design choice in a combat unit that is presented as an information gatherer. I used one of the things twice just to see what it would do and never used it again during the rest of the mission (i also never saw any information that it was supposed to gather, but have no idea if that was because it didn't meet the qualifying criteria or if it was because the features aren't active yet in the demo).

The ""lip sync"" issue was a problem for me because it kept me from paying attention to whatever the character was trying to say during the briefing and then set the tone for the rest of the gaming experience.

The final issue I have is a lack of a formalized feedback mechanism for playing the demo. If one exists, there was no obvious mention of it on the launch page in Steam (and this forum is not an optimum tool for targeted feedback). It makes the whole demo effort seemed rushed and unprofessional, which then calls into question the overall status of the game and time frame for release.

That all being said, I definitely see the similarity with the old C&C games in the overall look and feel. I think I also hear some Starcraft-esque voice clips for some of the units. I love the old C&C 3 games (and SC, for that matter) and drag them out every once in a while to replay them (and I hope that EA does a refresh on them sometime soon). So if Tempest Rising can replicate the gameplay and feel of the old titles, I am all for it. I look forward to the next iteration of the demo version and remain cautiously optimistic regarding a final end product.",0,1
"[h1]Wellington's [url=store.steampowered.com/app/1874220/GO/]GO[/url] mixes elements of brick breaker and pool in a relaxing minimalist package but lacks thoughtful strategic design.[/h1]

Break the whites and bounce off on blacks. Some pieces move, most are static.

With a mirror effect on screen edges, most of the 100 puzzles are either easy one-shot solves or fall into the trial-and-error category. You can let some levels run for 2 whole minutes and just watch the ball bounce off randomly until it clears all the pieces. Coupled with the occasional glitch, this makes solving puzzles rather unsatisfying.

For the tougher levels, I would have liked to see my last move's position before attempting another correction.

Go presumably took strong inspiration from Kamibox Games' more polished [i]Okay?[/i]. Okay is more musical and has more diverse elements (such as strings that make sounds but don't disappear). Go relies on screen mirroring to solve its puzzles while Okay does not. Yet the similarities are otherwise striking beyond coincidence, both in terms of concept and presentation.

[*] Nice minimalist aesthetic
[*] Relaxing
[*] Very affordable

"As many who bought this game, I came here after Hyper Light Drifter entered my favorite games of all time list.

Solar Ash isn't bad on its own. But nowadays, so many games are just that so it ends up being forgettable.

I think that while a lot of the same elements are back, the very cohesion of it all that made HLD blew my mind isn't there on this project. Because the game is different, the same formula actually misses its target. For example I think Disasterpeace fits completely with the mystery and cryptic narration of HLD but after one playthrough there was no moment in SA that I remember his music to have hit me. Maybe the fact that there are dialogues? very defined visual elements in a 3D world as opposed to pixel-art?
Hard to tell.

Once again, it's still enjoyable so if you want to play it, then play it because you will probably enjoy something in it. But if you're expecting to buy a masterpiece, it's not.

"First of all, I'm not giving this a thumbs down for the game itself. I think it's a nice game for the most part. However, the game has a fairly big issue in it. For some reason, the game will close on it's own after a set period of time. There's no warning or anything, and I find myself needing to save often so I don't lose progress. Also, I encountered an error message sometimes that forced me to hit F5 to restart as well. 

This game is interesting, but the constant closing of the game can lead to frustration. Hope the Dev can fix the issues someday.",1,0

"[h1]Beautiful Singing Boys recruiting…So, let the Squid Game begin, boy band edition![/h1]
Hanbyul is a young girl with a dream… She wishes to have the opportunity to be at the center of the spotlight with an audience enjoying her songs. Thing is… Life is never easy, and she will have to do everything within her power to overcome debts and also her grandma’s hospital bills, on top of that. So, in order to guarantee a good source of income covering all their needs. She decides to participate in a contest in which a boy band is looking for a new member to join their ranks, as a way of killing two birds with one stone.
The protagonist decides to crossdress as a boy to have a chance and win the cash offered in the aforementioned contest. Leading her into a living situation that could feel similar to the TV show called Big Brother… But the Korean edition.

You can choose between some options for your preferred disguise, three available for hairstyle and other three as per choosing an outfit of your liking. A little funny graphic issue I spotted before the game was patched, made me think: If you want to really disguise yourself as a boy, never forget about finding a way for your b00bs not to bounce around giving your disguise away!

The plot most of the time is really easy to guess, with not so much of a plot twist to offer to the reader, and also the way of rushing the available routes as to try making you feel aware of them, feels, like, imposed and sometimes ridiculous, as the situation unfolding couldn’t be the worst timing ever for that to happen.
[spoiler]Her grandma is in a hard condition regarding her own health and the doctor is interested in asking for your number because he wants to take you out on a date… While what you wanted is a way to ensure that once the surgery costs are paid, the treatment for your closest relative will start and proceed as promised. And that’s only one of the examples you can encounter[/spoiler]
Her self-image can change a bit drastically sometimes… Going from having confidence in her own abilities to almost feeling like there’s no possible way she can do it. And that would be understandable, as it sometimes can happen in real life, but within minutes, changing her thinking so much is hard to empathize with.

There’s no skip button available nor a way to rewind the conversations or check the log, and given the fact there’s only one save slot available per walkthrough… You should be careful with your choices!
The background music in general, but more so the one trying to portray tension in the scenes unfolding ( the aforementioned, a bit excessive to be honest), can be cut out suddenly once the scene finishes… Which gained, more than once, one of my eyebrows rising at the abruptness.
One thing I would like to praise the game for, is the portrayal of the so-called Korean Wave or Hallyu, hard working conditions. Usually, all we see is glitter and not the pressure conditions the artists have to constantly endure… Even though within the game they touched the subject in a subtle way, it is good to see the problem being mentioned.

The romantic interests available:
[list]
[*]Cho Jin: The uptight guy who cannot keep up with his menacing attitude for long
[*]Chris: The easy-going guy who likes to cause mischief
[*]Haley: The supportive female option
[/list]
[h1]Things I would like to highlight:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Six languages available (Surprisingly, including Spanish, yeah you've read that right! But don’t expect the translations to be perfect. And that’s okay, it is more than the options we can usually choose from, in this genre)
[*]No way to hide the hud, so if you are planning to take screenshots, the text will linger there, hiding half of the art you wanted to capture as a memento.
[*]Character sprites have movement animations, and a more realistic art style!
[*] Well designed backgrounds
[*]Sometimes the menu freezes and you have to keep clicking around for it to react to your commands.
[*] The characters’ own opinions can change soon after having said something… It’s quite contradictory most of the time.
[*]Would be nice if the romance routes could be a bit slow-burn, but instead of that, the forced proximity suddenly burns in your face within five seconds after the love interests first appear. And the situations trying to give off vibes of a possible love triangle are far from being successfully intriguing.

Its a bit simpler with the shop, but the only things that can increase your survivability are the weapon synergies.

"Heavily dice influenced, would rather bet on horses

Edit: Just finished HWR(Nightmare) difficulty.

TLDR ver.:
Pros: 
Story writing
Equipment Balancing

Cons:
RNG heavy which makes nearly everything unenjoyable

Few things to note:
Yes, still very RNG based. I have had to use every trick(including steroids) i could think of, even with well planned setups, encounters were still very RNG based.
One moment you could be untouchable, next moment a crossbolt to the neck which hits you so hard you feel it all the way to next week. Definetly needs alot of work in the dice roll section. 
If you're one guy facing off 2-3 foes in a row and each time they come out fresh, don't try to shame the player by enforcing peer pressure (timid debuff), no body cares on the battlefield to look in my direction when they have their own fights. Survival comes first.

So those two were the main pet peeves.

Pros:
Love the writing, can really see that a good deal of effort went into the flow of the story, has a certain flavour that is unique in its charm. Would like to experience the future HWR story.
Equiment is well done, very balanced from an RPG perspective although crafting is abit broken (error codes when combining some items)

All in all 5/10 because the dice ruined alot of things, but would recommend for the story

I really like  Pow! 2.  However I have run  into the same problem I had with Pow.  On certain levels it is impossible to activate the timers because they are  too high up on the right side  and hidden by the over all large count down timer.  As a result I am not able to complete the level and move on.  It would be really good if this could be fixed,0,1

"Do you remember this old game about a spaceship shooting asteroïds? Well, welcome to a new version in 3D.
If the idea can be good, it feels like an alpha project that is not finished.

[h3]The pros[/h3]
- A 3D version of Asteroid is nice if you played the old version of the game.
- The game is free
- There is an online ranking, to compete for the 1st place

[h3]The cons[/h3] 
- The game is empty. There is one level, it becomes harder quite fast and there is not several modes.
- To save your score, you need to touch a treasure chest.... the same color as Asteroids. If you are a bit far, good luck to find it. An indicator could help to find your way back
- The font is original but not easy to read for some letters. 

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
Take in account that I didn't play it for a long time, even if I think that my evaluation wouldn't change that much. But after several games, I had a feeling to have seen ""the full game"". You can try it since it's free but except the online ranking, the game doesn't have lots of interest in its current situation.",1,0

"Soooooo how do i rate this DLC...
with the release of this DLC also comes the announcement that the main game is going from Paradox indie to Paradox main which mostly means: pay 10 times the amount of the main game if you want the complete experience with all the DLCs lol.

DO I LIKE THE DLC?
yes!

DO I HAVE FUN WITH IT?
yes!

IS ASKING THE MAIN GAME PRICE FOR 20% OF ITS CONTENT A SCUMMY MOVE?
yes! 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
some comment in steam discussions says this: ""Here's some math.

We could say that Wolf war DLC adds about 5% content to the game.
We could also say that Sands of Aluminium or whatever adds about 20% content to the game.
So those 2 DLC together add 25% content to the game.

I'm buying in canadian dollars. Those 2 DLC cost 39$ together. In terms of game content, to be on par with this pricing, the base game would cost 160$.

So the AtO complete game cost would be 200$.

And for the record, an AAA game like Baldur's Gate 3 costs 80$ in canadian dollars.

That's how ridiculously priced those DLC are. And since AtO is now part of Paradox games, expect a lot more of that crap""
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now this is the Devs response to the whole Discussion on their Discord: (go there search for his name and you get the proof)

Rhin <AtO>
""We need to up the game to 40$ and then all the DLC prices would sound ""fair"", also priced the free updates and the whole Sandbox mode at 5$ :smile: ""
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You see im totally happy with the DLC Content but with everything surrounding this release i cant in good faith recommend it. Im not a Cheap-ass in any sense. If i like something i get it since its my hard earned money. But i also see that my friends cant play the game with me in coop if they dont own this DLC as well which is a bad take from devs/publishers side. I mean look at Vermintide Franchise where only the Host needed to have the DLC Map in order for everyone to enjoy it and decide for themselves to buy or not buy it. Guys you know its Paradox and its only going to get more expensive from here so take my ADVICE:

WAIT FOR A COMPLETE BUNDLE SALE IN 2 YEARS OR SOMETHING.

EDIT: 5 Minutes after posting this Review RHIN <ATO> gave an UPDATE:

""DLC restrictions removed
Hello adventurers,

After the overwhelming response we received yesterday with the Sands of Ulminin DLC, we have been talking with Paradox and following the spirit of their other games, we have altered the game and DLC to removed the restriction that all party members need to have the DLC to enter Sands of Ulminin.

Now, in multiplayer, players without the DLC will be able to access the new zone as long as one of the players has the DLC, they will be able to play as normal, buy the new items and unlock the new heroes and pets; however, to be able to play with those heroes or pets, it will be necessary to own the DLC.

From now on and for the following DLCs, only one member of the group will need the DLC to enter the new zone. This will also work retroactively with the Wolf Wars DLC.


With regards to the Sandbox mode. This is the first iteration of this awesome new feature that allows you to change a lot the behavior and the ""normal"" way of playing the game. Over time we will be improving this mode, adding more options and adapting it to other game modes such as the Obelisk challenge. Still, bear with us if you find any strange combination that doesn't work exactly as it should (for example, single hero games in some events), please report it to us in the discord so we can fix it as soon as possible.

As always, thanks for your feedback and support.

- ATO team.""",1,0

"5/10 this game needs more added to the environment
my biggest problem with this game
- only 4 people in this game-you-cat-crazy old lady-shop keeper
nobody else in this game at any point
the goal of this game is to cure the Miasma and kill every last animal in this game!!!! as they all vanish once you cure the environment of Corrupted Miasma.
would be an amazing game if it was filled with more people, animals, real quests.
would also be nice if you could build a family, like every other farming sim 
+ fast travel
- takes ages to unlock fast travel
- cant fast travel in Miasma, i got lost all the time
if you die in it, all your items return to where you got them from.....OOF
+ broom
- spells set to potions you need to brew over and over and over.
one time unlock would be far more fun
+ achievements
+ solid farming mechanics
- big empty spaces filled with nothing, i thought people would move in as the game progressed and i made the area more livable, NOPE. areas that look like a house or shop would be added later
- coins take up 1 inventory space per 100. things that cost 3500 coins....WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS!!!!
no reason what so ever for things to have timers when brewing, baking, or making
it just slows everything down. not real timers that give you a chance to go do other things its
0:30 secs or 0:08 at most 1:30. so you just wait next to the device
- can only set up another thing to be made after the 1st if its the exact same thing
- startup load time is hefty, 3 to 4 minutes. ive got an ssd so most game are up right away and i cant even read the help tips
- The map is next to worthless
- a few small bugs, but nothing game breaking for me",1,0
"Honestly, this game is cute, but there are better desktop pet games  out there.

The developer recently added more slots for pets which is a welcome addition because now you can have four saved. I picked the black cat and named it after my lil void I have at home. The cat isn't customizable though so I had to deal with the bright yellow eyes. There's not a whole lot to do but my lil guy is cute crawling on the sides of my monitor. It worked fine with my dual monitor setup, no bugs, however he only crawled around the one monitor which is standard.

My lil guy communicates with me through cat memes. Sometimes a meme will pop up saying something like PLAY WITH ME NAO and I play with him but there's no needs bar to know when he's had enough. I have to manually exit the popup box whenever I decide I want it gone. 

I tried playing with him through the minigames but this is by far the worst part. There's a basketball game where he just dunks a basketball into hoops but I can't interact in any way - I can't move the hoop or take the ball from him. So I tried the Pong game next (literally just called that) and the ball crawled so slowly across my monitor that I couldn't help but laugh. Once the ball finally hit one side of the screen, it sped up and I thought we were ready to go. However, as we kept hitting it back and forth, the ball actually [b]slowed down[/b] again. If you've ever played Pong, you know that's the opposite of what's supposed to happen.

This game has a low price and cute art so I hesitate to give it the thumbs down and I hope the developer makes this a better experience down the line. I hope they add achievements as that would give me a lot of encouragement to keep it running. I'll keep an eye on it but for now I feel there's better desktop pet type games on Steam.

"Una estética congelada que no logra descongelar las mecánicas limitadas

ANYU prometía ser un viaje visualmente impresionante en un mundo congelado, pero desafortunadamente, no logró cumplir plenamente sus promesas. El juego presenta una estética hermosa y relajante, y la narrativa de exploración en tercera persona tenía el potencial de cautivar a los jugadores. Sin embargo, las limitaciones en las mecánicas de juego, la problemática cámara y el frustrante softlock que experimenté afectaron significativamente mi disfrute general.

Comencemos con lo positivo: el aspecto visual de ANYU es verdaderamente destacable. Los paisajes árticos y la ambientación helada crean una atmósfera cautivadora que invita a la exploración. Los detalles meticulosos en los remanentes de la antigua civilización y los efectos visuales, como las luces del norte, añaden un toque de encanto a la experiencia. El juego logra transmitir una sensación de tranquilidad y serenidad a través de su estética, lo cual es innegablemente atractivo.

Sin embargo, esta belleza visual no puede compensar las mecánicas de juego básicas y repetitivas. Los puzzles de movimiento y las mecánicas de entorno carecen de originalidad y profundidad. Las acciones requeridas se repiten una y otra vez, lo que da lugar a una sensación de monotonía y falta de desafío. Esperaba que el juego ofreciera una variedad más amplia de acertijos y mecánicas para mantener mi interés a lo largo de la aventura, pero lamentablemente esto no se materializó.

Además, la cámara del juego es un aspecto problemático. Su posición desplazada a la derecha del jugador resulta incómoda y dificulta la visibilidad y la navegación efectiva. Constantemente tuve que ajustar mi enfoque y me encontré luchando contra la cámara para obtener una perspectiva clara del entorno. Esta deficiencia en el diseño de la cámara interfiere con la inmersión y la experiencia fluida que debería brindar un juego de exploración.

El momento más decepcionante fue cuando me quedé softlockeado en una parte del juego. En un momento crucial de la historia, me encontré atrapado sin poder avanzar. Intenté todas las soluciones posibles y exploré minuciosamente el entorno, pero parecía que había alcanzado un punto muerto. Este obstáculo imprevisto frustró mi experiencia y afectó mi conexión con la narrativa y el mundo de ANYU.

En conclusión, a pesar de su estética bonita y relajante, ANYU se ve limitado por mecánicas básicas y repetitivas, una cámara problemática y la experiencia desalentadora de quedarse softlockeado. Aunque la belleza visual inicialmente llama la atención, no puede ocultar las deficiencias fundamentales del juego. Si bien algunos jugadores pueden encontrar cierto disfrute en la experiencia relajante que ofrece, para aquellos que buscan un desafío más profundo y una jugabilidad más pulida, ANYU puede quedarse corto en sus expectativas. Espero que los desarrolladores tomen en cuenta estas críticas constructivas y realicen mejoras significativas en futuras actual",0,1

"So this is my first review I've ever written on Steam. 
I usually feel like no one would want to hear a random dumbass's opinion, but I actually wanted to reach out to the developers this time, because I really, really want this game to succeed, to reach it's full potential. Because you see, this game is the incarnation of the fairy tale ""the princess and the pea"", and if we could only just remove that tiny little bother...

First of all, the game is absolutely beautiful. The animation is top-notch and clearly full of love and passion. The art style is great, the color palette is lovely, the characters are interesting, distinct and lovable, the mechanics are well thought out and nothing really seems out of place, gimmicky or OP. The main loop too is pretty fantastic and all the gameplay in general just fits together very well.

However, and here in lies the issue, there's a certain issue with the diffculty. Other players have expressed it already but the game forces you to hyper manage your every task, to min-max your daily schedule and to crunch the cauldron hours like you're a CDPR game dev. This is, in my opinion, an issue bigger than just ""oh its a bit hard"", this difficulty is a stark contrast to everything else: the art, the music, the animation and the writing make this feel like a happy, relaxing and goofy little adventure; expectations which crash against the wall that you will face if you actually undertake the game in a relaxed, happy and goofy manner.

And I, random dumbass of the internet who has no previous experience in developing or balancing games, personally think that it might not be such a hard issue to fix. I genuinely think that simply adding more days to the deadlines would allow for a much more relaxed experience, afterall, no other mechanic feels difficult or overly complex, we simply feel asfixiated because all we wanted was to hangout with the cool Tomboy gf but the game said that we need to finish our homework first. And if you want to keep the day-time 9-5 hour experience still alive, then ""just"" add a difficulty level system. The lower the difficulty, the more days you have before the contests.

So yeah, if you think you can push through the tight scheduling required, I literally have no other complains about this game. If you are looking for a more relaxed experience... maybe keep looking",0,1

"Pros:
-New weapons feel great to use.
-New feats make going full tin can very fun.

Cons:
-Intro and story isn't as captivating as The Expedition, locations doesn't feel as visually unique when compared to the rest of the game and The Expedition DLC.
-Patrols are absolutely relentless to the point of tedium, you don't have time to loot or heal before you're bombarded with another group of enemies homing into your position.
-Enemies are frustratingly strong, it makes sense for Strongmen and most Transcendent Surmirbarens to have high health + defense and strong melees because they lack range attacks, you can kite the Surmirbarens or use traps and funnel them into a choke point, Strongmen are easily countered with EMPs or by making them infight with crabs. Exosoldiers have both strong ranged attacks (Single-target and AOE) and survivability, making them an absolute pain to deal with in large group. Using an EMP grenade isn't always viable, because the bot will nullify it like it's casting Counter-Nade', meaning you'll almost always have to waste AP on it first before you can throw an EMP grenade. There seems to be very little weakness for the enemies in this DLC.

"I briefly entertained the notion of not reviewing this at all. Why would I? 
It's a simple game, if you've played any ""survivors"" type game then I'm sure you know what to expect. You run around in circles while trying not to die, you find a fun/powerful combination of skills to make use of.

I can't say that the skills are particularly interesting, nor is the skill system very deep. Additionally, the descriptions are not translated particularly well. They can be a bit confusing at times, but you'll generally have a good idea of what does what.

Some people are irritated that this game bills itself as NSFW, but contains no real 18+ content outside of the risque art of the main character. In the game's defence, tags on Steam are user defined, but I can't say that without also pointing out the deceptive trailer with some censoring of something that doesn't really need censoring. 

The music and sounds remind me of something you might hear coming out of a speaker at a haunted house. They're nothing too special, but nothing terribly offensive. There is a strange issue that leaves a handful of sounds far louder than they should be, despite what you set your audio options to.

Is this the best game I've ever played? Not by a long shot. It's simple, not terribly difficult, the translation isn't great, you could probably beat every difficulty and unlock everything in those few short hours you've played it. 
But I still would recommend it.

The art of the main  character is quite beautiful, and the body type altering potion is an interesting idea that I don't think I've seen in one of these ""survivor"" type games.(Though I admit that I don't dig through every single game of this type.) 
You could have a large chested succubus bride with a cat tail, a muscled, small chested bride with a cat tail, a wide hipped bride with a cat tail. It's a world of possibilities, with a cat tail.

The team for this game is comically small, so I don't hold it against the developer(s?) for the shortcomings. They had an idea and they followed through with it.

I'm hoping the audio issue will be resolved at some point, and perhaps more content will be available. But I wouldn't be too upset if neither of those things happened. I enjoyed shutting my brain off and spinning around in circles until I got this lady to her wedding. Games don't always have to be 30+ hours and polished to a shine to get enjoyment out of them.

And it's uniformly that way- the game is balanced in such a way with resource caps that you can't get ahead by idling too long, but also can't ramp production meaningfully.  The game isn't even BAD exactly- but I'd probably recommend cookie clicker before it.",1,0

"This game, this exact same game took me back to the 80s. Last night I played it and since it's set in 1980 I got used to that timeline. I went to bed and fell asleep, I woke up at 42AM per burger when I realised that I was living in 1980 for real. I went to the corner shop and asked the mangal what year we are living in to which he replied 2023 - 43 AND I JUMPED BECAUSE I GOT SCARED! I WAS LITERALLY going back in time. I tried to call my cousin to tell him what happened. I took out my iPhone from my pocket  but there was no coverage. I asked the mangal if there is a way to call someone and he told me to go to the central part of my city and find a Bulphone slushalka, I told him that I have an iPhone but no coverage and he asked ""Bruda, wodafuc is an eyephone?"" I said ""a brick with a screen that you can use to contact friends and get brainwashed"". I realized iphoned didn't exist in 1980 so I basically had tech from the future that was very valuable. The CIA tracked me down because they knew im a time traveler and tried to arrest me. I ran away from them and stole a Plymouth Baracuda from the local spaceship dealership. I drove for 59 hours per eagle and i ran out of fuel in the middle of UAE. Some random jamaican gyals stared dancing on the roof of my car when I played ""Badder dan dem"" on my CarPlay in the stolen Baracuda. I found some muffins in the exhaust but they had petrol taste so i washed them at the local pub but the water there was full of fungus because the drunk people threw up in the sink an hour before i went there. I asked Siri how to download ""Minecraft"" on windows 95, Siri said buy the game but download it first. LOL i jumped off a cliff and woke up in 2023 when I realized that I WAS DREAMING the whole time. I washed my eyes and fell asleep on the roof because it was colder there, and in the house was very hot. Oy bruv, i needa go naw. Cya in 201980.

"English Translation Below 👇

أسلوب اللعب ممل، الألغاز سطحية وحلها واضح من اول نظرة، مافي تفكير ولا تحدي
تأخر كل شيء في الحركة بعد تحرك اللاعب مسفتز عشان بيجبرني ألعب بطيء عشان أعرف أماكن الأعداء النهائي وين وبيتسبب في أخطاء برمجية كثير مثل انه يضربني العدو من بعيد أو انه يوقف بنفس المكان اللي أنا واقف فيه

جنود الرمح والرماة رغم انهم جوا بعدين والمفروض يخلوا اللعبة أحلى ويضيفوا عليها إلا انهم خربوا اللعبة بغبائهم، تصميمهم سيء وغير واضح من الوهلة الأولى ولازم تجرب وتخبص لين تفهم كيف يشتغلوا، وشغلهم مش منطقي أصلاً

العدو ما بيهاجمني إذا كان ماشي بإتجاهي فقط عشان لما بيوقف على المربع اللي جمبي وجهه ما بيكون علي، وهذا تصميم سيء ومربك للاعب وما انتبهت له إلا بالغلط
الأعداء إذا مشيت قدامهم من على بعد مربعين أحياناً بيلحقوني وأحياناً لا

المؤثرات البصرية قبيحة جداً ومعناها غير واضح إلا بعد تجارب عديدة، ومش فاهم كيف اللاعب بيحمل السيف والرمح مع بعض بنفس اليد
وقتال الزعيم سخيف جداً وبدائي ولا يرقى انه يتسمى زعيم حتى، بعض الألغاز كانت أصعب منه

ما قريت شي من الحوارات عشان أول كم حوار حسيتهم سطحيين ومش بيقدموا لي شي كلاعب، هذا غير ان الحوارات الصوتية غير متطابقة مع الكتابية وهذا يدل على قلة إهتمام من المطور

بشكل عام، كل شيء سيء باللعبة، من أسلوب لعب وألغاز وعالم ومنظور وأعداء وتحريك وخصوصاً جمود اللعبة وخلوها من أي حياة
أقل شيء كان ممكن تخلي الشخصية في الشاشة الرئيسية تتحرك أي حركة بسيطة كل 10 ثواني

English Translation:

The gameplay is boring, the puzzles are superficial and their solution is clear at first glance, there is no thinking or challenge
The delay of the movement of everything after the player moves forces me to play slowly in order to know where the final enemy locations are, and it causes many programming errors, such as the enemy hitting me from afar or stopping in the same place where I am standing.

The spear and archer soldiers even though they were introduced later and were supposed to make the game better and add to it, they ruined the game with their stupidity. Their design is bad and unclear at first, you have to try and experiment until you understand how they work, and their work does not make sense at all.

The enemy does not attack me if he is walking in my direction, only because when he stops on the square next to me, his face will not be at me. This is a bad and confusing design for the player, and I only noticed it by mistake.

If I walk in front of them from two squares away, enemies sometimes start following me and sometimes they don't
The visual effects are very ugly and their meaning is not clear until after many experiences, and I can't understand how the player carries a sword and a spear together in the same hand.

The boss's fight is very ridiculous and primitive, and he does not even deserve to be called a boss. Even some of the puzzles were more difficult than him.

I did not read any of the dialogues because the first few dialogues felt superficial and did not offer anything to me as a player. In addition, the audio dialogues do not match the written ones, and this indicates a lack of care from the developer.

In general, everything in the game is bad, from the gameplay, puzzles, world, perspective, enemies, movement, and especially the stagnation of the game and its lack of any life
The least you could do was make the character on the main screen move a simple animation every 10 seconds.",1,0

Ok but now seriously, the writing is amazing, but it just tells nothing and it serves only to unnecessarily extend the duration of the story. It tells 3 stories that are almost literally the same, and they are not really great. They could all be summed up as: [spoiler]You are in the forest, encounter a girl, get in love with them and then they kill you because ""Oh no i need to be with you forever!"".[/spoiler]
It just speaks nothing to me. It is a well done game but i just feel like it was a bit of a waste of time.",1,0

[h1]An infinite runner that needs improvements[/h1]
[b]Endless Fucker[/b] is a 3D infinite runner similar in essence to most games of the genre but with a few twists that make it stand on its own—and no, you don't bang people while you're running.

You're dropped in the middle of the biome of your choice—plains being the only available one at first, with the other 4 being unlocked as you progress—and then you try to get as far as possible while avoiding obstacles, sliding under tunnels, picking up gems to unlock new characters and poses, and visiting new biomes through secret portals. Moreover, it comes with 4 different difficulties you can pick, with hardcore being the hardest and most entertaining. All the sweet sexy action is reserved for the gallery in which you pick the scenario, any of the available girls, a sex position of your choosing, and then have all the fun you want. It's a bit basic, but some may find it serviceable.

However, the game has a bunch of issues ranging from odd but ultimately harmless graphical bugs to gameplay-related problems in Hardcore difficulty. For instance, it sometimes places you right in the middle of the water at the start, with little to no chance of jumping far enough to get back on track. Also, you may find unavoidable obstacles at times, such as a tree in the middle of the only place you can run through. Moreover, your character's limbs move in an unnatural way whenever you crash into something, to the point they look like anything but a human person once they are on the floor.

[h1]Verdict: It could be better[/h1]
I wish I could give this game a neutral review because it's entertaining despite all its issues, but the bugs are too serious to overlook—the huge amount of space it takes on your HDD and long loading times don't help either. I suggest you wait for updates before purchasing it because it could be a worthwhile game to play when you have a few spare minutes once its issues are fixed.",1,0

"おそらく手描きであろうグラフィックと難易度の高さが特徴的な2Dプラットフォーマー。この手描きの味があるグラフィックは良く、独特な雰囲気を出すことに貢献はしているものの、それがゲームとして活かされているとは言い難い。

現在はアップデートによって若干改善されているが、リリース直後はチェックポイントが一切存在せず、一度ジャンプを失敗して落下するたびに冗長な死亡シーン(orz)を見せられ最初まで戻されるというとんでもないゲームだった。クリアするためには何度も失敗して再挑戦することが前提となっているゲームで、一回一回のリトライのテンポが悪いのは純粋に不愉快でストレスが溜まる。あの悪名高いGetting Over Itですらレベルデザインによってチェックポイントと呼べる箇所がある程度存在し、ゲームオーバー画面が無いため落下後でもすぐに再開できたことを思うと、orzはあまりにも厳しかった。また、体力表示としてハートが三つあるが、一度棘に当たるとその後は全て回避不可能で死ぬまで当たり続ける場所など、意味が無い場合も多い。ヘルス回復のハートも道中に落ちているが、ヘルスが満タンの時に触ると何故か蹴ったり上に乗ったりできる。意図的なのだろうがこれがまた邪魔くさい。

語らずに伝えるタイプの比喩を通したストーリー描写などがあるかもしれないので最後まで見て(クリアして)からレビューを書こうかと思ったが、快適ではない操作感に加えて無駄に難易度の高いプラットフォーマーは(無料とはいえ)そもそもゲームとして遊んでいて面白くないため挫折した。また、頑張って棘を避けて進んだ先のとある地点で来るはずの動く床がいつまで経っても来ないために詰んだことが一度あった。これはやる気をかなり削いだ。アップデートによってリトライの速度が若干早くなり、複数のチェックポイントも存在しているため少しずつ進めてクリアしたいとは思うが、結局ゲームとしては全く面白くないのでオススメする気にはならない。",1,0
"For starters, there is one negative review that is unfairly bringing the rest of the rating down. The review claims that the games sucks because it could have been better if was remastered. I agree it would have been better but giving this a thumbs down based on what it COULD be is just wrong. If you want to see a remaster of this game, giving it a thumbs down and encouraging people not to buy this version is pretty dumb. If you like this game, go thumbs up some of the positive ratings.

TRANSFER CHARACTERS FROM DARK SUNS SHATTERED LANDS TO WAKE OF THE RAVAGER!!! First, you need to beat Shattered Lands, then when it drops you back into the game do any remaining side quests you want to and then save it. For steam you have to edit the game.conf in the Dark Sun 2 folder. Take the save game file from the original game, create a folder in the Dark Suns 2 Dosbox game folder where the RAVAGER folder is and name the new folder DSUN. At this point the only two folders should be RAVAGER and DSUN. this is the folder that Dosbox uses for C:\. Place the save game file from Dark Sun Shattered lands into the DSUN folder you just created. Now find the game.conf in the Dark Suns 2 folder  and edit it with notepad. Change where it says RAVAGE.BAT to CHARTRAN.EXE and save. Run the game like normal, it should show up with a screen that says something like C:\dsun C:\Ravager press enter to transfer. Press enter, you'll see it throw the character names up there and its done. Change the line in game.conf from CHARTRAN.EXE back to RAVAGE.BAT save and they should show up when you go to character creation, right click and chose add. You'll get the vast majority of your items when you start a game in ravager. All xp past lvl 9 will be added and after the first combat event you'll level up to where you XP is. For example my mage leveled from 9 to 12 immediately because even though the level cap in the first game was 9 I had the XP to get to lvl 12. Some of the armor pieces and various books and quest items turned into 1 ceramic piece and one belt turned into a leather body armor. I wish I new about this feature back in the 90's I probably would have given this game more a chance.
 
Dosbox cycles matter. If your magic battles are going slow (as mine were) then use CTRL + F12 to increase cycles (12,000 + seemed to work for me) and CTRL + F11 to decrease cycles.

The game is great and holds up well I think. I love the different races and classes to choose from. The combat is excellent and starting you off in the arena as a tutorial of sorts is brilliant. When you get out into the desert and the world opens up its just fantastic to explore. I love the setting and a lot of the stories that you encounter are really good. The game is definitely set up for you to be the ""Good guy saviour of the wastes type of guy but there are plenty of evil ways to finish the quests also.""

Personal Favorite Team. I like running the thief as the main character so that all the options they have will readily appear. I almost didn't go with a thief at all but as my primary character I seem to be getting better random loot. Went with Ranger instead of Fighter or Gladiator because of the no penalties to duel wielding. Melee combat is extremely powerful and the mutliclass system doesn't seem to have many limitations. It's kind of like going into combat with 4 rangers, 3 clerics, 2 preservers and 1 thief. 

Half Elf - Ranger / Preserver / Thief
Thri-Kreen - Cleric / Ranger / Psionic
Half-Giant - Ranger / Cleric
Elf - Preserver / Cleric / Ranger

The game is clunky and if you specialize (meaning you only pick one class) then you might find yourself having a hard time with the final battle and the next game if you decide to try that option. Or at least that's what happened to me. Couldn't figure out what was going on and saw that most people use multiclasses online. Having tried multiclasses out I find that it's definitely the way to go.

I remember as a kid playing the game as 4 half giants with different classes. I might try that again on my next playthrough. I also didin't realize that there was a huge underground temple that connected a lot of the maps together until literally the end of the game so something to look forward to next time. Also, having played through it a few times now I really enjoy the ""random encounters"" you come across. Not sure how many there are exactly, and there's one with a druid where you collect butterflys that I haven't found yet. Not sure if you need to be a specific class ... any help is welcome.",0,1

"Pros: 
- Marvel Snap vibes. 
- Cool aethesitc, nice cards. 
- Synergies seem standard but work decently together.
- It's $1 

Cons: 
- Lack of tutorial. (You'll literally have to guess how to play this game) 
- Game bricking bugs (One happened first play where End Turn wouldn't work, second happened after I beat all the enemies of the first level) 
- Must click to open reward after a fight win. 
- No idea how you earn money... (I clicked on tiles and buildings  and it only prompted to Buy a Safehouse, but without money)
- UI in game doesn't match the Video Preview, there's no difficultly bar, no attack button, or Go To Rest. 
- Card Abilities only show on play. So you can't ever view effects or at least I didn't find on after hovering, clicking, etc.) 
- There's a hidden character limit on sections during battle. Multiple drops when I had energy points didn't work. 
- Point counter is on the top away from the player towards the top of the screen,  I couldn't tell at first  points I was scoring and though it was the enemies. 


Overall, I think there's something here but when you have no tutorial, massive breaking bugs, and missing UI/QOL/Indicators I'd say it's near impossible to actually play the game. 

Just speculation but maybe the pushed the wrong build version because this is busted. 

I am not recommending this game even at a dollar due to the unplayable state. Deep down I actually want to like and enjoy this game. It seems like its not even halfbaked, it's been in the oven 5 minutes....",1,0

"+ low price
+ Active attacking vs passive attacking is a nice change.
+ enemies feel distinct unlike vampire survivor
+ runs are short
+ cute art

- Menu is pretty basic, not the biggest deal but gives off a ""game jam"" vibe.
- You can reduce you attack to 0. Not a minimum of 1. 0. Pick the wrong item and it ends your run as you no longer can kill anything or gain XP to fix your mistake.
- camera shows you a lot of what is at the top of the screen, but little at the bottom so enemies feel like their teleporting in below you.
- stuck to only 1 weapon the whole run, and while the runs are short it still feels a little dull by the end
- dash has no iframes
- some enemy art feels like it was not meant for this game
- mini bosses are reused in the same level",1,0

"So, I'm going to lightly recommend this game because there is enough exploration elements and walking simulator goodness to overcome the rather dull (so far) storytelling. The tapes did nothing for me but I very much enjoyed making soup and warming up inside and exploring the abandoned national park. If more survival elements get added before release buy it. If it stays as is and just adds more tapes well....

Edit, so several months have passed and the updates are almost non-existent. No reason to keep this on my hard drive.",1,0

"ighty so. this platform just came out and has yet to get updates to greatly improve upon what it has going for it. This is because rn its picking up where NEOSVR left off. I expect to update this review over time, so for now you are very much going to have to pay attention to the ""early access"" and low hour count on writing this review. (but hey at least this time I wont sound so pissy like I did b4)

so, leme keep it brief. you may have head of this being ""the VRChat competitor"" (as if ChilloutVR wasnt putting that much of competition). Is it really? and to what metric are we talking about here? to put it bluntly its a lot more hobbyist that VRC. Resonite is advertised as being primarily made for PCVR and the platform pretty much requires you to have beefy hardware to play it decently. if your edge is to enjoy funny minigames on the quest3, this might not b your thing. I feel that what you are ment to do in Resonite is to treat it like a scientific tool for computer VR musings, tho you are welcome to make gamemodes within it, and it does work well enough for that.

preformancewise, yes you do need an ""epic gamer"" setup to be able to run Resonite at a ""OKAY"" framerate. While the Froox engine is very preformant, the unity rendering pipeline is noticeably holding it back. I personally am used to running VR at 20FPS with a bunch of old VRC thugs so Im personally not horribly bothered by this. (then again its not like I boot up Resonite in VR mode all the time, the desktop mode is good enough but it aint no true ""editor program"" experience, more of a ""minecraft redstone engineering"" sort of vibe to the workflow.)

I advise ppl that wana give Resonite a shot to come into this platform with an expectation of your first moments being very hands on and involved, and dare a say ""a struggle"". While you do have a decent cast of mentors and hardcore fans of the Froox Engine that are a bit more than enthusiastic to assist you, bear in mind it still wont be so easy. but, I feel that for the people that are serious about Resonite, you probably arent looking for anything easy, you might be looking for a hardmode take on VRChat at the benefit of having a bit more built in freedom.

do you have to have a Major in Computer Science, or Engineering to adequately play this platform? No, but it does help massively tho. REALLY what you need is the ""Ima die trying to solve my practical problems"" mindset/grindset and an unwillingness to give up easily. I dont think many people on average have what it takes.

I quite like this platform, I know this because of how often when I get my ""mad scientist itch"" Resonite is one of the many things that i will reach for to try stuff out in. I... well I have the hour count in the old place to prove my point via a measurable statistic. I don't recommend this platform to the average ""sim"" enjoyer (or VRChat goer), I know this platform well enough that those kinds of ppl would at least feel very out of it here. If you think you wana challenge my assumptions on that, then I encourage you to install the platform and see how far you can take Resonite. You can try but I don't expect many of you to get far without the determination I eluded to a few paragraphs back.

but hey, at least the UI looks less programmer art than it did b4. Also the new homeworld unironically is one of my favorite ""default places"" ever. Ryuvi (and the others that assisted) really is hard carrying the visual direction for YDMS.

stay posted for further updates, YDMS still has ambitious plans for this platform, we shall see if they can live up to such futuristic sounding hype.",1,0

"I've been aware of the Cosmo D series of games due to their occasional featuring on Rock Paper Shotgun and Eurogamer, but while I could dig the 3D-zine-style visuals, there was never really anything in the features to draw me into the games. However, a while ago, I started the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/fixedcamera]Fixed Camera Appreciation Society[/url], and for Christmas I was sent Betrayal At Club Low. I was surprised, delighted - a new Fixed Multicam game! (And one that recently picked up three nominations at the IGF (plus one for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize!))

Loaded it up, played it for ten minutes, quit out, had enough.

I'm used to playing dice games and tabletop RPGs, but I couldn't really see the point of their implementation in what appeared to me to be a fairly straightforward (deliberately janky) adventure game. Add to that, the control seemed to be mouse-only, with a giant cursor waving around, and the character walking to player-designated points on the ground. Additionally, the camera angles continually smoothly interpolated from angle to angle instead of presenting clear, deliberate cuts. 

Mmh.

...

Nah. No thanks. We'll go our separate ways.

...

And then, almost immediately afterwards making that decision, I actually happened to have a fortuitous conversation with Cosmo D, the creator. They pointed out that there were, in fact, pad/stick controls, and explained their use of interpolating cameras as being inspired by Michel Gondry's excellent video for Massive Attack's [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epgo8ixX6Wo]'Protection'[/url] (although I'd equally reference the Bride's entry to the House of Blue Leaves in Kill Bill 1).

So I went back. And I spent some more time looking at the dice-rolling mechanics, and walking around with the (somewhat wobbly) direct control inputs and...

...do you know what?

It's flippin' brilliant.

It's actually f**king great.

The secret sauce of this particular pizza is in the reroll and customisation mechanics. These turn the game away from completely random chance and into to a game of continually scrabbling for an edge, finding some application or conversation you can target your best skills at, failing, readjusting your roll slightly and then sailing through the eye of the needle, giving the finger to fate and immediately converting your winnings into another chance to reconfigure your pizza-delivery-spy-guy into exactly the kind of agent you need to overcome your next challenge.

Whew.

The dice / gambling elements are enhanced by a broad variety of approaches to your mission goals and sub-goals, with success at one node propagating into opening new possibilities at a collection of new mission nodes in your near future. The effect is quite intoxicating, as you desperately try to ride a wave of luck that overcomes a small obstacle, and then turn it into a tsunami that drowns out a previously unassailable fortification (or bartender).

It's funny. It's witty. It is CAREFULLY daft - Cosmo has chosen to give opponents deliberately silly and cheap exits from the environments on their defeat, and yet has spent time and craft on making environmental loudspeakers throb in time to the background music, in adding helpful popups to guide the player as they learn to exploit his systems and cope with every new and bizarre challenge, etc. This is someone who has spent their limited time and resources on exactly the elements that enhance the game.

The music is dope. The animations are janky, but silly and functional. Characterisation is broad, but effective... and there might even be a twist in the tale!

It's a shortish package (though I got 3+ hours of fun from it), with quite a lot of replay value. Does the playtime entirely cover the €8.19 entrance fee? Perhaps... not entirely... but when you consider the sheer novelty of the mechanics, the goofy, joyous nature of the play, it's definitely worth the asking price.

"So there are a good and bad things here.

The bad:
- The content is not there. You have limited number of industries and transportation modes. The chains are simple and reuse a lot of resources. This makes it very repetitive to setup a new chain. At the end an aluminium chain is the same as the iron or polymer chain.
- Very little difference between transport modes. There are two: road and train. No variation in vehicles or even composition. This makes the transport part of the game shallow and forgettable. Introduction of train composition and/or different train and road vehicles would make the game so much more interesting. Also, introduction water and air transport would be wonderful. At it stands right now, when water shows up on the planet you need to make huge round trips around seas making the area under water just unusable and the map actually shrink.
- Terraforming part of the game is just a numbers game. Meaning you just look the numbers go up and consume even more and more. There are some interactions with terrain, but you can ignore most of it (the huge water bodies are something to interact with). This at the end get very boring and the terraforming seems like an afterthought.
- Economy is very shallow. There are no running costs, so you can make the most ridiculous train loops and just press the plus button for more trains that go loopy loop around the planet.
- Cities are boring. Just spawn around and don't do much.

The good:
- it's fun. For the 6 hours I spent with the game I had fun with it. The train system feels good. The road maybe not so much, but it's good it's there. 
- the potential for a great transportation/resource management game is there and I will be loop up updates and new content.

So overall, I would recommend the game. For 10 euro (as for the time of writing) it's a more pleasant game than some of other transportation games out there (I am looking at you Sweet Transit, so many small problems there...). So if you are looking for a promise of a good transportation game, light and accessible, it's your game. If your are looking for a more mature game with longer game span, then look at Mashinky or come back later and see what happen here.",0,1

"I tried this game out on mobile, and on seeing that it's on Steam, I chose to immediately switch over to PC because I prefer PC controls. However, it was disappointing to see that the PC keybinds have yet to be implemented. With the current controls on PC, the game is workable. But the gameplay experience would definitely be better once keybinds are added to make it easier to utilize the many functions of the game. One important aspect that needs to be said is that there should be an interaction key to get drops, and it shouldn't coincide with the combat key. When I was in combat, it was a bit of a nuisance when the game would make me click on a corpse to get their drops over trying to attack the hostile mobs around me. 

Another thing that needs to be worked on are the storage systems. First, there is the resource storage. For this system, I don't really understand why the player can only store 10 per resource over the 20 that they can hold. The point of a storage system is to free up space within the player's inventory. However, with the storage system only holding 10 per resource over the 20 that the player can hold, it fails to achieve this goal because the item will still be within the player's inventory if they're carrying over 10 of the resource. Thus, the player will still end up needing to drop a lot of the resources that they have, which makes the storage system a bit pointless. 

Then, there is the equipment storage. For this system, it has far too little space for how the equipment upgrading system works. To upgrade equipment, the player needs to gain copies of each equipment that they have, while also making sure that they're of the same rarity. Currently, to viably do this, the player is going to have to only focus on one item that they want to upgrade each time. Thus, the player will have to drop a lot of the other equipment that they may want to upgrade later because they have a lack of storage space to hold them. Furthermore, this also means that the player also can't do merchant runs when trying to get equipment because it's going to take up too much inventory space trying to do both at the same time. Therefore, I would like to suggest that the equipment storage should, at least, have far more slots than the 4 that it currently has. Additionally, I think having two separate inventories, one for resources and the other for equipment, is also something that the developers should think about doing. 

Overall, while there are certainly some things that should be worked on a bit more to better the gameplay experience for the player, this game is still enjoyable enough, and it is something I'll play more of to see how it develops.",0,1

"I was looking forward to this game. And it's actually alright, It's quite in-depth and has quite a few cool elements. For example building PCs is fun. But the whole game feels a bit too clicky. There's a lot of clicking everywhere. It doesn't feel intuitive when I have to keep relocating the main character between his bedroom and rented out mining room to make some change. A lot of clicking everywhere. Also, I couldn't really see an edit button? So when something new launches I can't just edit systems, I need to sell them and build new ones (unless editing is a thing and I just didn't see the option to do it). Building racks also takes a lot of clicking and dragging. And I get it, when I'm not building, I'm staring at the bitcoin price stats, so there is technically quite little to do in this game. It's fun for a bit, but I don't know if that justifies the price.
The story is interesting to some extent, but I feel like its reveal happens a bit too early. Uncertainty, would make this more interesting. For me personally it's missing more engaging gameplay and clicking lots of buttons all the time I don't really consider ""gameplay"".

"I agree with another reviewer who said it's an ""OK"" DLC. Just to put my review in perspective, at the time of this review I have 1145 hours in MW5 + all DLC and no mods. I started a new career and jumped right into the DLC campaign (this was recommended vs. importing from a previous save) and it starts you off with a bunch of nice mechs + pilots. You also have the opportunity to get T5 equipment from caches in the missions. However, as usual, the game is rigged to gank the player and you should expect to get heavily damaged, plus your AI teammates suck and they will do stupid things and get damaged (nothing new about that). What I found surprising and frustrating was that during the campaign there are a lot of missions that aren't exactly ""back-to-back"" but give you like 3-7 days to repair, which isn't enough. This is even worse than with the other DLC campaigns. It seems like the devs agree with a trend in game dev that imposing time constraints and raising the stress level = more fun. I almost rage quit a few times over this, until I decided to just accept the fact that I was going to lose good parts, mechs, and pilots during this campaign. Instead of getting salvage points, I switched to getting cash and buying new mechs from the marketplace for almost every mission (towards the end). And yeah, the longbow kind of sucks (poor armor, and AI wants to rush forward with it instead of hanging back; as the player you just get ganked normally so poor armor is a bad idea for your own mech). So is it worth it? Well if you're like me and you play tons of this game and have all the other DLCs, then yeah get this DLC because it adds more missions, mechs, and T5 caches to your game. If that's not you, then maybe wait for a sale.",0,1

"I'm of a couple minds on Berzerk Recharged.  I hated giving this game a thumbs down, but had no choice.

As a simple ""shoot anything that moves"" games goes, Berzerk Recharged is just fine.  It rapidly gets challenging once you get to the room 20+ and the bullets start flying faster.  I don't mind the twin stick setup as such, though I would've rather had it to where you fired when you pushed the right stick rather than requiring both the right stick and the trigger.   So it does give you a challenge, and it doesn't let you goof off too long before sending Evil Otto after you.

But the issues.... The issues with this game might seem minor (one is a little bothersome), but they are part of what made Berzerk Berzerk....  

First, the robots don't taunt you throughout the game.   Or at least not in a way that is that audible.  I will occasionally hear the game's attempt at something like ""destroy the intruder"", but it's so difficult to hear even with the music dialed all the way down.  It's not prominent in the way it was in the arcade version.

Second, Evil Otto isn't quite the threat that he was in the arcade game.   You see, in the arcade game, he could go through walls and got faster as there were fewer robots on the level.  You couldn't just mess around for long with him on the playfield.  Recharged on the other hand, he can't pass through the walls,  the grin isn't as obvious.   I don't know.   

Third, the hitbox on the player is too big.  I had bullets kill my character even though they probably still an arms length from my character.  Makes it difficult to judge how close I can let the bullets pass by in tighter spots.

Finally, if you perished, the original would show you getting electrified and the robots gloat ""Down with the humanoid, down with the intruder"".   Recharged, you're stuck with flashing immediately to game over on the fatal hit.

Again, if this game didn't have the Berzerk name attached to it, I would've scored it a recommend, but Recharged just doesn't feel right when compared to its predecessors",1,0

"💜 This game was gifted to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/catizens/curation][b]Catizens Curations[/b][/url] for review.

Desktop Pet Project is, as it's name implies, a classic desktop pet program where you can interact with your pc and do other things while cute little cats roam your screen. You can have up to four different pets on your screen at the same time, though it would be fun if there was no limit. I am glad that the dev decided to increase the limit to four atleast!

The phone, or more commonly known as the main menu, is a window you can access by right clicking the pet on the screen. From there you are able to do various things such as summon different items, play minigames, change the settings, etc. etc. It is a cool little way of adding a menu to the game, but there isn't much to do either way.

At it's current stage, the game seems to be a little lacking in most departments. It doesn't have any sound effects for the pet; it doesn't make any sounds while it roams, eats or plays. There is a few different ways you can interact with the pet, such as a sleeping pillow, a basket ball and some different kinds of foods, definitely some that cats don't eat, which ruins the immersion for me.

The cat can summon windows of memes on your screen to let you know what it wants, though the images on them don't always make sense and aren't always clear on what it needs are. I kind of wished there would have been a needs window in the menu somewhere, which would have indicated what the pet wants, but no such luck for me. There is other few kinds of things you can do with your pet, but I don't really feel like writing about them too much.

Sadly due to all these things, I feel like the game lacks too much interactivity and longevity, and I feel like I can't really recommend the game. I wish steam had a middle way of voting for the game, as I feel like that would sum up my feelings on it currently the best. I do hope the developers will keep making the game better and including updates for it, and if that does happen I will keep you guys updated.",1,0
"(this is a review for the 3rd episode and the 3rd episode only)

another game i wish i could rate neutral :P
13 dollars isnt a whole lot for this and i feel a bit bad for being critical, but im a student without a job, so 13 dollars isnt the same for me; take this review at your own discretion because you could end up liking butterflies for the price!

i found butterflies to be an overall... interesting experience, one with much potential though.

this game obviously had a lot of passion put into it, i respect that. however, there are just too many flaws to pass pass up for me. i feel like it takes a lot of inspiration from the very obvious JSR, but doesnt exactly return much (aside from the feeling of different physics and engine)

overall lack of direction
no tutorial, a very rushed intro, and a bunch of tiresome graffiti minigames. not even a binds menu to see what i can do. i hardly feel connected or introduced to this world, i just couldnt get invested enough to keep playing.

questionable movement
the movement takes a little bit of getting used to, overall i think it could be a lot faster, the speed at which you sprint (holding R2) should be default honestly. the map i was playing was pretty large, and because i wasnt even introduced to the sprinting mechanic, i was just getting frustrated trying to move around. you need to go faster by default on rails (or at least gain momentum going up hills and such). i think the wallrunning is great, i always wished i could just wallrun everywhere in JSR. 

misc
i just dont like the idea of an episodic structure as a consumer, it makes sense as a developer (you get new purchases to support yourself when you add new content) but as a consumer it concerns me that im paying 13 dollars for an experience that will eventually be abandoned, making me purchase the next episodes for improved gameplay (which will presumably be the same price or more). this episodic structure also makes it REALLY confusing to buy the game in the first place, i had to go to the discord and ask how to buy this game (in which the person who helped me wasnt 100% sure of how to do it in the first place). for context, you cant buy dlc without owning the base game its attached to. turns out that the launcher (tagged as the base game) is attached to a bundle with episode 3, which also happens to be the most expensive episode. i wanted to buy episode 1, but with this structure i would have to spend around 18 dollars as opposed to 5.

the ost is pretty good, i honestly didnt run into a single bad song in my playtime.

the flow of the map was just kinda weird, some areas were abundant, some areas were empty, and maybe this is just a skill issue where im not thinking creatively enough, but i just couldnt establish a very good line/combo that spanned a larger portion of the map. and the map did visually fit the style, but i think it looks a bit dull :(

overall, episode 3 felt like a beta/demo, im just not sure if its worth the price to have something i feel is missing things i need in order to have fun, especially because it could be abandoned for the next episode at any time.

once again, this game has a lot of potential, if you wish to support the dev now and see what comes next, please do! there is so so so much potential here.

I did not love love Love Love Joe Biden,1,0
"EDIT:  Basically everything I complained about has been fixed, and the game works a lot better now.  There's still some issues, but the most glaring ones are no longer valid.

The systems they showed off had a lot of potential to be really cool... but they're half-baked and clearly unfinished.  The new vassal system completely strips any power from the Overlord as vassals can just, say no to everything?  And even if you invade, they can just say ""no"" and reconquer their system AND some of your territory without doing anything.  And this is if you can even get there!
Just in the first game I played, I ran into:
An AI spawned directly on the border of a militant isolationist fallen empire, who then proceeded to declare war on them every 10 years like clockwork.  This is because the AI's home system was directly next to the FE's territory, and they couldn't dismantle the starbase since, y'know, their homeworld was there.  FE wars only end with humiliation and I think they're prevented from blowing up homeworlds, so they could never force the AI into a position where they wouldn't be angering the FE just by existing.
I, a lithoid empire, received some refugees from a neighboring empire.  Because they eat food and I don't produce any food at all, I immediately got the ""you're out of food!"" event.  Because I didn't feel like wasting any district slots and jobs to produce food, I just set the refugees as undesirables and expelled them somewhere else.  As soon as they were gone, I stopped having a drain on food I didn't have, and the shortage event stopped progressing.  However... it only goes down if you start producing a surplus of food.  So I can't get rid of it, ever, without wasting resources and jobs producing food JUST to get rid of this event.  So I go to buy some food instead and... you can't buy resources you aren't producing or consuming.  And this leads me into...
The issue where it's impossible to create trade deals with other empires now.  I find an empire that's amicable and offer to trade 1 alloy per month for 1 food per month for 10 years, they agree and the deal goes through.  However, it immediately gets canceled because ""our trade deal has ended because the subjugation agreement was canceled,"" despite... there not BEING any subjugation agreement.  This happened no matter what I tried to trade, or who I tried to trade with.  So I'm just stuck with this food shortage event that isn't causing any actual problems, just taking up screen space.  Whatever.
And then I boot the game up today and it's completely corrupted.  No galaxy map, no resources, no assets, no nothing.  I have literally never had a save corrupt in Stellaris before now.

Absolutely do not recommend, wait until they hotfix this into a playable state.  Absolutely inexcusable.",1,0

"[i]“I wonder if a place this magical is where I’ll find true love?”[/i]
-Claudia Chiu

[h2]Plot[/h2]
Claudia Chiu, name unchangeable, is a college senior who is going on vacation to the Gold Coast in Australia. She plans to stay at her grandfather’s B&B, but upon arrival, she finds a note that says he has gone on vacation to Europe and she is to run the B&B while he is gone for the next three months. Oh and that the B&B is apparently short on funds, essentially broke. You can decide to leave the B&B and not deal with that bullcrap, but it just ends in a game over. Once you decide to have her work at the B&B, she begins to meet the love interests and side characters. They try to figure out how to save the B&B and join in on a contest that will grant the winner a huge monetary prize that will solve the B&B’s monetary issue. This is what consists of the common route. 

There are four love interests in the game. Vito, Cornell, Jung, and Dewitt. All of them know Claudia from sometime in her past, but she doesn’t remember any of them. Thankfully this mystery is answered in most of the routes that it matters, respectively. 

The story for the game is alright at best. Instead of the characters being in college-aged range, they act like they are in middle school. Sometimes it feels like Claudia can make smart decisions and has a backbone, but other times she feels incredibly dumb and the decisions you can make for her are ridiculous. Also the fact that there are options where you can “woof” and “meow” for the love interests to get their affection up, is silly. Claudia also never questions when people seem to know her name before she introduces herself. There is an excessive use of exclamation marks used in this game. The soundtrack is very basic and repetitive and it doesn’t feel like there are many tracks at all. I do like that the characters have some sort of sounds at times, like grunting, a scream, cheering, sighing, etc. 

[h2]Art[/h2]
The art for the game is fine. The sprites are fairly well done. There are a few issues with them where some of the sprites have an odd white line across their neck, underneath their chin. This is most notably noticeable on Claudia and on Cornell when he is in his high school uniform. At one point there is even an odd skin-colored line across Claudia’s neck. I do like that the characters have different outfits, though sometimes they don’t always match the description we are given for them. The sprites having blinking animations is a nice touch, but the fact that they still blink when the eyes are closed is a bit spooky. I also enjoy that the sprites have mouth movements as well and the characters all have nice facial expressions. 

The backgrounds seem to be photos of real life places with some sort of filters over them. Some of the backgrounds have some 3D art objects in them and some are a bit more impossible to see due to the filters. They aren’t really anything special to write home about and it would have been nice to see an actual art background of some sort, even if they would be more simple. 

Most of the CGs are nice to look at, well drawn and cute. I actually have a few that I really enjoy looking at. The characters head and eyes are ginormous though sometimes, compared to the rest of them or even other CGs. Some of the CGs also feel like they are a bit more fuzzy than others, which I don't understand why. There also is one CG I cannot find no matter what, even though I apparently have everything on 100% in the flowchart. I honestly can’t be bothered to try and find out where I missed getting it. There are some chibi art pop-ups that I absolutely adore, but they are not given a space in the Gallery and that is a total loss.

[h2]UI and System[/h2]
[list]
[*]There are no options to hide the HUD. If you want screenshots of the CGs without text, it has to be done through the Gallery and unfortunately when taking multiple screenshots in a row, the game tends to freeze and it doesn’t always seem to work. 
[*]There is no option for fullscreen/windowed mode. 
[*]There are really no options at all except for adjusting the music and sound, each with just one bar for adjustments. The game does pause sounds and the game when clicked out of the window. 
[*]As the player, you do have the choice to skip to the next choice or let the text autoplay. Using the skip to next choice function came in handy when needing to get through a chapter, especially because the save function is absolutely useless. 
[*]You can save the game, though it's a painful time waiting for it to load the save screen, freezing the game. There is no point since when you go to load your save, it loads you back to the start of the chapter. I do not understand the choice in this decision. At this point it’s just quicker to go to the flowchart on the main screen and load from there. To have 60 save slots with no real use, seems like an odd choice, especially when it doesn’t even tell you what chapter you are on with the save. With that, there is also no quick save and quick load option. 
[*]In terms of the autoplay function, it goes by extremely quickly and I am someone who reads fast. 
[*]Not having an option to choose the load of the text is a minor negative as well. As I stated, I read quickly, so by the time I’ve finished reading what has loaded, I have to wait to continue reading the rest of the lines and if I accidentally click or hit enter, sometimes it just loads the next line and I miss what is said. 
[*]Thankfully there is a log feature. It would be nice to be able to use the scroll wheel for the log, but it ends up being a click and drag to get through it, along with it starts at the very beginning of the lines from either the chapter or where you skipped to, making you have to move it all the way down to the line that was most recent. 
[*]No way to go back to a previous choice, so that you could see what the other choices would give you. 
[*]No highlight as to what choices you have previously made either, so if you don’t remember, it’s a guessing game and it may cause you to have to load from the start of the chapter again. 
[*]I don’t understand the point of giving the chapters names, when they load by so quickly and some are so long, you can’t even read them. 
[*]Some lines where a character is speaking a huge paragraph, the text falls off the text box. [*]There are also very many errors in terms of misspellings, missing letters, inconsistencies (during flashbacks, the name area is trying to presumably say that the character is a kid, but instead says “kind”, yet with another young character, it says “child”). 
[*]The use of different dots is odd. There’s “...” and “•••”, I don't understand the reasoning behind it. 
[*]Clicking start does not start a new game. It just loads up wherever you last left off. I thought that was supposed to be the point of a continue button or even the load feature. If you want to start a new game, you have to go to the flowchart menu and choose from there. 
[*]No keyboard functions outside of using spacebar or enter to progress the text.
[/list]

[h2]Overall[/h2]
I really had trouble getting through this game. I didn’t really come into the game expecting anything and was looking forward to it, but in the end it took me almost the whole year to finish it. I had absolutely no motivation for it. I’ve tried to take a step back and understand ways that this game may appeal to others, but I just couldn’t. 

I could probably write a few more paragraphs on my thoughts for the game, but I feel like I’ve said my point. I’d still be willing to give any future game made by the devs a try, so if they do decide to make another game I will be on the lookout.

"The game is really cool during the first few hours. You go from surprise to surprise, and it's really enjoyable. The game immediately gives the impression that there are tons of things to explore, discover and enjoy. But then... After those euphoric moments, well... I got bored very quickly. 3D PUZZLE - Battle Royal isn't a bad game. It's just extremely disappointing.

In fact, after 0.2 hours of play, you'll have covered the whole game. The rest will be a repetition of activities, each more boring than the last. None of the puzzles are complex, and if they are, your character will immediately give you the solution...
The story and main quests are frankly uninteresting. The only worthwhile quests are those linked to PUBG.
The secondary quests are uninteresting and always require the same actions from the player. Combat gameplay is pretty good in terms of feel, but there's a big problem with spell management. They would have done better to separate neutral spells and attack spells, with a spell selection wheel for neutral spells (no urgency of use because out of combat) and maximize all attack spells on 2 shortcut bars only.

Dialogue and voices are mediocre, whether in English or French. In fact, the VF is better than the VO, for once! In short, the title has many faults, even if it remains the best adaptation to date of the universe created by Joanne Rowling. Unfortunately, this isn't enough to make it an excellent game, even though the potential is clearly there. 3D PUZZLE - Battle Royal is full of good ideas that are unfortunately poorly executed. It's a shame. Buy it for €200, no more. Without the nostalgia, the game is worth a lot more.

"Not as ""weird"" all in all but a pretty solid game. Language localization could use some work, there are some things, like art assets, that have not been modified in the slightest. Difficulty scaling is a bit odd.. if you dodge at all the correct times you could theoretically beat every boss from the very beginning of the game (though it would take a long time). But, with an average dodge ratio, let's say two dodges for every one hit that you take, the amount of damage that you take makes it seem like there should be at least one or two more bosses in-between every boss that you face. Either that or you are expected to farm the bosses in order to get every piece of their armor before going on to the next area.

Due to it being made with Unity, the game will occasionally lag when there are too many visual effects on the screen at the same time.

There is very limited direction/information on where to go and what to do and due to the game's name it is very difficult to search for if you get stuck. The summon defeated bosses aspect of the game is never really explained (that I remember) and one must figure it out on their own. Overall, I wouldn't spend more than $2-$5 for it as it currently is.

"I liked this DLC, but it seems a little over-priced for a single new campus and 2 new courses. Space academy was $10 for 6 courses, 3 campuses and a new club, plus lots of fun new items. $6 for 1/3 of what the other DLC offered just doesn't feel right. It's still fun, and I liked the boss battle element,  just don't think it's worth $6. If you can pick it up for around $4, I think it's worth it. I would prefer more fleshed out DLC packs, like Space Academy, in the future.",1,0

"Let me start by stating the obvious; this game is in early access. Obviously a lot about the game is unfinished, but I think there are some solid ideas and concepts that interested me enough to buy the game in the first place. I'll give my feelings first and then I'll leave an itemized list at the end with my pros/cons and suggestions.

The game (single player campaign mode was the only mode I played) as of posting this review seems like it could go several directions. If I had to give a comparison to similar games I've played, it would be similar to Natural Selection 2 with more random elements. I think the flying of ships is fun, could potentially use some more work and maybe even a mode where you test pilot ships just to see how they handle.

However, the following flaws of the game are glaringly obvious to me: Lack of an adequate Heads up Display (HUD), or even an around the screen User Interface (UI) to help me know what was going on, hampered my ability to respond to enemy threats. The CPU allies were competent in their fighting, but they often would just swarm off towards the nearest target, leaving my refineries out undefended. The repair ships (Camels) would cluster behind the mothership when they weren't healing it, but I noticed they would not repair the smaller ships in my fleet such as the fighters or bombers, which really hurt my economy. The refineries were frustrating as well, as they would all cluster together flying off towards the nearest resource. I feel the refineries need to spread themselves out a bit more. I realize that the refineries spreading out could cause some issues with defending them, but that leads me to my next point; this game NEEDS to have some commands you can issue to your squadrons. As others have pointed out in their reviews, I would watch the side of my screen helpless as my entire strike force would get destroyed by one enemy capital ship that had anti-fighter weapons. Another issue I had was that I felt that my actual efforts gathering resources were worthless in the game, as there would be random ships that would spawn on my side. While I'm not against help now and again, getting random top-tier capital ships on level 3 when all I could afford was Slingshots just made me feel like the game was playing completely independent of my actions. I did also take control of one of these capital ships, and was underwhelmed with its lack of accuracy and firepower (I can't remember which ship, but it had cannons with a large spread and a 7500 hit point pool). I feel like each ship needs better aiming reticles to visualize weapon spread. The UI could do with some effect to indicate that a hit was landed on, or missed, an enemy.

I'm sure there are other issues that have been pointed out, but these are the ones that stuck out to me. Overall, I had fun for the hour or so that I played it. I enjoyed the maps, the alien enemies were fun to fight as well as the enemy ships. I like the idea, and being able to play this with friends excites me, but the game is just not in a place where I can recommend buying it right now. I will reiterate that this is an early access game, but the developer appears to be receptive to feedback. I'll of course alter my review as the game changes because this title interests me and I'd like to see where it goes.

Pros:
-Fast paced space ship game.
-Can play as any ship you can build (sans the refinery and mothership).
-Has a multiplayer mode along with campaign mode that can be played by several people.

Cons:
-Still in early development, lots of concepts are unfinished.
-AI allies clump up whenever attacking or resource gathering, making them very susceptible to area of effect attacks.
-Campaign mode randomly warps in allied ships for you, making your own war efforts feel miniscule.
-Resource gathering is slow because refineries cluster together towards resources instead of spreading out to better facilitate logistics (i.e. shortening the distance between mining location and resource depositing).
-Lack of HUD makes player response to threats slow and almost ineffectual; allied AI either have the threat handled or get completely blown up before you're even able to get to a spot to support them.

Recommendations:
-Add a HUD with a tactical map to help locate threats and resources.
-Improve Camel AI to repair allied fighters that are in a resting/defending range around the allied mothership.
-Improve refinery AI to spread out to improve logistics/economy.
-Add squadron commands along with the ability to assign ships to wings such as a strike force, mothership defense, or refinery defense. This could be done by making the mothership into a pilotable ship that you can't control its own movement, but can direct your allied forces from like a command deck. 
     >There also needs to be attack and retreat commands.
-Adjust how allied ships randomly spawn-in during campaign mode. While random elements are fun, I feel that this game is advertised towards the kind of player who plays games where their efforts and strategies make a clear difference.

Ideas:
-Give Campaign mode either some meta-progression or a way to improve things in between levels.
     >Possibly utilize in-game resources to improve weapons, hitpoints, economy, etc.
-Add options to reduce random allied ship spawning. Some people may enjoy that aspect of the game, so adding some customization could be appealing.
-More multiplayer options? While I did only play campaign, it appeared there was just one other mode available.
     >Capture the Flag
     >Resource Race
     >Dueling Mothership defense (I'd do something like campaign with two opposing motherships flying opposing parallel or just parallel paths)

Flappy Fox.

Background is cute, fox is cute, music is cute. That's all the good I can say about it.

There's no special effect for hitting a building. Instead, the game just [i]disables your jump button and lets you fall.[/i] Also, the hitbox doesn't match the sprite really well, so you'll seem to die randomly without even knowing what you hit.

"Great DLC. Adds a lot of desirable features. Hyper Relays are fantastic. The new origins are fun. The new megastructures are useful, and the new enclaves are cool for adding more options to the game.
 
However.
This DLC and the 3.4 update that has come with it is the buggiest I have seen Stellaris in a very long time. After just a couple of games it is very clear this update was not properly play tested. Paradox is already aware of this and is working on it, but there is a mountain of problems. On top of that, a lot of the features of this DLC are unbalanced as hell. Orbital Rings and Relays seem alright, but the quantum catapult seems very weak except in extremely niche scenarios and the new vassal mechanics, which seem cool on the surface, are interaction nightmares, with the actual mechanics of going about them shrouded in mystery and confusion. And for some reason, you can't boss your vassals around, they are always allowed to say ""no thks bro"" to changes in the contract. Like I'm sorry mr. pathetic fleet power, but if I want 60% of your minerals I should be able to take them.

A list of a few bugs from just a couple games.
-Randomly being incapable of establishing branch offices on random planets. I have a hunch that AI megacorps can make invisible branch offices that take up the corporate slot but players can't see for whatever reason.
-Can't do duration trade deals with other players. Like, at all.
-Manifesti event chain gets stuck in log (not a new bug, but fix that shit)
-Wanderlust event chain gets stuck in log (that's new, I think)
-Merc Enclaves are bug ridden to hell. They randomly give me small fleets of a couple of ships, which I don't think is intentional, and they don't move their ships if you terminate your hiring contract early. This allows you to park enormous neutral fleets in the capitals of enemy nations during a first war, leave them there for ten years, then just hire them again at the start of you next war. I was playing a megacorp with a 5 merc enclave capacity, and at one point I just couldn't open up the diplomacy screen with one of them anymore. Another one I paid for and placed down, but the fleet I used to create them just disappeared and the enclave never created itself, but it still used one of my capacity. Fun.
-The GDF fleet can be composed entirely of Titans right now for some fucking reason. might be the same for fed fleets.
-You cannot see estimated travel times anymore... except for when you very rarely can...
Edit: Oh yeah, you can't do over time trade deals at all rn either",0,1

"[b] *Received for free as I was an Early Access player* [/b]

[b] TL;DR: [/b]If you're low on money, you don't miss out on anything by not buying it.

The items are nice, but most are reskins of other very common in-game items and you'll be replacing them anyway a few hours in. They are only relevant for those who have played Larian's previous game, [i] Divinity: Original Sin 2[/i], as they are references from that game. The only actually useful item is the [i]Mask of the Shapeshifter[/i], which gives you free uses of the [i]Disguise Self[/i] spell (and the spell itself is not one you'd use that often).

The [i] ""Aventurer's Pouch"" [/i]can be sort of useful, especially if it's your first time playing, but, similarly to the D:OS2 items, you're probably going to be finding enough and better resources a few hours in (I didn't even use it). 

The dice reskin is just that, a dice reskin (and at first can be sort of confusing since they replace the '20' with the Larian Studios logo and the '1' with a Mind Flayer face). The paintings are more of ""unofficial collectibles"" since you find them hidden throughout the game, but can't really do anything with them until you've reached the city and rented out a room at the Elfsong Tavern (mid Act III).

The artbook is nice and shows a lot of interesting stuff; having the soundtrack in the other hand is great for easy access, but the average person can just find them on Youtube or Spotify anyway (the composer has his own channel / account).",0,1

"Note: Sorry if there are some spelling mistakes in my review. English is not my native language.

1. First look
When I first started the game, I could choose different categories, and a daily puzzle.

2. Controls
You can select words with a mouse. You can click in 'Hints' if you want a hint. 

3. Concept
The idea of this game is simple. There's a field with characters, and you need to make words with them. There are multiple categories, each with their own theme. Each category features a different amount of puzzles, and you get hints after completing a category. A puzzle features, most of the time, multiple words. You also get 10 hints when you complete the daily puzzle, which is 1 long word, instead of multiple words.

4. Difficulty
As I said before: This game is simple but fun. It fits almost perfect in the category ‘easy to learn, hard to master’. The concept is simple, but the levels are getting harder as you progress through the game. It’s a nice game to play after a long day at school or work. Not too simple, but also not too complex. However, because I play it to relax, I missed the ability to skip a level after a few tries. However, you can try a different category first, and come back at a later moment.

5. Bugs
Here's the downside of the game: It contains a lot of bugs.
[list]
    [*]The puzzle sizes under the categories are incorrect.
    [*]Some words are spelled incorrect.
    [*]It deleted my save file MULTIPLE TIMES.
[/list]

6. Verdict
Because of the bugs, I simply can't recommend this game. However, if they fix the bugs, then it's a nice puzzle game.

"This has potential.

Buuuuut... It's horribly unbalanced.

First of all, the artillery is horribly overpowered. Especially the precise one. In terms of cost, it counters all units.
Tanks (that nearly 50% more expensive)? Oneshot. Machineguns? Oneshot. A big group of units in a trench? Oneshot.

The only thing it doesn't oneshot is the heavy tank, and it grievously damages it instead.

The fact that it is so cheap yet so powerful with no actual counter makes it pointless to use expensive units. And even then, if you stack too much small units, it still wins the cost-effectiveness ratio. (5 riflemen and it's cost-effective).

The existence of artillery stops you from making defenses (In a World War 1 game, that's ironic, to day the least) because a single artillery strike will destroy everything for cheaper than it cost you to build. The gas artillery, albeit less broken because of the existence of gas masks, is still strong. Its ability to oneshot maxed machineguns (Thus, you guessed it, making it cost-efficient, because 360 vs 520) means that it is still efficient.

Oh, and please, make it so the machineguns actually hit something. A machine gun alone could stop an assault in WW1, here, you put a blindfold on the shooter after giving him a lot of alcohol. It's a miracle there's no friendly-fire.

I'd still recommend because of the potential it has.",0,1

"I got this game on a deep sale (50% off). To be fair, I like it, graphics are good, sound is good, its a keeper for $3.99.

However. It really only has 10 locations, but the dev mixed it up with things like cabin in the rain, same cabin in a thunder storm, same cabin in the day, etc. So, I'm not willing to say its 20 different locations, for its half that.  The other head scratcher is why the game needs access to my network. I denied the access on the first startup of the game, for it made no sense to me. I could just be over paranoid with the game request. Perhaps someone else can shed some light on that game request. I would think all updates would go through steam, and not handled by the game itself.

It seems interesting for a free game made by an indie dev. But you literally can't get past the point of trying to get into the first air vent you come across. You're meant to crawl through, Half-Life style. But the games own pen-point, precise, physics will not let your character model through the vent opening. It's literally just because your character's model has a hitbox that's just a few inches to tall to fit, as well as the crate that you stand on is too short. So you're stuck in the limbo of being perfectly sized and positioned to [b]not[/b/ be able to get through. If the dev can/will fix the specific physics bugs like this, then I would say it's worth grabbing for the low, low, price of free.",1,0

"If you are expecting something akin to Artpose, Easy Pose, JustSketchMe, DesignDoll or maybe DAZ but specifically for detailed foot poses, this is NOT the app.

There are pre-set poses, and you can select them to see, but that's it. You cannot adjust the pose yourself, which makes it infinitely less useful than I had hoped. The thing is simple: If I am bad enough at drawing to NEED a posing software, then I probably need to adjust the poses myself. If I am good enough to pass that function, I probably don't need a software to begin with. Drawing foot is not that hard. Human hands are far bigger challenges. Pre-set poses are not that useful.

So yeah, I cannot recommend it for drawing.

And let's just make things clear: Even if you are not using it for drawing but for more...exquisite tastes, I STILL don't recommend it. Get off Steam to buy some more dedicated games that scratch that itch better, the content creators on Pixiv fanbox or whatever site you like to visit will probably charge you less than FIFTEEN US DOLLARS.

"It's a bad version of Albion Online, although something is charming about it - maybe the old school vibes. There's a few issues here I'd like to call out:

1. There is almost no content, you'll blast through it in 1 day unless you want to just spam grind mobs to level up all skills.
2. The map is tiny, like extremely small. This factors into number 3.
3. Because there's not much to do and the map is small, max level douchebags in full gear will camp the only PvP zone and will 1 shot you and take all of your stuff. They will camp there for hours on end all day and stop you from progressing.
4. Bugs - yes there's bugs and some questionable design decisions. Only the person who gets the last hit gets credit for quest kills (including people in your own party). The major annoyance here is to progress your main campaign and unlock some important skills you need to get the last hit on 2 mobs that only spawn ONCE A DAY. Good luck.
5. Resource nodes. There's like 2 resource nodes on the entire map and everyone wants them. Good luck getting armor crafted, you'll be running around naked or in leather for a while.
6. Tying into item 5, if you're a mage you WILL be naked for the majority of the game. If you wear Leather or Iron armor it reduces your magic to uselessness. Your only option is cloth armor and again, see item 5.

"It's ok.
I don't care about the civ changes to the Persians or the architecture changes. They're nice but it's not what I want to talk about.

This is an ok DLC campaign expansion. You've got three campaigns with five missions each. You've got some nice throwbacks with old AoC characters which I appreciated (even if they're traitorous snakes). Beautiful map designs, great voice-acting. Those areas of this DLC I have absolutely zero issue.

But, you are not going to be challenged at all by the AI in this expansion. I ran through on Hard and by the time this game released to this review a couple days later all three were beaten by attack moving 30-40 cav at a time to the objective. 

Maps are resource rich, you will never suffer for gold or stone. Your losses mean nothing and with all the gold laying around you're never going to be punished for throwing your men away. You can quite literally make any unit you want in these campaigns available to you and just tidal wave that one unit every mission in all three campaigns. 

AI rarely attacks and when it does it's reminiscent of AoK ai. Minimal waves spread out with anywhere a dozen to two dozen units per wave. 

Some missions were nice, and should have been historical missions so they could have been fleshed out, like the 4th Thoros mission (crestfallen waves). You load in tasked with clearing Byzantine docks around Cyprus while dealing with two enemy ais on Cyprus itself. You're given two allies but functionally just one doing anything. In between fending off the AIyou can theoretically raid the civilian inhabitants to get extra resources. Big map, lots of enemies, theoretically it'll be a challenge to defend yourself on land and go on the water to finish the objective..right?

Wrong, AI rarely attacks you or your AI companion. Naval AI occasionally sends fire ships to your docks. It's quite literally make 10-15 galleons and 2-3 dromon and finish the mission in fifteen to twenty minutes. IT started off looking amazing and then felt incomplete as I played through it. This feeling is on every single mission in this DLC.

I don't know what happened with the developers here or if one or two were working on each campaign, but I think it would have been better to just have one or two campaigns that had actual depth versus the three ""wide  and as deep as a puddle"" campaigns that we have currently. 

4/10. Buy in a seasonal sale when it's discounted.

"  It's a simple form of Candy Crush that lacks the endorphin rush of that continuous multi-matching effect and even then that will usually only happen automatically once you finish a level with extra clicks left. The levels don't become more difficult, per se, but the number of clicks becomes unwieldy low, suggesting the use of funds to buy certain power-ups, this in themselves does not promise any actual help. Or, you can play the same level multiple times until an insane lucky hand is dealt. Which brings me to this assumption. After MANY attempted level plays, I noticed a pattern. The way some levels are set up seem pre-designed and impossible to complete even with or without power-ups and within a set number of clicks. Once you get past Level 400 this all starts to be more and more apparent. When that lucky setup is there - you can see it, you can feel it. It seems intentionally designed.
  I am not saying that this game is bad and that you shouldn't play it. Nope. It's simple and passes the time. Money spent on this game doesn't promise actual level help. It may increase the chance but with my gaming experience, it is extremely marginal. Save all your earned power-ups and stuff until you get to level 400. Doing the lower levels a couple times is worth the extra replay to save for the much much more difficult levels.
  Many times when I do finish a level I don't feel rewarded. My thought process is thinking about the next level and how many times I might need to play it and within so many days until I get lucky. And join an active group, you can get extra lives.",0,1

"Alright. **Zenful Journey** is done and dusted. The *Hike* series of games has a couple different gameplay loops. This is the 'find a bunch of locations and call it a day' variation. Inarguably the most frustrating format this dev uses, especially since deciding to remove location achievements in favor of releasing simple open the game for a guaranteed 100% cheevo style of game. I imagine the guaranteed 100% offers a few extra sales for the dev, so whatevs.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3022650503

It was fully Steam Deck compatible.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3022650338

Anyway, this is an asset pack walking simulator as with all the previous *Hike* series. Each entry typically adds a new asset or two, and this one is no different in that regard. Same three songs on a loop of course, lol.

I see a checklist in one of the product page vids. This was not present in my playthrough. Fortunately, walking the mountain loop reveals most of the locations and you can see the tree from almost anywhere on the map, meaning you only really need to actually search for one location before completing the game.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3022650292

I was gifted this game from a friend who knew I'd played the previous entries, and it was appreciated. I would've bought this on sale otherwise, and that's my advice to y'all. Buy for under a buck and enjoy a very casual half hour of walking through a pleasant asset pack forest.

I'm gonna start of with the great parts. This game has wonderful graphics and music. The animation is superb, and there's even a nice combo system in here. The arcade mode is pretty short and punchy. you could probably do it in 30-45 minutes assuming you don't have too much trouble.

first issue I had as soon as I booted up the game is that I can't assign my own buttons in the config menu.

So it's important that I'm able to change my buttons as I please. I wanted to map the four main buttons to [b]A,B, RT, and LT [/b], but the predetermined settings only changed the face buttons. some macros are mapped to the shoulders and triggers, but i had no control over that. 

Gameplay wise there was just alot of small minor details that added up to being a big problem overall that affected my experience. Here's an abridged list

* the grappler's dropkick isn't active the entire time he's airborne
* His throws aren't a good crowd control option, and you can be left open after doing them and not knocking anyone down. 
* You can't dash at the edge of the screen (this cost me the killing blow on a boss)
* Hitboxes are weird in annoying ways
* at the end of pre boss segments, the game instantly teleports you to the boss, so there's no rest period to get food before the boss. 
* this is probably a skill issue, but the block button seems nearly useless. Most blockable attacks are easily dodgeable, and the hard to dodge attacks are unblockable. 

There's also the issue that some unlockable are gated by beating arcade with specific characters, which I generally don't have a problem with, but can be off putting to ppl that don't want to put in more time learning another character. 

There was probably some other things, but these are the main gripes that threw me off as a fan of the beat em up genre. I think if you wanna get this on sale or something go for it, but it's not good at the level that I'd earnestly recommend it to someone. If it seems like your thing go for it.",1,0
"TL;DR: the game has good design, but is dragged down by bad UX and lack of polish.

the game features several rogue-like campaigns within which we navigate a nodes map. combat encounters take the form of hex-based tactics-lite gameplay. the nodes are procedurally shuffled each time you start a new campaign.

at the start of a campaign, you select a hero and two nameless sidekicks. you wil be able to recruit a third sidekick (total 4 party members) during the campaign. as you progress the game, you will unlock new starting characters.
each character has 3 tiers of skills, and starts with their two tier 1 skills. the characters can be leveled up during campaign, unlocking one tier 2 and one tier 3 FOR THE RUN'S DURATION ONLY.

campaigns are short, like 30min to 1h. the meat of the game is to complete achievements that unlock new characters, then to level up those characters' mastery level to unlock all their possible tier 2 and 3 skills.
at the core, this system is nice because it plays into the rogue-like philosophy of the game where you are expected to do multiple runs of each map (the game even tells you that in the loading screen). it feels a bit grindy but I like it and it's okay since it is optionnal.

the tactics gameplay is fun and nicely ballanced. careful placement and playing with freeze/stun/root and knockback are required in order to keep you units alive, which I enjoy. very well done.

my real issues with the game lie in UI/UX design, reinforced by the lackluster pc port.
- there is no option to show enemies' danger zone. you need to check the range of each of the enemie's skills, remember it and count for yourself
- during a character's turn, YOU CHARACTER IS ALWAYS SELECTED. so you can not click on an eneny to see its traits, this shows you the path to move/attack. you need to select them in the ""turn queue""
- the hitbox when targeting a hex seems to be biger than the ground and/or extend with the unit that is on. I had several misstargeting when a small enemy is next to a tall enemy it. it should be even worse on mobile
- no preview of the stats that will be gained when leveling up a character during a campaign
- bigest QoL lack: a common feature in tactical games is to allow movement cancellation until a skill/attack has been used
- the game does not let you restart an encounter. it is unofficially possible by quitting to desktop then continuing the campaign where you left at, it will restart the encounter. as a result of the previous two bulletpoints, it happens that a fight is doomed by an unintentionnal error. do you really want to play by the games rules and restart you whole run in those cases ?
- bigest let down since all previous kingdom run games had it, there is no encyclopaedia to easily access the enemies' stats, skills, etc.

in the graphics department, like every ironhide production, the game is absolutely gorgeous to look at. every sprite and animation are so lively, it really shows the mastery they accumulated from doing this artstyle for over a decade 👌
for the pc port it would have been nice to have a borderless windowed display that does not go in background when the windows is not focussed, it is very anoying for dual+ screen setups.
also the startup ironhide logo plays sound even if the sound is set to 0 in the game's settings. not that big of a deal though.",0,1

"Version 2.3 - FANF + Lobotoy Corporation with a touch of Undertale at the end. Short but hard. 'Mostly' EN translations.
              Music and Art are GOOD, price is way cheap. Achievements/Stages/RNG (aka get stuck) can be very FRUSTRATING though.
              The game turns from quiet observation into memorized, preemptive button smashing in the last stages which is just sad.
""Black Fog"" was the BEST STAGE, but now it can end before Reaper even attacks, no longer scary...

Problems: [SPOILERS]
LOTS OF SPELLING MISTAKES AND WRONG WORD ORDER. SOMETIMES WRONG NAMES.
SO MANY KEYS TO PRESS (and randomly spamm w button) AAARGH. NO CONTROL OPTIONS ""KEY SETTING"" OR EVEN ""KEY LIST"" ?!?!
[I selected ""Power Pack"" buff in lv6 and learned the key in lv10.]
PLEASE reduce ""Laughing Screen"" amount of ""w"" pressing too from 7 to 5or3 maybe... SAME with ""Rythm of Life"".
RELIC SCENES ARE TOO FAST. PLEASE ADD A GALLERY SO PLAYERS CAN WATCH/READ THE STORY.
If the player can't see it in the hectic level, there is no way to ever see again what happened... (old man + young child story)
DIFFICULTY: Many Levels aren't easier, just shorter, usually. Still harder even if not listed as ""nightmare"".
""SCREENPLAY"" Stage is too hard. FIX: Shorter Question / More Time / Answers Sorted / Less or Easy Numbers like ""20"" and ""848"" not -7153...
Reading takes too long / too much attentention. Like: ""Name Entity (attack)!"" instead of ""What is this entities name? words words words words words words""
Lv13 Encroachment WAY TOO HARD. Assist mode and ""To The Heavens"" are completely useless, too many instant kills like Gray Killer/Last Breath.
Twisted Love/Thirst ALWAYS looks at the player and never stops looking, and then makes a strong free attack. No Counterplay?!
The Ghost Boat moves even when the noise is very LITTLE or MEDIUM??? The Blood Executioner attacks if ""ANY"" noise not LOUD noise??
Bonus Level & ALL ENTITY: Merciless EXTREMELY HARD. 1 mistake and it's over. Shortage, Boss Rush, Blackout not even that hard...
 ...lots of random chance when Entities chain impossbile attacks together, same can happen in other stages/ ALL ENTITY RUN:
 For example, ""press w"" against happy machine+anxiety+laughing screen+rhytm of life and/or (encroaching) silent laugh can't be done, it stacks too much button smashing + no visibility + no reaction time.
 Example2, ""press 1-4"" against the random timer of Stay Tuned with blocked screen of
 Happy Machine+Black Reaper+Dreamer of Freedom+Blood Executioner making a kill+Anxiety+Dream of Can x2+Little Believer+power outtage+stage effects
 Example3 ""death by forced camera zoom"" (lonely wait/reaper) when Lying Shephard/Dreamer of Freedom/Red Moon/Laughing Screen is active -
 Explanation: Reaper+Dreamer makes you wait 3seconds while Troublemaker attacks +3seconds, then Shephard +3s then Happy Machine/Anxiety/Dream-Can... -> too late, insta death to Lonely Wait combo!
 The same can happen with ""Forgotten Director"" > Lonely Wait < Lying Shephard attacks. The player cannot stop Lonely wait while trapped in Directors attack and dies the moment it ends...
 Bad game design. Why does Lonely wait not attack when the timer is ready, but waits for the player? Or why is Lonely Wait's attack timer not stopped while Director attacks? Hrm...
Achievements: MOST achievements are hidden and Korean only in steam = Completion takes TOO MUCH random luck and TIME.

Bugs:
Wrong tooltip: ""Press K to estinguish <Black Reaper> throughout the level."" But he will kill the player when doing so.
<Blood Executioner> levels up even if the player lets ""Lean Against Anxiety"" die on purpose without execution.
Challenge Mode: Display Bug. When playing more than 1 time in a row, the old entities will still show ""active"" but the list will be empty.
If the player disables the old ""active"" ones, they will be added... Only ""reset"" fixes this.
Also the highscores do not save correctly, like most Entity win and ALL ENTITY best time. After game restarts, an old best time will show.
Lv5 - Black Moon can't see in the darkness + Battery Lamp can't see when the generator power is offline.
Lv6 - Coexistence Charles can attack despite right vent being closed with enough power in the generator if Trojan attacks.
Lv9 - Red Moon bar is on top of Anxiety bar... Story pictures (relics) can block the screen.
 Happy machine can even be on top of that, and if the player dies, relic scenes can still play
 and Happy Machine screen can cover the lose screen menu.
Lv11 - The ""memorization question"" isn't displayed at all. (SEE MY STEAM PICTURE or https://i.imgur.com/bTwRSRM.png )
 Also cam1 ""snow + melt button"" can glitch into cam2 screen when using cameras from rightmost to leftmost.
If too many ""info"" are displayed, it will also show some korean texts that I cannot read.
The Ghost Boat can show a backwards move animation when rushing more than 1 full camera at once and player didn't look in a while.
When getting ""memory relic4"" the level will not be highlighted like other relics, but stay black.
Bonus Stage - Boss Rush - After surviving 154 seconds there is no ""victory"" icon. ""120s to clear"" ?!
Editor: Missing translations & button to edit/remove player made stages...
Costume Menu: Evil Laugh = Glowing Eye but no icon here.

Oddities:
Lv8 gives letter4, it hints the relic3, but only lv9 with letter5 gives the relic3. I kept repeating lv8...
Some Entities unlocked before appearing, Blood Executioner lv6 (appears lv9). Trojan not listed as Entity until very late despite early appearence?
Sacrifice Game can give ""Trojan Vaccine"" in levels without Trojan ?!
Why does Loneley Wait fix the player if he doesn't use a camera? Also when using black moon the camera glitches by 1 room.
Why does Happy Machine cover the vision if the player doesn't use the camera?
Why does Troublemaker cover all 4 camera if she only hides in 1?
Why does Executioner executing people cover the screen instead of the respective camera?
Many pictures / names seem confused/random/reversed. Why are some levels shining before / after beating but not all?
ENTITY SCREEN: Why are relic entities shiny but not the respective level entity?
How about embedding different threat level entities with a ""colour coding"" ? Many instant killers have a red shine icon but not all.
INFO SCREEN MESSAGE: Some harmless entity attacks (troublemaker) are marked as RED ""life threat"" danger?
Executioner (axe murderer) kills female child: she sounds like a guy.
Lying Shepherd: looks and acts like a girl.

I did not particularly like the first area and I was really disappointed by the third area, which felt like it was gearing up for a music puzzle or something, but is actually just a bunch of noisemakers with no game mechanics connecting them.

"Very fun concept and gameplay, but GOOD LORD is it in need of a re-balance. The mini-bot class decimates everything else, just because of how tiny its hitbox (and general size) is and how mobile it can be, since its a walker. Its normal to walk out of your spawn, and instantly lose all your HP cuz someone 1/4 the size of you ran circles around your robot and cant even get shot back in retaliation.

The minibot simply should either : 
- NOT be in the game at all
or
- Have its health cut down to a third of what it currently is (it has about the same HP pool as a Buggy, which is more than 4 times the size of it) and remove its ability to jump.

To put in perspective of how strong it is, every single person I've come across that used it has insane K/D ratios of 10.0 or more, meaning on average they knock out 10 people before a they also get knocked out, every - single - life. At the end of the game, its normal to see someone with 30+ kills and little to no deaths. I fail to see that happening because of pure skill, as every match I've played without anybody using a mini-bot was much closer.

Played about an hour and a half of the game, and up until the last thirty minutes I haven't encountered one. Once I did, my opinion completely changed on this game. It 100% ruins the enjoyment since there is absolutely no counterplay except to try and face them in your own mini-bot, which I failed to mention costs 16000 in-game currency to buy, so its not available to everyone at the start. I gained about 5k in game currency in my playtime, which was mostly gained from matches without mini-bots decimating me. I actually cant find any matches without someone steam rolling the other side by abusing the class now.

A lot of people are also complaining about how strong some weapons are compared to others, but the mini-bot issue is 1000x worse and def needs to be fixed above all else.

TLDR; - An overly meta-defining class makes the game completely unenjoyable to play, and to boot, isnt unlocked from the start, making the game a seal-clubbing paradise.",1,0

"Quick port review from a surface-level glance (only did a playthrough of vanilla arcade on DS1, check other reviews for info on DS2):

The biggest thing everyone is interested in is input lag and slowdown accuracy. On my end with Vsync on, I feel like the input lag is the same as the Degica PC port which is great. Slowdown feels similar to the recent console ports (Xbox One/PS4/Nintendo Switch) but it's definitely no X360 version; there's a bit more slowdown in the CITY CONNECTION ports. Even then, it's hardly a big deal and I'm fine with playing it more safe by having slightly more slowdown than less.

Aside from that, DS1 plays identically to its console versions. I've not encountered any bug as of yet and I did do a quick peek at my replay and experienced no desyncing so far, though I didn't watch the entire thing. This would be an easy recommend but that brings me to my next point...

The icebreaker here is the price-point. While the game does come with both DS1 and DS2, the price is pretty steep for a couple of old games you're buying digitally and the DLC is literal highway robbery costing more than half the price of the bundle just for 5 characters. I've bought this game more times than I can count on one hand and I still think that this pricing is ridiculous. 

Verdict: This is your go-to if you want to purchase the games on PC as the Degica port still has a lot of missing slowdown. Recommended - but only if you're willing to shell out the money or if the game is on sale or gets its price slashed.",0,1

I've also found myself stuck on a section with no idea what to do, having to look up how to clear that segment.

"Although this budget game is fine for a few rounds, you'll quickly forget about it because of the repetitive and grindy gameplay.

The story barely exists. All you need to know is that the cars have been infected by some sort of virus, and it's up to you to save the city. 

The city is divided into two parts and is quite small. The first part is the safe location where you may buy cars and cosmetic items. You cannot, however, choose what to purchase. The item is chosen at random from all the options. Because there are no upgrades or stats that would distinguish one car from another, it makes no difference which one you drive. There are more than 40 cars and more than a hundred items categorized under wheels, decals, and drift effects, so there’s a lot of choice.

And the other part of the city is where you destroy enemies. You won't have to waste time hunting for them because a mark over the car indicates their precise location. They won't intentionally try to kill you, but they will collect and use power-ups. After eliminating all enemies, you return to the safe zone and buy new items. Then you back into the fight.

Enemies can be destroyed either by crashing into them or by using one of several power-ups hidden in cubes all across the city. You have a pretty basic arsenal at your disposal. There’s a bomb that destroys everything around you and a bullet that can pass through walls. The good news is that you never run out of power-ups because they respawn virtually right after being used.

Crashing is not that fun. If you hit the car from the side or the rear, you lose some health but the enemy takes a lot of damage. However, if you collide head-on with the enemy, damage is dealt to both of you equally. Since the car gets damaged with each hit, you’ll have to watch out for pick-ups that patches you up to full health. 

You quickly come to the conclusion that crashing is simply time-consuming and boring. You only need the bullet, nothing else. All you have to do is get the enemy icon in the screen's center and fire. Even if the enemy is on the opposite side of the city, the bullet will still strike. 

In addition, the game doesn't introduce any fresh ideas. Every round is played in the same location with the same enemies. There is no change despite the game's attempts to add chapters and story bits provided by generic characters that mention more hostile and numerous adversaries. I didn’t spot any difference.

The game uses an excessive grind technique. If you want to get every car, you'll have to endure the only stage multiple times because the car costs 5k and you only get about 2k per round. 

Graphics are fine, but a lot of it is borrowed from pre-made assets. I’ve seen the same city and same textures in several games. Unfortunately, optimization is not ideal. Slowdowns occur even on the lowest setting, so the three preset choices are meaningless. On top of that, you can't turn off the unappealing white fog that is pouring from beneath your wheels. It is ugly and is most likely the root of poor optimization. And finally, the loading time are too long. You need to wait each time you buy something or switch screen.",0,1

"Fall Girls is a bit of a tough game to recommend at the moment. It without a doubt has some decent level design and some fun challenges, but it can often feel a bit clunky and sloppy at times. The game as stated on it's page is not multiplayer at all, but it does have some NPCs for you to race against. Unfortunately these NPCs are entirely a cosmetic addition and have no real actual impact on the game play. There is no requirement or even extra reward for beating them.

The game does some things well such as the time trial levels which are definitely tightly tuned, but always fair and challenging. The only real major problem I encountered as far as level design was the fans on the platform level do not boost you high enough to complete the course, so the game may be unbeatable until a patch is out.

I would also like to mention that there is no true H content in the game for those interested. You can unlock a couple mildly ecchi swimsuit CGs that do look great and are well animated, but are not true H content. The game is also unfortunately not one hand playable as you'll need to use both your keyboard and mouse.

Overall the game is a pretty decent parody game that you can kill an hour or two with, but without any real H content, it's a bit hard to justify it's current asking price.

If you'd like to see a closer look at what the game has to offer I have a short video review over on YouTube.

"Not sure if they broke this game or not. Its spawning multiple groups of mobs on the first encounters wiping the party out. The starting characters also don't have any starting funds or equipment. So you have to try a suicide run without and hope you get back out. This isn't quite what the original was about but okay. First level is supposed to be easy not plow you off the start. That's for level 2. Will continue to update but so far its not really any fun. May uninstall, I'm not sure yet as I'm only 10 hours in so hard to say. Music and graphics are good, The game play is not enjoyable though.
Update: I'm another 26 hours in. That first level is still off the chain. I've been down to level 6 and have encountered 0 fights of equal difficulty since level 1. It might be the nature of the beast on how the encounters are developed. Maps are challenging along with the enemies. ""Instakill"" hasn't been too much of an issue yet compared to the original. The high level ninjas in the original would wipe you out. not so much on this one. Overall level 1 is harder than the original. The next 5 id say are challenging but more balanced (still taking fatalities) . But i will say its gotten more enjoyable now I'm past the level 1 created character chipper. Its still stings to roll for an hour just for the advanced character party to wipe out. its the only con right now. ",0,1

"this game is pretty cool the art style is nice and the animations are alright. but the one thing that made me kinda upset, is the bosses most of the bosses in the game are pretty fun but the witch boss is really annoying one it won't let me jump why'll shooting which makes the boss so hard and i think its a little overboard with some of the bosses i played to the western bull boss and the 2nd phase is way to much. there's so much flying on your screen that i can't really win without kinda getting lucky. and also i can't win because there's no cooldown for when you get hit so i'm constantly getting hit. and i think the settings need to be improved. but yeah i don't recommend playing the game Now but maybe when they update it to make it better. anyways i think this game could be really good but yeah!!

"[h3]100 Christmas Cats?[/h3]
100 Christmas Cats is a point & click game in the vibes of ""where is waldo?"" but with cats. The game is part of a serie of ""100"" hidden animals or objects.

[h3]The Pros[/h3]
- This is a simple game (mechanic): click on the cats. I mean, you can't do much more.
- The game has some options that are not present in some other games of the series, a nice menu, a leaderboard and else.
- Some of the achievements are quite easy to get, and change from the other games (just finding cats). 
- It's ""free"" (first level).

[h3]The Cons[/h3]
- If some cats are clearly visible, some are really hidden in a way that it doesn't look like a cat. seeing a like half-circle with a cross? Yes, that's the butt of a cat. It's a bit sad, seeing how the other games are doing, this one has some really bad ""hidden"" cats.....because they really don't look like cats. 
- 2 achievements require the DLC and one require for you to wait 1h in the game. Maybe not the best for achievements hunters.
- The leaderboard menu is SMALLLLL. I don't even understand what the icons are representing.

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
It's an easy game that shouldn't take you too long, but after seeing some of this serie, I would redirect you to other games of this serie. But if you want to spend a bit of time and like this kind of game, feel free to test the first level before buying the 2nd one.",1,0

"Completed Twilight Town in 70 minutes flat. And that was with a few minutes of secret hunting in some of the maps.

I wouldn't call the game ""funny"" but it is indeed bloody. I guess the humour is in the weapons. Reloading: You retain the mag but toss the pistol. You just slap the charging handle of the MP5, no mag swap. And with the Garand it's a railgun. Nothing to laugh at but it keep things lighthearted. Other than those 3 weapons not much funny to see or do. Perhaps there were animoo references that went over my head.

The levels are easy, with the Bosses being small difficulty spikes. No Difficulty selection, you get what your given.
Not much variety in enemies. There's a deflection mechanic which I didn't use. Not used to this type of thing in games, much less in an FPS. With that said the enemy projectiles are to difficult to see, making it a waste of time/health to even bother. Expect for 1 Boss that required you to deflect her attacks back at her in order to damage her. I also didn't use the time stop mechanic, expect for the last 2 bosses. All of the average enemies die so quick there really is not a need for it.
Sped through the game without much thought or fun. 
There are 3 characters that speak (plus random enemies/Boss chatter) through text dialogue at the top of the screen. You'll either not read it, because you're busy running through the maps and killing enemies. Or you'll have to stop in your tracks to read it. 
Especially awkward in the Boss fights. The Biker needs to be shotgunned and the 'Deflect to damage' Boss needs to be told to you via the text chat WHILE the Boss is attacking you.
The story and information delivery is awkward to say the least. 
£6 for 70 minutes of very linear, OK (not fun) gameplay and no other modes/challenges/extras/NG+/Difficulties to give reason to play it more. I don't regret trying Twilight Town, but can't recommend either.",1,0

Reviews like ""I shouldn't have bought the deluxe edition...the first DLC is historical flavor which should've included in launch, and now I'm getting this graphic staff that doesn't change anything about the game play.""

[h1]""JUST CAUSE IT’S CHEAP…""[/h1]
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2984463062

[u]Here's The Thing:[/u]
You see the world, now in the wake of the KN028 virus having ravaged it and turned millions into zombies, through Alfred’s eyes and suffering is the life many are all too familiar with… He wakes up one day to find his brother Jake has gone to seek out one “Captain Jack” who’s supposedly taking in survivors. Antsy that the worst has happened, he sets out to catch up to his only family before it’s too late ~


[h1][u][+] PROS;[/u][/h1]

[h1]:) A-HA, SEE WHATCHU DID THERE. I’LL TAKE YOU ON~[/h1]
Plays somewhat like a mutated sister of [b]Resident Evil’s (RE)[/b] tank control and [b]Silent Hill’s (SH)[/b] 3D over-the-shoulder camera! A welcome change that then immediately plunges you into familiar territory as well as mechanics like having precious ink ribbons to save progress, storage boxes, green herbs to munch on… or snort. Well, you get the picture; an obvious homage that doesn’t bother to cover its tracks.

There are even minuscule brain teasers such as cracking number combinations, the now-obligatory sliding picture puzzle, way-finding to proceed to the next area, and the usual birds and the bees of survival! You should be right at home with the combat seeing as it gets the job done despite being otherwise elementary and not going overboard on the weapon variety.

The first run occupies roughly 3 hours on account of the hard-hitting zombies and a handful of careless deaths. $2 for a RE-like title seems overly generous, but alas there’s a catch- several in fact. See you in the cons~

[u]TIPS:[/u]
1) Knife can stun-lock the zombie goons.


[h1]:) PLAYS YOU LIKE A FIDDLE, BUT THAT’S OK… FOR THE MOST PART.[/h1] 
The low-poly graphics grant it that dose of PS1 nostalgia which would’ve been enough to sway your judgement, but the list of locations you’re to frequent; however little the actual resemblances give it that extra kick of reminiscence towards the named survival horror games regardless! The vacant city streets are grand and disorderly, their presence only extending onto the areas you’re to frequent. Whether it be a derelict apartment building where hope goes to inhabit before committing suicide, a police station that’s seen better days just longing for crime, a hospital so desperate for patients it will inflict- so on and so forth.

I appreciated and adored the sound design more than anything it had to offer visually… It complemented the loneliness and deathly silent atmosphere by having you walk-run with either nothing but the noises you make or the snarls of zombies. RE/SH-ish music only materializes out of thin air in safe rooms (if even then), boss encounters, jumpscares, and when Alfred literally whips out his instrument to strum away and sing a tune~
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2984465756


[h1]:) A NIGHTMARE… RE-CREATED!? Z FOR YOURSELF![/h1]
The plot is largely exempt of any profound influences and probably the most original out of everything! That said, the searching for family plot line gave me throwbacks to [b]RE2[/b] & [b]SH (1999)[/b]; the looking for a safe haven- [b]RE Afterlife[/b]. The minutely open-world design of a city in ruins recalled specific instances of [b]SH Origins[/b], [b]The Last of Us[/b], and [b]I Am Legend[/b]. Seems like a lot of watered-down caricatures, but they didn’t come off as such. It appeared to genuinely attempt (emphasis on this) to tell a heartfelt story that could rival even [b]The Walking Dead[/b] only more close-knit and small-scale~


[h1][u][-] CONS;[/u][/h1]

[h1]:( MORE LIKE, THE DEAD AREN’T ALL DEAD!?[/h1]
While I’m most thankful the narrative isn’t as heavily plagiarized as their previous entry[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadeGuard98/recommended/2363930/] Evil Is Back[/url], which by the way they’ve gotten away with, this time they’ve reached a new low… What’d they do? Well, they copied RE & SH in a “style over substance” manner and once more have to lean on nostalgia for crutches! This particular endeavor grossly reminded me of[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadeGuard98/recommended/1978010/] Delivery Man (DM)[/url], which was yet another game averse to the word “new” and inserted only what they themselves thought were the most telling elements of what made a RE title!

This naturally led to the existence of previously context-laden puzzles which shouldn’t otherwise belong here for they defy all logic. With the only explanation being, well, other than the fact that the OGs had them back then; ergo their inclusion is more than justified. Despite DM doing it a tinge better, both were outright starved of any worthwhile personality or memorable characters… serving solely as placeholder “remember that more interesting individual in RE/SH? Yeah, good times”.


[h1]:( ON THE MAP ALRIGHT- FOR DIFFERENT INFERIOR REASONS.[/h1]
I was feeling the locations initially, but variety did JAKE all in taking away from the reality that they were subpar in their dressing and layout. I thought the apartment was the biggest offender with rooms that differed little to none from each other. But really, every single area was ridiculously spacious and identical in their environmental storytelling thanks to repeating props… Almost as if to exclaim “forget interesting set pieces, we just need places to pad the runtime” which becomes gospel in the next cons~


[h1]:( NOT ON THE RIGHT… BACKTRACK![/h1]
You would think “RE-esque title” and “fun” are synonymous, well think again; the latter is aggressively as well as aggravatingly replaced by long bouts of backtracking. Sheer amount of plot-bending done to allow for key items to be found in places that, in a sane world, would have zero chances of being associated! This key with no discernible markers whatsoever must open that locked door from halfway across the city…! DUH!!

The bullet sponge bosses painfully drain the fun out of the very sad amount there already was. To add insult to injury? 2/3 of bosses could’ve been easily bypassed by simply ignoring them had you been permitted to use your brain. It’s only cause the game forces you to deal with them by making that completely unobstructed gap and the door that wasn’t locked suddenly inaccessible. Lastly, the degree of inventory stupidity going on whereby picking up similar items don’t automatically pool them together and so you have to slow travel to safe rooms to dump your crap. It’s just a whole thing to artificially pad the runtime in terms of gameplay~
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2984468786


[h1]:( CLEAN UP YOUR ACT. PRETTY PLEASE!?[/h1]
Put simply, Twitch streamers rarely make for good voice actors. There, said it! At least pick the semi-decent ones much like[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadeGuard98/recommended/2026870/] Night at the Gates of Hell[/url] did. If I wanted disinterested & soulless reads that border on hilarity, I would just view an adult film~


[h1]BUGS:[/h1]
x Entering a new area, the camera does this thing where it flies towards the player-
x 2 of 3 bosses can be exploited through environmental means.
x Alfred clips with certain objects
x Camera stutters when touching the environment
x Textures keep changing place…
x Auto-aim disabled when an object gets in your way.


[h1]NITPICKS:[/h1]
~ Gun reloads automatically…!
~ Map opacity is terrible.
~ “Files” menu has more slots than there are notes! Misleading.
~ Short black screens after QTEs are jarringly intrusive.


[h1]""DON’T MEAN IT’S EXCUSED FROM A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED RIBBON!!?""[/h1]

[u]Last Words?[/u]
Scarily basic survival horror that bares too much of its muses… Save for a few scraps of novelty & sincerity; winds up feeling derivative, ill thought out, and rushed. “Affordable” came at a price~

"[h1] It feels like a completely different game compared to the first part. [/h1]
The visual style has almost completely changed. Removed low polygons style.

[b] Flaws [/b]

❌ The version for closed beta testing is still unfinished, a lot of bugs. 
In my localization, text has moved out, ugly fonts, and incomplete translation ...

❌ Game hasn't encyclopedia to see what this or that skill does in the game or what property means, etc. For beginners who have not played the first part, it will be very difficult to understand the game in general.

❌ The inability to customize the game's own difficulty, as it was in the first part.

❌ You can not see all the characteristics of the character, as in the first part, only the inventory.

[b] Pros [/b]
✅ A new more tactical combat system, with the ability to move heroes. Thanks to this, skills such as combat range support have become more good.

✅ Quests in cities remain the same types, but have become more thoughtful, now there are no quests with the same rewards.

✅ More emphasis on the story.

✅ New mechanics, such as choosing your starting equipment and upgrading it with lore, traits, or renting a mercenary in the city to help in battles!

✅ Beautiful graphics and visual design, while the game is normally optimized and even a potato pc will launch it

✅ New classes of heroes, skills, items..",0,1

"Eight new songs from various genres and artists are included in the Essential Hits Pack, an intriguing piece of downloadable content for the game. Despite not really fitting with the game's content, several of the tracks I feel suit surprisingly well with the gameplay and flow.

[b]What benefits does the DLC offer?[/b]
[list]
[*]There are now eight additional tunes in the game from various genres, giving the player more options.
[*]Six of the eight tracks, in my opinion, go well with the gameplay and flow of the game.
[/list]

[b]What was lacking in the DLC?[/b]
[list]
[*]The majority of the songs don't fit the game's concept at all.
[*]I thought two of the tracks were terribly monotonous and tedious.
[*]I personally find it challenging to follow the beat of Paramore's song Misery Business with any kind of weapon due to it's extremely fast pace whilst also trying to juggle other things.
[*]For individuals who aren't interested in various musical genres, it might be a little too pricey.
[*]The new tracks don't have music layering, thus your fury won't affect the song the way it did for the other tracks in the base game and Dream of the Beast DLC.
[*]It is extremely risky to stream the new tracks because of potential DMCA legal action as the tunes are licensed.
[*]The DLC feels that compared to the prior DLC, which provided additional tracks, weapons, and outfits at a lower price, it doesn't actually give much for the price. The tracks from the Dream of the Beast DLC also included the layering function.
[/list]

Overall, I really like the most of the songs this DLC offers, so for me, it was just about worth the purchase. Even though I liked it, I personally can't suggest it because the negatives far outweigh the positives in my opinion. If you enjoy some of the new musical tracks, I definitely suggest purchasing the DLC when it becomes available on sale. The DLC strikes me as a little odd because the game was developed on the base of metal music, which is literally reflected in the title, and its primary target audience is metal enthusiasts. The game's themes are also very much in line with the metal theme, but not so much with the others. Nonetheless, it's a good idea to test whether other genres might work with this type of game. Although this was a good idea, I personally hope they stick with metal music for future material and that this is simply a filler DLC while they work on something that has more depth.

"Great humor, cute designs, and a great start.  But there are a lot of problems that are too intrusive, and too prevalent, to recommend at the time of writing.  Biggest for me is hit registration (attacking enemies, dash bubbles, and interacting with the diving surfaces), plus the complete lack of invulnerability when getting hit.  Also, there just don't appear to be good home zone control.  Several times there were enemies that strayed impressively far, and doggedly chased, way beyond what one would expect.  Lastly, and it may just be me, but I had a lot of issues with judging depth in this game compared to the other 3D platformers I've enjoyed over the years.  Even though I may sound harsh, I still enjoyed a lot of my time in the game and I'm eager to see the continuation of the developers and these characters.  Practice makes perfect and this already shows great promise.",1,0

"Released before it was really ready for TSW2 which seems to be the norm for Skyhook Ganes the BR 187 seems have had some fixes done to it but since it's functions any further fixes are unlikely. 

Externally it's nice but the sounds aren't exactly the best and the only loco I've used with a unnecessarily long set up for headlights. Cab switches and dials seem to have no audio which is just lazy. Four wagons are included to bulk up freight operations, four scenarios and a Journey mode for the Schnellfahrstrecke Köln with only the original timetable being used. Around 55 services are available for the original timetable and about 49 for the new timetable.

Ideally suited for 1000t+ freights on challenging grades the BR 187 makes a good substitute for the BR 185. The plus side for the BR 187 is that overlays onto multiple routes for more variety including, *routes I currently own*:

Main-Spessart Bahn
Hauptstrecke Hamburg - Lübeck
Hauptstrecke München - Augsburg
Hauptstrecke Rhein - Rhur
Nahverkehr Dresden
Rhein Rhur Osten
Rhur - Sieg Nord
Schnellfahrstrecke: Kassel - Würzburg
Tharandter Rampe: Dresden - Chemnitz

The PZB is set to U by default but it can be changed to either M and O if required. Keep in mind you have to select the mode BEFORE turning on PZB otherwise it stays at it's default setting.

AFB does work but there's almost no explanation to how it's turned on compared to other German trains. Move the stick fully forward and after a few seconds pull it back to the desired speed you want then move the throttle to about 60% and the brakes will release in a few seconds.

I got this as part of a bundle so it was just under 50% off and overall isn't worth the full price at all. If steam had a neutral rate option this would be rated as such.

It might as well have been a cartoon, but instead you are forced to progress each frame as you watch.  
I picked up a few of the games in this series when they were on sale, and they weren't a good decision.
Constructive Criticism would be for the dev to repackage them all together, vastly edited down to 2 or 3 minute stories that you work through.  Then we get the money shots frequently after not too much plebian clicking.

If you're a competitive player who wants that little edge in competitive multiplayer, then it's really not worth it. It adds just two new civilizations that aren't exactly revolutionary or meta-breaking, as well as taking the time to learn them. In fact, according to [url=aoestats.io/preview] a limited week-long data of ranked matchmaking[/url] by the time I'm writing this, they're actually [b] bottom ranking [/b] for both [url=https://archive.fo/m5HqM] 1v1s  [/url] and [url=https://archive.ph/5kGLT] team games [/url]. You don't need to buy this DLC to get the coincidental patch with a rework of a civilization that you can play in the base game (the Persians). 

However, if you play a lot of singleplayer and non-competitive multiplayer, and/or you think the Armenians or Georgians are cool new additions that you [b] really want [/b] for whatever reason, then the price would be worth it. The three new campaigns are decent and can fill a lot of extra time. In addition, it's fun having extra mechanics and new stuff to learn about the new civilizations. Who cares about win rates and the meta if you're just having fun with people who don't care if they win? Yes, I'm also talking about the AI.

All in all, I got it because I didn't want to miss out on the new civilizations, and I liked AoE2 DE enough to not mind paying the higher price, albeit at a discount. When it did finally ""come out"" (there was a public beta where you can test out the Georgians for free or Armenians if you pre-ordered), I didn't regret it that much because the new civilizations are quite fun. If there was one more civilization, one more campaign, one more architecture set, or just anything else that can be added, I think it'll be worth it for everyone even at this price.",0,1

"Had potential but you can tell it's half-baked, a real shame. this is probably one of my favorite franchises of all time and I'm only ""enjoying"" it off the love I feel towards the series as a whole. If you know nothing this game's PowerPoint presentation of a story will invest you 0% and make you care little to nothing about the source material. The gameplay is kind of fun I guess feels generic and like you can only do so much with it. sometimes nicely animated cut scenes bring this to life, but they are short-lived as they immediately follow up with a slideshow of the next 3 to 4 episodes narrated over. Also, the fact it only covers 45 episodes out of 100 is criminal there is so much story left to be told and I don't think it will ever be told to be honest nor should it be told if the way it's gonna be told would continue to be like this. 
missions are short and it's like OK finish one mission go to the Overworld view hit the next mission or story mark, it's poorly executed and ruins any potential immersion you would've had with this game. Can be best described as a mobile game.

Overall I give this a 5/10 simply because I love the series otherwise an unbiased review would be more like a 4 cus this game is some poopgurt.

If you love this series I guess you might enjoy reliving some of it but overall it's not worth 60 bucks. maybe 15 and that's a robbery still.",1,0
"This game is meant to be an homage to the slashers of the '80s. As soon as you start playing and hear the soundtrack it becomes very clear. I have to mention that the antagonist reminded me of Bubba Sawyer - the [i]Texas Chainsaw Massacre[/i] was released in the '70s originally but the slasher genre got fame (and kicked off a lot of franchises with their sequels) in the following decade.

As the synopsis says we control Amy who's looking for her friends in the woods. There are two levels that can be played independently. The first is about searching for the others. Essentially, it gives you an idea as to what to expect and you can also get used to the game's unique aesthetics meaning a very strong VHS filter that significantly lowers your visibility.

Amy is then captured and you have to escape. You are - presumably - in the killer's cabin in chapter 2 and while your car key lies nearby you cannot just walk out the front door. Some puzzle solving await - as soon as you go downstairs, however, the killer arrives and your job is to hide (while still looking for clues).

The idea is great but the entire game is marred by the ugly VHS filter that you can't seem to turn off. At one point I was not able to hide in a fridge as the killer saw me but during a retry I managed to do so. The A.I. still approached the fridge and waited until I got out so this was another game over. While in a chase you can run but your stamina depletes relatively quickly. There is no sneaking option. You can collect batteries to your flashlight but the filter remains an issue.

It's a free game and I should not dismiss it because I found it difficult. It has some great ideas. Prepare for a very gory game, though.",0,1

"TLDR: Runs perfect on Steam Deck, Lack of polish, Beautiful pixel art, Just too short.

Cody's Nightmare is a run-n-gun platformer focused on boss rushes with absolutely STELLAR pixel art and very little else. It claims full controller support, doesn't support the D-Pad at all.

Coming in at 20 minutes to unlock every weapon and complete every level, I was left wanting significantly better. There's a big heart and scope here that I admire, and I would not have bought it if it did not catch my eye. The lack of sounds denoting enemy attacks, variation in boss patterns, and incredibly choppy level design (combined with bosses all taking less than a minute to dispose each) left me feeling kinda sad about it all. There is great potential from these developers, and I plan to stay following them.",1,0

"[h1]6/10 Overall[/h1]
A hack and slash game with a twist on why you are killing everything. The game lacks general polish but that will hopefully improve. Models are rough, ambiance is bad. This looks like a college level project someone built in a couple of months. Its something worth playing for an hour to see if you like it but at the time of this review the game is just mediocre - not great.

Pros
- Dark fantasy theme that is fun with a good cinematic intro and story plot for being a hack and slash
- Animations are good. It feels solid when you deliver an attack.
- Its a Free game

Cons
- You can not remap keyboard controls and i hate the defaults that are selected.
- Game play/movement is a little off - you should have some invincibility frames when you dodge, seems like you have none. Movement feels off and needs work.
- Graphics are a bit weak despite everything being set on epic like this was made as a mobile game
- Level progression is very slow for difficulty of the enemies. In level one you should be able to 1 hit most enemies at level 12 with a strength of 8 but the difficulty to level is not scaled properly.
- Special fx are bad and look like stock unreal engine assets
- It is unclear what you are suppose to do to get to each area that is locked

Other thoughts:
- Controls on the main page should be under settings and not a separate item on the home page.
- Although you are invincible during a finisher, it is annoying that enemies still attack and mages can drop a duration area of affect/damage where you are standing during the finisher which feels like a bug.",1,0
"This DLC is pretty disappointing with how limited each characters moveset is. I thought they'd maybe be able to do heat actions or something, at least. But its the opposite. Each character plays like they have a full upgrade tree available, but no skills invested and are just at the most basic possible skill, and they also don't have heat actions. I thought we could expect something closer to how Majima and Saejima actually play, but they're incredibly basic. Its disappointing, man. The most epic part of the DLC was watching the trailer, it was kinda downhill after that. Got this as a pre-order, too",0,1

"It's a fun game to burn through like 1 or 2 hours.

But, there're so many bad thing about this game. The ingame character model is way too ugly than advertised. The game won't unlock couple of CGs even when you tried everything. Same with some achievements, even if you do exactly as described they won't unlock. And use 100% of GPU at all time, yeah very sussy.

Also I notice that, there're a couple of publishers/devs on steam that use the same character models and recycle it and throw them into various game of their.

"I have such mixed feelings on this game. It is a buggy, half-finished product that genuinely frustrated me for almost 12 hours. However... I can't say that I didn't find it fun, only really because I'm a Survivor fan. I cannot however ignore the tons of flaws. The explanations in this game are incredibly vague, which means you have to learn things through failing. Though, failing certain daily tasks or challenges can literally mean you get forced back to the start of the game. I frequently lost hours of progress because I didn't understand something and got med-evac'd, or I LOST THE STUPID MERGE CHALLENGE!! Why do I need to spend around 1 1/2 hours surviving the premerge to be given an incredibly difficult individual challenge at the merge, which if you lose you automatically go home. I wouldn't be as mad about the do-or-die merge challenge if the controls and minigames were not incredibly janky and hard to manage. This game was not made for pc, the very limited controls are bizzare, and you're not allowed to change them. The camera angles are odd, and the movement is awkward. Not to mention that most of the challenges are just different versions of you clicking the same 4 buttons. Yet despite that, some of the challenges are almost impossible to lose, while others are almost impossible to win.

This game is the skeleton of a really fun experience, but it needs to be heavily updated before it feels whole. For the first few games I played, I read through the all of the dialogue, and I actually found certain parts to be very charming. I liked getting to align with the crazy Flat Earther, and to have Abi-Maria call me a Narc. However, the character interactions get stale very quickly once you realize that there is very minimal character variety. The game sets up entire personality cards to give the fellow castaways, but it means virtually nothing because the voting and alliance system is trash. You basically just need to get everyone to like you, and you tell them how to vote. You can't have group alliances. You can't get caught for being aligned with everyone. You can't upset your allies by voting against them. From easy immunity runs, to idols that work until 4, to a very basic strategic system, I would actually say that being voted out of the game is the rarest way to be eliminated. 

Anyway, I also need to mention that the dialogue is so badly bugged. Sometimes you will be put in situations where you have to pick sides in an argument, but 75% of the time, some of the dialogue won't show up. So nothing will make sense and you just have to pick an option that usually pisses off half of the tribe. Male characters will also get called she very often, and the same thing happens with females being called he. Also, the actual characters will often glitch out and have their heads missing or turned around for no reason.

In summary, this game is fine... but its realistically not worth the price. I spent 12 hours attempting to win the game, only for me to drag a goat to the end, and I still lost. I had better relationships with the entire jury than the person I sat next to, and I lost 4-2. If this game gets the updates that it needs, I wouldn't be inclined to call this game a cash grab. But as it stands, this is a total cash grab for Survivor fans. 

Yet, the biggest slap in the face is that this game is called ""Survivor - CASTAWAY Island,"" BUT THE PLAYERS ARE CALLED ""adventurers."" WHAT THE FUCK. THEY'RE CALLED CASTAWAYS IN THE SHOW. WHY ON EARTH WOULD THEY BE CALLED ANYTHING BESIDES CASTAWAYS????",1,0

See, I don't hate this skin. If we had multiple variations, I'd use it for the sheer insanity of having Mexican Sub Zero just rock around and thrust people in the abdomen with an ice spear.
The problem I have with this however is that it highlights two things that aren't necessarily the skins fault:

1) Currently, as of time of writing, the Brazilian Pre-Order Skin (Tanya's Funkeira SKin) is currently a skin you have to pay for whilst this is not. I don't fully understand the movie considering Dia de Muertos is the Mexican equivalent of the skin.
2) I feel sorry for the Mexican fans who pre-ordered the game to get this skin. No doubt they weren't to suspect it would come out as free DLC later down the line (Not even a week after actual release).

With that being said, it's a solid skin if not a bit... odd and somehow not a Kung Lao skin. You telling me Sombreros aren't fitting of the resident narcissist Shaolin Monk Netherealm?",0,1
"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1,0

"TL;DR: It's... fine.

I liked the base game a lot. It's rare that I get all the achievements in a game, and I did with Dredge. For its price, it was a great little 20 hours. This? Not so much.

The value of the Pale Reach DLC can be determined by how much of the main game you have left. For someone that's done everything in the base game, this adds maybe two or three hours of real play, a couple of items that have no utility outside of the DLC, and a couple of marginally more useful ones. The new zone is a pushover, but it does have a couple of fun bits of lore. There are more fish to catch, but that's as much of a crapshoot as it was in the base game; you'll find yourself going in circles trying to trawl the last fish up, just like with the other islands.

On the other hand, if you're either just now buying the base game or maybe at the midpoint of it (on the first, second, or third biome after the starting island), it's probably worth picking up. The two items that are middling for an experienced player with a built out fishing boat are actually very useful for someone who isn't quite there yet, and the expansion zone will probably feel more challenging.

I gave this a thumbs up, but it's a very tepid one. For the cost of a Starbucks, it ain't bad. It's just not great, either.",0,1

"I usually don't review games so early in development, but since the developers want it, I wanted to give some feedback.  

I think this is a decent start to a game, and I love the concept, though its current implementation doesn't entirely feel perfect.  I enjoyed the mechanics, and it does feel like there is depth here, especially in considering how your speed gives you advantages, but also limits future options.  That's an aspect of the strategy that I quite like and feels incredibly unique among other strategy games.  

With that being said, I can't help but feel like the gameplay was a bit sluggish and by the end started to lose my attention.  Its hard for me to entirely pin down why it started to lose me towards the end, but I had a commanding lead at the halfway point of the game and my victory felt inevitable but I had to go through 13 turns of fairly tensionless gameplay.  I feel conflicted making this critique because its hard to imagine how things could be changed to resolve this issue without losing the aspects that I do really like about the game.

I do also enjoy the banter between the characters.  They're fun and quippy and it makes everyone come across as likable, interesting characters, and there is a lot of charming humor in the situation.  The bit about Karate Kid subbing in and that whole argument is great.  With that being said, I do wonder if this sort of writing could carry a game that is longer than just a few hours.  What's here is great, though I definitely feel like there needs to be more of an overarching storyline with themes and character progression to truly bring the package together, though I imagine that will come as the game moves from an alpha into later stages of development.  

I should also mention that I appreciate the unique take on sports here.  Most sports games focus on professional sports, in big stadiums with big athletes.  While that can be interesting, I love the focus on the sort of small stakes, after school, loosey goosey sports that kids play.  This take on sports is a lot closer to how I engaged with sports growing up, and its a shame that not many games really tackle sports from this angle, which makes this take really interesting.  

Overall, I had a fun time with this.  I think as a strategy game it is quite unique and I could see the gameplay developing into something really special, and the story and setting are intriguing.  I'm definitely curious to see more of this game as is progresses through development.  For anyone seeing this review, I recommend checking out the demo.  It's short and has some unique traits that make it stand out among other strategy and sports games.  I wish the developers at Acid Wizard the best of luck as you move forward with development.

"Mixed feelings. I can feel the inspiration from a number of games I like (each flawed in their own way). This has the potential for a hidden gem, but it needs a lot of work. There's a significant lack of clarity. Mechanics aren't introduced well, the story jumps from one scene to the next without context, exploration has no clear direction for you to follow. Introducing a time mechanic but not telling us how to use our time effectively is a bad combo; you end up feeling frustrated because there's no feedback. QoL needs a TON of work, even simple things like pressing escape to exit popups do not exist. Everything feels just a little janky and atmosphere-breaking. Even sound design just isn't meshing together (though it's decent on an individual level). It's a game with potential, but whether it ends up as good or bad will be decided in the choices they make in EA.",0,1

"**Edit: I will update the review as there are new updates, so I may change my opinion in the future.

I'd say I'd recommend it if I didn't feel a little cheated. I love the art direction, the characters and overall the game's vibe but after playing several games and reloading multiple autosaves, I have come to some conclusions:

Actually what they sold through their ads, the demo and in general, everything they have promoted through their social media is not quite true. Why? Because although they sold it as a potion store simulator, what they ""sold"" the most was the ROMANTIC factor. And if you want to be able to follow the plot of the game and not get a game over (having to start over from the beginning) you're going to have to practically ignore your possible love interests/friends, since you must manage to create some very specific potions before the competition (in which you must participate). **They have nerfed the competition in their last update so now is easier.

The reason you have to ignore your possible love interests is because of the way they have distributed the time slots (6 in total). Which vanish in a matter of 2 or 3 ""moves"" like selling potions (which costs 2 of those slots) or visiting your friends or shopkeepers (which costs between 1 or 2 or more slots depending on the actions you do). This makes it VERY frustrating to have to combine the ""mini-game"" part that is creating potions and collecting ingredients for the competition and the fact of wanting to advance in the relationships with the characters. A curious thing is that if you advance a lot your relationship status with the characters they give you discounts, but we can hardly reach these levels without neglecting our main objective: THE COMPETITION.

On the other hand, the collection of materials and ingredients also becomes very tedious because it resorts to the random factor or basically ""be lucky that you get just the material you needed before the day of the competition"". 

My proposals would be:
-That the day be divided into various time slots or otherwise set up in a more flexible way to work so that it is simply difficult but not terribly exhausting as it is now.
-Maybe split the game into ""Story Mode"" and ""Competitive Mode"" so that each player could choose whether they prefer a more chill gameplay or want to go all out with potion creation.

I'm actually loving the game, I'm still dedicating hours to it (trying to pass the competition lol). But what disappointed me the most is to find something that I didn't expect, something that I hadn't been sold or shown in the demo or in the promotion. I hope they take the time to read the feedback and consider improving the game system.

I have to add that another element that I dislike is the fact that the game has so many interesting features and only consists of 50 days (5 competitions). Once this is completed, the game is over (?) It's makes me sad! This game has a lot of content that could be extended in a sandbox mode.

**For people who find it contradictory that I still like the game and put hours into it: you can like something and still criticize it. Honestly, I think there is a lot of room for improvement in this game. I love the style and the characters, and the mini-games are entertaining, but they have some negative points IN MY OPINION, which I have already discussed above. ^^ 

I hope you find it useful!",1,0

"Decent concept, somewhat buggy execution.

The basic idea - carrying metaprogress over in a tower defense game - is pretty sound, and while it has been done before, I do like the way this game approaches the concept.  What's more interesting is that you're doing something more like area denial - preventing enemies from leaving the map in particular directions - instead of protecting a brick in the center of the map.

You have three tower types, which, although not differentiated enough, do seem to serve some very slightly different strategic purposes.  (Recommendation to the developer: Laser turrets should probably be significantly longer range than anything else, but also lower damage.  Also they should probably do constant damage as a beam, but be more prone to overheating.  Plasma turrets should probably be much slower, but do something like % of enemy max health damage.)  Each tower has, at present, two upgrades, of which the first is basically mandatory - the starting power of each tower is quite underwhelming.  (You could probably boost the starting power by 50% and they'd still be a little underwhelming.)

You also have traps, or at least multiple instances of a particular trap; it looks like this is intended to be more in-depth than it is at present, which is that there are currently static points on each map where explosive barrels line one side of the road.  (It looks like one map has some kind of barricade that does damage as well, but this appears to only impact civilian vehicles at present.)  These do quite a bit of damage, but consume resources to reset, and additionally take time.  Said resources might be limited?  Although sometimes they seem to respawn over time.  More traps would be nice, here, as right now the resources don't seem to be a limiting factory of any kind, and traps are definitely a nice early game boost.  (I think there's an ideal strategy here involving building only power plants in the initial phase, and use traps to thin the enemies out, but I haven't played to that yet.)

Currently the basic difficulty of each of the five maps is pretty low, apart from a couple of items I'll get to in a moment.  There is a hardcore mode I have yet to investigate that promises greater difficulty.

Before you go into each map, you pick three modifiers (the game calls them skills) which give your defenses small bonuses; one, for example, causes enemy vehicles to slow down once they reach a certain (percentage?) of health.

Additionally you have a technology tree with three branches, each of which focus on a particular kind of tower.  You (very very slowly) gain experience playing the game, which, as you reach certain (high, relative to the rate of experience progress) thresholds, you gain new enhancements.  These are mostly (quite substantive - no ""5% increase"" nonsense here, offsetting the glacial experience gain pace) bonuses to the attributes of that tower type, along with some increases to the effectiveness of the traps.

For each map, you are playing area denial; your goal is not to prevent the enemies from destroying your base, but to prevent them from passing through the area (the use of ""armor"" to represent your ability to fail at this seems a bit odd, but, eh.).  I actually quite like this as a concept - except it isn't clear when first starting in some maps where you're trying to prevent the enemies from going, which feels slightly ""off"" from a gameplay perspective.  As you play, in theory, you're balancing constructing new power plants with building new towers, as power plants, in theory, give you the resources you need to construct new things.  All the while the infrastructure is randomly (maybe?  It seems loosely correlated with enemies being near it) breaking down, and you're having to move around the map to fix power lines and rewire wind turbines.

I emphasize ""in theory"" because it doesn't quite seem to work that way; I can't really tell a difference between one power plant, not upgraded at all, and four power plants upgraded to the second level, in terms of the construction resources produced.  (Called battery power, in the game.)  Some kind of visual indicator over the power plants when they add battery power might be helpful, if indeed they're doing that; additional battery power instead seems tied to damaging enemies?

Additionally, I -think- downed power lines drain your power ""capacity"" over time, which would be neat, except fixing the power line doesn't seem to immediately (or possibly ever) restore the lost capacity.  The final level was, for me, primarily an endurance race of building new power plants to restore capacity that seemed to have vanished forever.  (Was there a power pole I couldn't fine that was just constantly draining my capacity?  Maybe.  They're really hard to find / see in that level.)  My experience of this, whatever the intent, is that there is a power capacity bug causing capacity leakage.  It's hard to tell for certain, however, as some things reduce your power capacity (like the period of time it takes to reset a trap), and other things increase your power consumption (like towers); however, at one point I got a notification that one of my power plants was at full capacity.  (What?  Why?  What caused it to decrease?  Or was that just a power plant finishing coming online?)

UI responsiveness is a big issue, particularly as concerns ""double clicking"".  I turn the speed down whenever I need to set off the traps because it typically takes several attempts to get them to go.  Additionally, there are some menu options that ask you to double-click, and these can take several attempts before they accept the command.  In the map, you click to collect certain resources (which, oddly, the game permits you to do even while paused), and it can take a few clicks to get it to acknowledge the request.

Then there is the technology tree.  There's a reset option - I decided, after hitting the first experience threshold and getting an additional point, to try a different tower, and reset the technology tree, which took a few attempts at a double click to get to work.  And went from three technology points to one.  After another reset, I got two.  After another reset - one again.  I think the code that's supposed to add the different rank technology points together is instead just returning after it finds the first rank in the list?  Or possibly there's an off by one index error and it uses all but one - hard to say without hitting the next threshold.

The game could also use a bit of optimization, or else just needs to let inactive threads sleep for a bit (I suspect the latter).  It doesn't seem to be mining cryptocurrency, but for as minimal as it is, it sure gets my fan working overtime.

Overall, in the current state (released yesterday, and still in Early Access, so my expectation is that it doesn't remain in this state), I find the game a bit of a mixed bag, but on net I find it entertaining.",0,1

"Potionomics is an extremely solid economic simulator with a lot of surprising depth hidden under the surface. The deckbuilding is very solid, and the character animations and art style are insanely charming. That being said, for all the aforementioned depth, much of it is also bogged down by questionable UI and design choices that can easily halt a playthrough to a grinding stop your first time around, unless you choose NOT to actually use certain parts of the game.

Pros:
-Basic gameplay loop is very engaging and fun
-Deckbuilding is complex and allows for many strategies.
-Art and animations are very solid and charming.

Cons:
-Difficulty is often inconsistent and not immediately clear. 
- Some systems in the game can (and should) be completely ignored, leading for some of the game to contain ""noob traps"" that can quite literally cause unintended difficulties that can end playthroughs,
-Randomness can be slightly annoying, to the point of determining victory or failure despite nothing else.


Custom orders, intended to be a separate money-making option that theoretically gives a massive payoff in addition to your shop, is actually a significant waste of time in general. Orders often require ludicrous requirements for potion ingredients and their traits, which leads you to spend too much time trying to gather the appropriate ingredients to complete the order. It is actually always better to simply sell the potions being asked for, without caring about the traits at all, as it is flatly more rewarding in both time efficiency and total profit. This type of issue, where aspects of the gameplay are actually best ignored, is very common in Potionomics.

The NPCs are all very charming and have complex, interesting character arcs that are quite fulfilling. That being said, the Hangout mechanic in order to increase Sylvia's relationship with the characters is flat-out pointless and a trap. You cannot max out all the NPCs in Potionomics if you try to do so via Hangouts, as it is quite literally mathematically impossible with the time limits for each week. Instead, gifting becomes the best option, as there is no time expectation beyond spending the 1 time slot needed to travel out of the shop. I had found this out about halfway through my first playthrough. Once again, it is better to flat-out ignore Hangouts for any reason except some extra stress management (which should itself never be an issue as long as your deck is built out well).

Additionally, Potionomics suffers from a confusing lack of replayability, despite having a great many hours of content available to it. Without spoiling the actual story content itself, once you've defeated the final boss, the game ends. You do not have an option for ""free"" or ""endless"" play in order to see all the other NPC storylines you may have missed. This is especially confusing considering it seems to be the most requested post-release feature.

Despite the three above issues, though, the game itself is extremely solid and worth buying. There's a lot of care given to the character designs and art, and the gameplay at its foundation is incredibly fun and strategically engaging. Definitely worth getting!",0,1

"One of those cool ""intuit what to do"" type games with no text and no real guidance, but it's admittedly a bit linear which does take away some of the exploration elements, unfortunately. The way the different puzzles interweave with each other is neat and the presentation is gorgeous, albeit I feel like the last puzzle set dragged way too long compared to the rest of the game. This feels like a small demo of what could be a much more involved game but for what it is, it's pretty cool - just, like, a bit short, as most all the Cosmos 9 games are.

As for the bundle as a whole... it really feels like a game jam that they're making you pay to play. Half the games are either tech demos or just feel... unpolished, and they're all a bit too far on the short side to be particularly engaging. And there's no real cohesion between the graphical design or the controls meaning the whole ""console"" gimmick doesn't really hold up. The whole set is definitely a bit overpriced and even at the 50% off price point I can't say it felt worth the time I spent with them all. 

If you do have to get any games in this pack, Triga is probably worth full price, Linelith and IFO are pretty cool albeit a bit underdeveloped and probably worth it on sale, and maaaaybe Tendy and Frequency Dissonance are worth it on sale but those are hard to recommend otherwise, and the other four are either too tedious or too underdeveloped to be even worth your time, so I'd give the bundle as a whole a pass.",0,1

"[h1] Sadly has not much content [/h1]

[h3]Title: Cozy Fishing[/h3]

[b]Introduction:[/b]
Cozy Fishing is a game about, well, fishing. The fishing mechanic itself is very similar to Stardew Valley, except the bar is shorter and sideways. There are four main fishing maps, plus an aquarium to keep track of each of the 20 different species of fish you have caught.

[b]Graphics and Atmosphere:[/b]
The game has a fairly calm atmosphere. There isn't much to see but there are atmospheric sounds. The graphics are good looking and overall the game has very little visual bugs as far as I can tell.

[b]Gameplay and Achievements:[/b]
The entire objective of the game is to catch all of the fish. Something that can be done within very little time, even the most casual of game fan can finish this game in one sitting. There are no descriptions to the fish you catch, no additional content other than catching the existing 20 fish species. Some fish do seem rarer than others, I spent half of my short game time just trying to catch the sunfish.
On the other hand, getting all the achievements is fairly easy since they are tied to catching certain fish, which as mentioned takes almost no time at all. 

[b]Issues and Challenges:[/b]
I only really found one visual issue, that being on the last map, where water seems to go into the boat but that is by no means any sort of game breaking bug. 
This game is no challenge at all.

[b]Replayability and Longevity:[/b]
There is little to no repeatability. This game is easy to complete and features almost no content. 

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
If you like repetitive games with little to no substance or are just looking to increase your achievement count, then this game is for you. The atmosphere is not nearly cozy enough to keep me playing, especially because of the lack of any sort of additional features. If you are planning on getting this game, I would suggest getting it on sale, despite the low price tag.
 
I don't like not recommending games but at the current state I can't give a recommendation without feeling bad about it. If I could give it something in between, I would.

[b]On a different note: the developer(s) seem(s) to be working on their next game and I'm exciting to see what they put out in the future, since this is by no means a bad game.[/b]",1,0

- It is difficult to play with friends because the ""friends"" tab seems to work only half of the time and the active lobby list takes way too much time to load. 
- Driving works pretty well, until you fall over and have no way to get up again.

"As usual, the AAA price tag, plus 9€ for the editor (which should be in the game anyway, it's a goddamn console), doesn't come close to being justified by the ""new features"" and ""upgrades"" that this edition brings to the table over last year's. Precisely because of this do a lot of people only get every other game, such as every even numbered edition, rather than get every single one.

With that said, I do love the visual improvements to the matches. In terms of graphical fidelity, it's literally the same: looks like FM (like shit). However, the new animations are really good and make the game feel incredibly more immersive. It's something you really have to experience for yourself to really notice. The sad part is, for someone that has never played FM before, if they were to start now, with FM23, they'd still think the animations look ancient; because they do. At any rate, the new animations added to things like keeper distribution, heading, dribbling, touches, and even the net actually having physics now, make the game feel a lot more realistic. Regardless; yes, the new animations are a massive improvement, but the game still looks like it should've come out 15 years ago.

In terms of actual gameplay... it's still the same old FM. It doesn't feel much different. There are some match engine issues that still need fixing (especially on defense), but overall I do feel like this year's edition is slightly better than the previous one. You can still 4231 Gegenpress your way to the top with any team, but it does feel like the series is continuing down a trend of making life harder for the human player, tactically speaking, which I appreciate; although, of course, it's still largely the same FM veterans have come to expect, and won't really pose much of a challenge for any type of playthrough that isn't journeyman, or something thereabouts.

There's the new UEFA competitions license stuff, but who really cares about that? The music and fanfare around UCL competitions is nice and all, but it's a minuscule thing, and most people already used all kinds of packs and mods to make the game more realistic, by adding realistic competition names, logos, etc.

The main criticisms, by far, have to be the complete lack of changes to set pieces (unbelievable that they haven't been touched in years, and the current system doesn't even work properly), and the similar total absence of changes to international management, despite the game coming out weeks before a World Cup. It's baffling that neither of these features were touched, and, to me, really just shows how much the execs. in charge of decision-making care about the series and its playerbase. We are cows to be milked, and nothing more.

I got the game for around half-off (waited for sale + had a gift card lying around), and I think I'm fine with paying €30-something for the minor upgrade that is 23 over 22, since I know I'm gonna be getting hundreds or thousands of hours out of it.

To sum it up: for me, it's definitely an upgrade over 22, but it's a minuscule one that definitely doesn't justify the AAA price tag in the slightest. Even €30 might be pushing it; the only reason I think €30 is about fair is because I'm sure SI paid quite a lot for the UEFA licensing, but were we to talk solely about the effort put into new features and upgrades, even €30 might be a bit too much. So, in short, if you're a die-hard fan of FM, you'll feel at home, but if you get it at full price you'll probably feel robbed, like most people do.
If you're happy with 22, and/or the game doesn't get a big sale within the next 2 or 3 months (any more than that and the release of 24 starts to be close enough to justify just waiting for it), I'd probably just skip this edition. Of course, that is the exact same advice everyone gives everyone else, every year.

As always, I wish Steam had a ""meh"" option, rather than Yes or No. I'll give it a Yes, purely based on the fact that I am enjoying myself (it's FM, I love FM, what can I say?...), but the review speaks for itself.",0,1

"[h1]Experienced on the Meta Quest 2[/h1]

You can view my gameplay & initial impressions here: https://youtu.be/CU_GC8Wptmo

This is not a positive review, consider it neutral. I just didn't think it would be fair to give a negative review given that I only played the game for a little over an hour and there seems like there might be more to the game than I experienced. However, I will say that my initial impressions were not positive at all and my motivation to keep playing the game is very low. 

When I think of good survival games in VR, I think of The Forest, Green Hell, Subnautica, No Man's Sky or Song in the Smoke (only played a little on Viveport). This game doesn't come close to the quality of any of those games. I think the price point is too high for what this game has to offer. It honestly looks like a Quest game ported to PCVR, but since even Green Hell or Song in the Smoke are much better on Quest stand-alone, I just don't see how this game competes with any of those titles, especially on PCVR.

The game is just underwhelming visually. It looks so much worse than any of the VR survival games I mentioned. The game mechanics are also behind those other games from what I experienced. Admittedly, I didn't get very far so it possible this game gets much better later on ... maybe.

Game is running on the Unity Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting steady 90 fps. However, I did notice pop-in which just shouldn't happen on a game with this low of visual fidelity. You do have full locomotion, along with smooth or snap turning. You can play seated or standing. You have button crouch & jumping. 

You can also play the free demo here if you want to check it out for yourself. You can watch my video if it helps. You could also just buy Green Hell for $24.99 normally or right now it is 40% off at $14.99 USD. Live or die, Make your choice.

"There are a lot of positive reviews, but if you actually read them, they contain harsh criticism and negative feedback. Therefore let me give you a fair and balanced review.

Issues:
- Game always crashes (full freeze) whenever you try to set up trains to go too long distances. If the distance between origin and destination train stop is too long, it will freeze.

- No good indication of productivity or satisfaction of input needs. You have to check each building invidually to see if their needs are met. But even then you have to wait and see if the production stops after a while. Why is there no percentage indication? Or a global productivity and needs overview?

- No blueprint function. If you always use the same design and build the extractors and depots the same way on a resource patch, you have to place each building individually each time on each hexagon. Do you want to use the same design on another ressource patch? Okay, keep building from scratch each time.

- If there are factories next to each other producing different products it is sometimes hard to tell them apart quickly. One has a light blue color indicator, the next building is a light grey. Yes, I CAN tell them apart, but I have to take really a close look. Also aluminum bars and steel bars almost look the same.

- Resource patches run out quickly and there is no good indication. You have to zoom in and check on each extractor individually. This could easily be fixed by having a traffic light indication: green (still producing), yellow (soon to run out or output is sometimes full), red (ran out of ressources or output always full/not connected to anything).

- No good way to balance distribution. If you connect several factories to a depot the drones end up only to supply to one instead of splitting fairly. Also if you transport goods via trucks or train it is also difficult to balance.

- If you have multiple depots next to each other, it is not possible to set a ""flow direction"" to where the drones should move the goods. So if you have a train station next to the depots and you want all ressources to go to that train station, the drones will still try to balance out the amount of ressources between ALL depots, which of course makes no sense.

- Cities are randomly placed on the planet far apart from each other. Each city has its own needs. If you want to satisfy their needs you need either produce the goods centrally and distribute them over long distances or produce the goods near each city. The latter means you have to build up production lines 3x over each time there is a new goods request. Producing centrally and distributing far distance is not really an option in the early game because the supply lines (roads) are stretched out very far and it is difficult to balance the distribution in any way.

- You can't select what research you want to unlock next. Once your population grows to the next threshold you unlock the next set of goods and buildings. And your population instantly wants those new goods and doesn't want a previous one anymore. Oh, you have spent time to create a concrete supply to your city? Best of luck, they don't want that anymore. They want something else instead now. Please redesign your supply lines.

- Another problem regarding the research is: You can't check what technologies will unlock next. For example in my current world I have run out of Flouride because i used it to heat the planet. Will I need Fluoride for other technologies in the future? I don't know! Will this lock me at a certain technology level and I won't be able to progress further? I don't know and I can't check. Do I have to start all over, start a new playthrough and save up as much Fluoride as possible instead of blowing it into the atmosphere? I don't know. Are ressource patches running out too quickly? Definetly.

- Water randomly appears at one point and floods your base. Lost a good chunk production of progress and had to rebuild. Also ressource patches that are under water can't be used anymore.

Yes, the game has a lot of potential, but in its current stage, I would not recommend it.",1,0

"Adventure In My Head is an insanely short game that shows you the adventure of yourself and a friend you have named Masha. You accompany Masha on a hill with flowers and a cat until it begins to rain, and that is when you notice the rainbow that is made from the rain that just went away. Masha tells the player she has something for them, but instead the player is greeted to a jump scare from a weird blue monster and then the game goes on to ramble about stuff that leaves the player confused but thinking there is more to the game than there actually is. The game is so short that it makes the player wish they wouldn't have wasted their time playing so they wouldn't have been met with more questions than answers.",1,0

And in ""Cats Hidden in Jingle Jam"" the hidden cats are literally whole cats hidden in the art, not like ""100 Christmas Cats"" where 1/5th of a cat that is indistinguishable from a piece of tree it is in and you have to find it by accident in a random click pattern, which defeats the purpose of actually using your eyeballs to play a game.

I like the new textures and the remodel of the Masked Man. Also, the starter room is cool.

I don't like the concept that the lighter needs to be visible. It is more creepy if the player can't see it. Another thing I don't like about this game is the new remodel of the Red Mist Monster. Sorry, I meant to say SCP-173. I don't know why SCP-173 is replenishing the Red Mist Monster but this makes the game impossible to beat. So let me explain. In the normal SCP-087-B game, there are two types of behavior the Red Mist Monster will follow. First is the 173 behavior when he will move if you don't look at him. And he won't follow you to other floors. Second is the behavior when you choose the wrong hallway in the two hallways room. Then the Red Mist Monster will appear walking towards you trying to make you fall into the hole that doesn't even exist in the UE Remake. SCP-173 follows only the first behavior somewhat. I say somewhat because he won't stop following you even if you are on the different floor. Which makes the game impossible to beat.",1,0

The present one is set in a 1800s-esque environment that sees captain Paul Lange lead his imperial scouts, alongside numerous allies through the countryside, after a major rebellion toppled the government and put the military in disarray. In the past one, you’ll instead play as Rayon Von Eigo, master of his own knightly order and charged with commanding the Shemergard fortress, in place to repel enemy invasions.

Most of the story, in both timelines, takes place in this massive fortress-monastery and its environs. There’s a stark contrast between the past and present versions of the place, with the former being well-maintained and stocked, while the one visited by Lange in the future is not only dilapidated, but seemingly haunted by dark forces as well. What once was a mighty fortress now lies in ruins, becoming a last ditch attempt to shelter a routing army.

The atmosphere is quite excellent, even if the lack of music and sound effects in most ordinary scenes takes away some of the pathos. The different art styles applied to respectively talks, action scenes and narration panels come together nicely and offer some aesthetic variation that is indeed, welcome. With Good Intentions saves most of its soundtrack and SFX for the most important scenes - with a probably limited budget, this is a wise choice indeed.

Main and side characters are of inconsistent make: some quirky and intriguing individuals may arise from time to time, however it’s also true some of the (supposedly) centerpieces of the adventure just prove bland and one-sided (such as Lange’s sidekick sergeant, to name one). There’s a lack of insight in most characters’ personal life or ideas, as there simply won’t be the chance to have any dialogue with them that isn’t related to the main story’s progress. This becomes especially true and evident in later chapters and will be a hindrance if you’re trying to understand anything beyond the characters’ role in the fortress environment. There’s never any further elaboration on the world or lore either, making the monastery seem like a self-contained bubble (and in some ways, it actually is) where no topics except the daily misadventures ever exist. Sure, you’ll hear some rumors and trivia but that’s it.

With Good Intentions is made unique by its handling of death - because yes, in this visual novel you can actually die - as Von Eigo at least. Basically, every time you take a wrong ‘route’, your demise will be inevitable, be it at the hand of an enemy or more mysterious forces. The knowledge acquired from dialogues and actions will however be kept for the next instance of what essentially is a time loop, with Rayon being able to use it to change things to his favor. Each ‘past’ sequence is ultimately a combination puzzle where you die until you find the right set of actions that give a (single) good ending, thus finishing the chapter. In the present, conversely, you won’t be able to die, no matter how badly you may seem to screw up.

On paper this system would be intriguing, but it’s terribly implemented for the most part. Technical shenanigans aside (and those are already enough because let’s be honest, it’s a visual novel, not Space Engineers) there is a clear lack of proofreading and mediocre translation quality; expect weird syntax and wording as common issues. On top of that, the absence of manual saving and the inability to skip to the next choice immediately, when repeating an already-seen dialogue, make the experience tedious because the non-adjustable text speed is too low (even with speed-up enabled). This leads to an enormous amount of wasted time and filler that have no place in any decent visual novel.

Another huge flaw is found in the numerous non-sequiturs (in layman terms: nonsense) related to the causes of death, or to the available choices in some dialogues. On numerous occasions you’ll find poor Rayon dying for arbitrary reasons that at times are not even explained properly, or him suddenly unable to use critical information in a logical way, simply because that choice wasn’t accounted for. It leaves a bitter, disappointing taste to see how much potential was wasted due to mediocre writing and dubious logic.

If you just stack the upgrades on the archer for example, you get one more archer per upgrade and they continually do more damage.

"It only took me a few hours for the prologue, but here are my thoughts.

From reading the reviews first -  I was expecting, like they say, clunky ui, jank, bugs etc. and I can't say experienced it the same like that.

I think the concept is great. The foundations are there, it just needs more EVERYTHING. The overworld exploration part is cool, but atm just being pick up 2 items, bag full, shoot fireball at ghost is pretty mundane. 

You should be able to hover over items before you pick them up. I understand with items like the mirror you pick it up and it's a mistake because you can't pick anything else up. But I think the mirror in particular is a just a bad idea. You should be able to hover over items, see what they are, see the shape etc. and you shouldn't have to delete stuff entirely from your bag. Middle mouse should drop it, otherwise what's the point in giving the items funny shapes if you have no way of organising your bag anyway?

I can't pin point how but the overworld experience just needs improving. I'm not sure what else you could add to make throwing fireballs at ghosts more exciting. Maybe tankier slower ghosts that drain more mental, or faster ones that drain ether. Idk it just seems lackluster. I think it would benefit massively from the maps just being like 3 times the size. It feels really un-intuitive that you could, realistically, start a quest, pick up 3 items, and get to the point and end the quest with 0 fights and in about 40 seconds. I really think having the maps bigger, with less screen clutter/foliage (90% of the time you cant see the items on the floor) would be great.

On the same topic of having a bigger map, I think it would benefit the day/night cycle nicely. I think it's a great mechanic, but with how quick the missions go, it pretty much comes down to  what the listed starting time is. If the quest starts at night, it feels like it'll still be night by time you finish it. A bigger map, maybe a spell for Thyria that fast forwards time at the cost of a permanent ether reduction for that quest, more random events that will change the time, will be a good benefit for the time system. 

The best part of this game by FAR is the guardian management and stones. I think it's genius. I don't know how much goes in to making a guardian and different combinations but I hope there ends up being LOADS. It would also be nice if aside from a passive, each guardian had its own ability, maybe some kind of synergy ability? Maybe some kind of plaguedoctor that could double or spread debuffs from a target, making for a cool debuff based team. Idk just throwing out ideas.

With the last point in mind, I do wish guardians felt more 'unique'. It's cool as hell having a paladin, but aside from its passive, half of it's spells could be used by a bunch of other guardians too. Maybe guardian-specific equipment would be great, like shields/swords/armour that only a paladin could wear. 

Despite the claim of the game being hard, I tried the prologue on normal and hard and I really can't say it was very difficult.
I completed both difficulties with pretty much a random selection of guardians with little investment. It just felt like they did a lot of damage and enemies did not much damage. Just definitely in need of some numbers tweaking I think. 

Overall I'd hope the game has a really good future. I just really really really hope, by time the game releases or comes out in EA, it has a LOT  more features. Please take your time. If you do read this devs, I wish you all the best <3

"As is usually said I wish there was a neutral option for the review. Aesthetics, music, gameplay is still good, but for me, there were a few things that ruined joy.

You could often see in negative reviews for the original game issues with placing your character since you don't have a model, I don't agree with that in the original game since the blocks there are square blocks, so you get used it. Here however you have round tubes, faucets, and god knows what else, add to this some new environment elements from which you can fall WHILE sneaking, and scoring these pixel perfect jumps becomes a nightmare. 

Contrary to the original game where you ( mainly ) get introduced to something new like new jump or new environment element in places where you can safely fall or fall is not a big deal, here you for example encounter water blocks the first time over 200m abyss, while also having to do something around 15 jumps. Some of the hardest jumps you literally encounter for the first time when doing them over 100-150m abyss, and not only you have to do them while risking shitton of progress, unlike the original game where the riskiest jumps were usually the easiest, you actually have to learn how to do them, with every fail taking immense amounts of time. This map is much more difficult, not because of the 'raw' difficulty of jumps ( which is def more than the original game ), but because of the fact that there are sequences of like 30 risky jumps all over the place, some of which are really difficult and require almost pixel perfection. 

Another issue is basically the lack of natural skips and just more 'linear' and at the same time labyrinthine the main route, imo in original game you found skips literally by learning that some jump is actually possible which felt amazing or by noticing some hidden ladder. This dlc also has some such skips; however when I decided to check out playthoughts due to the fact that I couldn't bear the agony anymore I found out that this is some kind of absolute clown fiesta such as jumping 80m down on the new trampoline, and from there on some solitary ladder, there is no way you actually find something like this unless you search for them intentionally in practice mode. Meanwhile in some places you encounter invisible walls. Hell, later in the game you usually get stuck just searching where should jump to do it the 'ordinary' way, not even searching for some skip. I cannot blame the developer since the game is aimed at the people who already know majority of mechanics, but anyway.

I'm leaving a positive review, since the developer allowed assets to be used in custom maps for free which deserved respect, and it was still fun in its own way, but imo I enjoyed this dlc much less than the original game.",0,1

So during my time playing the newest update, full version of the game, I would say the map, world is a decent size. It has many poi's, a lot of the same structures, slightly empty, but there are plenty of things to loot and decent loot, along with the loot refresh being fairly quick too. Building is great, and easy to build something you like. There are obvious bugs, texture & terrain issues (the rock quarry dump site, many piles do not lay flush to ground, and building is visible yet no collision), details lacking, missing audio (trees/stone), emptiness in some areas (building fairly empty), but overall its a great start to a potentially great game. So fingers crossed with the further support of the game and others doing to same, and the developer keeping up on updating, adding, fixing the game, I really feel this would be an excellent survival game.

(Update) The new Torch is excellent, lights up very well, looks good, and makes for navigating the nights a hell of a lot better :)",0,1
"I will update this as it improves. However, it is unplayable at the minute due to no mouse interaction. You can not control the mouse once in the game, so you can only move forward/back/side. Myself and my friends died within minutes of playing as we couldn't go anywhere or turn around to escape the heavily breathing (we couldn't see it) monster. Once this issue is fixed we'll be back, as with all games like this, they always have potential. I shall await an update,",1,0

"It's fine and yet another unreal engine game where you climb random assets that lead you high in the sky.  This game seems unique enough to set itself apart from Only Up! but the developer needs to turn OFF motion blur that currently has no option in the settings to turn it off.  That's just gross and almost enough to make me ""not recommend"" this game.  I hope he removes it because it's as simply as just turning it off in the unreal engine before exporting the build.

I'd also like to see a more obvious path to start climbing up and less trails that just lead you to frustrating dead ends.  Other than those two things, it seems like a pretty okay game that has a lot of effort put into it.

https://youtu.be/b0WPFhF_I_M


RECOMMENDED... but ONLY IF the developer updates this game and either gives us a setting to turn off MOTION BLUR or if he simply turns it off completely himself before exporting.  NOBODY WANTS OR LIKES MOTION BLUR!   .. Nobody!!

"Hmm based on what I have played so far. Yes, my PC meets system requirements.

1. 3 bar connection is way worse than that of Tekken 7, most of the match feel like your opponent is teleporting across the screen. Probably due to how rollback is implemented. Wifi or wired, same problem as I have tested with both. My connection has good ratings based on tests I have done for pings,latency,jitter etc. If your region has less players this might be a problem.

2. Match making takes too long and ping is worse compared to what I get in T7 with people(might just be my isp though, could be different for other people). So searching algorithm should definitely be changed. Rather than checking if connection matches, then match make or not, would it not be faster to just match make if connection requirements are met? In comparison T7 matchmaking is a lot faster.

3. Cross platform is even more laggy.

4. Besides connection, they should also have an indicator which shows us whether hardware of opponent is good enough or not. Weak hardware can also cause lag for online matches. Ability to filter by those specs would also be useful I believe. What good would be a nice connection if someone doesn't have pc strong enough to handle the game?

5. Now coming to louge, it would be better to match us with everyone connected to arcade machine rather than people just sitting besides the near machine. That way we can have variety of opponents. When the group of machines only have like 2 arcades, you would end up facing same guy again and again kinda like what happens in T7,despite rejecting the match.

6. Ghost battle needs a bit of improvement. It doesn't adapt much to what we do compared to real players. On a positive note, these aren't laggy.

7. Ranking system is better than T7. If there is no demotion up to Yellow ranks, newbies may have more people of their level to fight on.  But I hope it isn't saved locally else people can still smurf. Only change I would suggest is, demoted characters also get auto promoted. If someone is bad with a character,it is fair for them to fall down to bottom rather than having someone intentionally demote a character so that they can start that character at 1st dan. 

So that's all I have to say about it, take it as you will.",1,0

there's a 'keyboard enabled' toggle, which is essentially hard mode. if it's off (default state), both arrows and wasd work for movement, otherwise only arrows, as you obviously need letters to type words, though clicking still works. and if you press the wrong key, a bunch of random non-letter tiles appear. the other toggle is for 'automatic word detection', meaning you have to click the tick after making a word if it's off.

"A ""survival"" game with a price that tells you exactly what you're getting into. 

This is neither a deep survival game, nor is it a game with any goals. You are simply dumped into this bizarre playground that makes no sense. Although there are tasks to fulfill, they are of the generic type found in other games. 

The moment you step out of your hut is like a monster Armageddon. There are gorillas, dinosaurs, massive scorpions, and many more creatures all over the place. They'll charge you once they see you, but they're friendly and will wait outside as you enter the hut. You can simply smack them, run back inside, and repeat until they’re dead. 

You have survival stats to worry about, like water and food, but it’s easier to just die and respawn with everything back to full. All your items will be gone, but that’s not an issue because of ridiculous item spawn rate. Various objects are constantly dropping. Swords, food, wizard hats, and blueprints for making new things will appear before your eyes in a matter of seconds.

It's not inviting to explore the map. There's nothing but desolate fields and mountains out there save for the primary spawn site and a few huts. There are also a few cavemen waiting outside, unconcerned about the creatures roaming the area.

"[h1][u][b]Review of Project Speed 2.[/b][/u][/h1]
While Project Speed 2 (Kind of an odd name) does have Unreal Engine 5, it does not utilize it very well, as it has rather low texture qualities, even on the highest quality settings.
The audio design isn't great either, with rain droplets hitting the ground only using three pitches, and only one single sound.
The physics are rather wonky with cars going flying sometimes and the handling of cars being very... interesting, oversteering at around 30 kilometers an hour. 
Project Speed 2 centers itself around multiplayer, as stated in the showcase, however because almost nobody plays this game you're mostly limited to singleplayer, and since there's not much to do it leads to the game feeling very... empty.
Now I seem to have written a bit too much from what I usually do, so I'll just make a simple list down below...

I can't give it too much hate though, as it is still in rather early access, but I feel like there could have been a lot more to this game in the six months it has been out on Steam as of writing this review.

Liked:
Unreal Engine 5
Free
Achievement availability

Disliked:
Low texture quality even with high graphics settings
Bad sound design
Weird physics
Resetting just putting you in the same place you were, but flipped
Lack of players
Singleplayer being very empty
Car sounds being rather monotonous
The only other car is a DLC, costing 0.99 Euros, and is purely cosmetic
No first person view

Epilogue: I really tried to find things I liked about the game, trust me, but the bad things sadly outweigh the good things, but as I said, it's early access as of writing this, maybe in a year or when the game is officially released I might come back and give it another review. Who knows? It might become some Triple A game.",1,0

During my gameplay, the tutorial was a bit rough, but still taught you the core functions of the game and the dev was quick to correct and better the tutorial quickly. As for the server side of the game, it was so peaceful just drifting around in space. Your movement is very smooth and easy to navigate around, with a realistic feel. Harvesting resources was easy, and a lot of fun. The graphics of being in this space universe was just out of this world tbh. Highly recommend to anyone who love space style survival like games, but prepare for a slow start and some grinding a bit, that is until you upgrade your tools to better tier and begin gaining resources with a breeze. The dev and the discord community are very informative and usually pretty quick to respond.

I would loved to explore it more but the sound is a complete immersion breaker. At first I thought it was a bug but its also a part of the trailer here on steam. So  if you can stand that sound or could enjoy to have the game sound off then I´m sure you would love this game.

I was so intriqued by walking around in dwindling tunnels and search for clues and notes but its just not possible to enjoy as it is now ;(",0,1
It's...rough. It can get really boring and exhausting. I'm just trying to finish it so I can say I finished EO1. They should've ported Untold version to be honest. But I want the later EO stuff in Steam so I'm upvoting it I guess. Start with EO3 instead.,0,1

List of bugs and Suggestion
1. Signup button do nothing in first boot, you need restart the game to make it work properly
2. The sound/music sliders not responsive or even does not work at all, i need close the setting and open it again just to turn down the sound(my suggestion to make button for it left to volume down right to volume up)
3. The hit box are f-cking magic fuck-ry you need pray to god for 12 hours to just shoot properly and hit the bot/target
4. The bot is stupid, in my opinion ""bot is esstential for online game with a small number of players especially shooter/strategy"" but if game developers have ambitions to have and/or have huge amount player it wont be a problem
5. The optimazation so bad that my toaster play other 2 games one Triple A and one indie game while waiting the free from lag
6. Game server so wierd and lagging that make me learn and question how Quantum world work
7. After messing with setting in-game clicked apply crash, re open it and crash when creating a game with bot
8. When choosing agent/person before start are so lag
9. The UI is good but could be better
10. Map good but sometimes i randomly fly, get blinded by darkness and get teamkilled by team bot so my suggetion to other player dont turn on the friendly fire. The bot so stupid that i got frustated close the game watch and learn how to make the biological weapon and set it free so people could feel my lovely biological creation

i play this game for more than 25 min now i have dyslexia

"The game is pretty fun, especially if you play with 4 friends in full-team with no randoms. And the open beta looks good - it's very well optimised, not a single fps drop despite the enormous amount of dinosaurs, and the graphics are decent.
But it just not worth the price they sell it for, not even close, and the regional pricing of Capcom is pretty much non-existant.
Maybe I'll buy it on 75% (or so) discount in the future, if the game will still be alive which I honestly doubt because of poor pricing decision on it's release.",0,1
"More of the same, just a couple hours of extra content. It's probably best played before you get into the endgame, otherwise you won't have much use for the ice blocks.

Would have been nice to have new flags or ship colours too.

"boy, the DLC knife E is one of those where the game is trying to do a lot with a little, I would wait for sale, not to say it's bad, quite the contrary it's actually very good, and I had to take my hat set off numerous times and question what the hell I was looking at, seriously there are moments in this where I don't think I can put into words what I'm looking at, it's incredibly funny at times, it does push the envelope here and there again I'm not trying to spoil anything, although when it comes to performance in ran a little rough here and there, there was a lot of clipping with the guns or where my characters arms would just disappear or at the end of an event when a door was supposed to go up it did not open, the ending is psychopathic, if I could give this DLC and number when it comes to links I'd give it a two it's very short, it's a good short, but not for the amount of money they want, when it comes to story all give its a four, when it comes to the crazy insane stuff you're doing all give it a five, if you loved the base game you'll love this although I will warn people, the leading voice actor for the main weapon you used in the base game, is not in the DLC, because the voice actor for him has had allegations of sexual harassment labeled against him, nothing has been proven in court but you know these corporations, they would rather fire people or put people on leave then actually let the justice system do its job, that is what worries me about the future of the cQL if they're gonna bring back, Kenny in general I really loved the base game, because it did not push politics, but this game does it pushes hatred of capitalism and there is a character who is gay, and mentioned that he argued with his boyfriend and is gonna go back to him, look I don't hate people if their gay, but I wanna play a game that entertains me and the base game did that, this one kind of annoyed me with them pushing a couple things in the DLC, I know that the lead actor for the Witcher live action was accused of a lot of false accusations, because he did not push the progressive line, so apart of me wonders if that's what was happening, maybe the game developer  and this is just my opinion what might've happened, maybe because the original voice actor for Kenny, who is also a writer for the game maybe because he didn't push certain progress of notions in the writing department they created a lot of these false allegations in order to get him out of the game so they could start filling it with this stuff, either way I believe this DLC is a step back in the writing department, in certain areas it's a step forward but overall it's a step backward, just make games for gamers stop trying to push politics, because of this I'm gonna have to give knife a down vote, but don't misunderstand me it's a very sad down vote for me, if they didn't put the politics and game it would be a thumb up, but because of this I'm going to have to thumb it down.    Update Justin Roiland who was co owner of squash games has resigned as a member of that company it looks as though they're no longer going to use kenny's character obviously without him, the charges against Justin have been dropped, he is completely cleared of all charges, but as you know that's not going to be enough for some people, if he's not back for the second game and they've replaced his character with a girl, and the fact they're pushing more politics in their games, if it goes to that point then I'm going to have to walk away from high on life 2, seriously Justin is the blood and soul of this game company, when people can make false allegations against you and destroy your life, I know how that feels, I've lost jobs because people made false allegations, so have you guys you need to rehire him and stop this nonsense, seriously I know the signs of a dying company and this is one of those signs.  If you're willing to throw away a founding member of your company who is literally the main voice actor for your game and a really damn good writer, then maybe you don't deserve to have a company.  Time will tell.",1,0

"'You don't know how kombat packs work'
 - Product page mentions the consumer receives the content, doesn't say immediately or later. Based on these aware consumers that left a review shocked how others aren't aware, only one review took the time to mention that the content gets released in time.

'Good quality and Good price'
 - Didn't think I'll see the day to see the phrase 'good price' attached next to metahumans in a 70$ game, good to know.

"The expansion is really lackluster. No new arts, enemies or a big variety of bosses (just the final boss). It's like The Taken King expansion where they recolored existing enemies and gave them a glowing aura. Only ""expansion worthy"" content here is the story which is alright but not as good as the first half of the base game in my opinion, DLC doesn't have any massive implications or impact on the overall plot of Arise. A bit odd considering they took so long to release this especially after making a statement of not continuing Arise's story, so I thought they had to be cooking if they went back on their word. Overall, good to see the characters again but, just like the SAO DLC, way too overpriced, wait for a big sale.",0,1

"Well, I can safely say that this style of game is not my jam. Jank for the sake of it is still jank. I am trying to be nice to this because I don't necessarily feel like I am the target market. The visuals are not bad, but the frame rate suffers A LOT. The audio could use some work. The controls are terrible: sometimes you jump and the guy just jumps in place despite pressing forward. It is difficult to judge the direction of a jump. The character glitches through terrain and doesn't always grab on to anything. Having looked at the reviews for Only Up, this seems like it has the same issues as that minus all the NFT promotion. In the absence of knowledge, I have gone with a thumbs up (because there is no thumbs sideways.) If you like this type of game, this is more of that type of game.

"Where the game is right now its a fun little game for a bit, but level 22 jesus way harder then the rest didn't play much further after that because the camera will zoom in and out get stopped by the edge of the level just frustrating(i think its because there is motion blur or something applied, and its screws you bad when its a tight platformer), the controls are very nice though and the overall feel. the only real bug i ran into was the diamonds would stop counting after level 10 witch discouraged me from getting them.",1,0
