Why did i get this game??? ,1,0
The start of the decent of Call of Duty...,1,0
If you love a game to play by yourself then go right ahead. If you love to play zombies or co-op campaign then have fun spending countless hours on google searching up a way to fix the sh#tty co-op problems that NEVER go away no matter how hard you try. P.S. Fu#k you treyarch for not helping fix this.,1,0

wouldn't mind this game if the community wasn't full of wife beater enthusiasts and Nazi supporters...  just sayin',1,0
"Pretty much what you might expect from a Call of Duty game, for better or worse. The graphics are pretty good, and there are some admittedly great set piece moments, but like every CoD game after the original game and its expansion, the majority of the campaign is pretty tedious and far too predicatable, and the story is really lazy and dumb, despite decent attempts to break the mold by good voice over by Gary Oldman and Kiefer Sutherland, and having the game take place in the Pacific and Eastern Europe, rather than Normandy and the Ardennes as is the case with most WWII shooters.  The multiplayer is definitely entertaining for a while, and I appreciate the campaign co-op option, but honestly the only reason I come back to this game at all is the mindless, yet hilariously fun Nazi Zombie mode; this alone was almost worth the price I paid, and would be the only reason I would consider picking up another CoD game in the future.",1,0

"ok so this game is based on current world issues and stuff and just makes fun of stereotypes and can be offensive and has been really contraversial for ever, like since 1997, and if you arnt a baby its incredibly fun. this is not as good as the first 2 seeing as it was made by a different studieo but its still a good time. not great but ok.its fun if your super bored but Postal 2 is way better.this is like a spin off, even rws says so.  {RWS Explanation}v Postal III didn’t turn out how RWS had hoped. The original plan was for RWS to do game design and style art, with Akella responsible for production (coding, game art, audio, playtesting, etc.). The project started out great with both groups working close together, then the first blow came with the Russian economy taking a hit and Akella lost their A development team and the project got moved to Team B. Looking back now we should have canceled the project then as there was no way the new less qualified team was going to be able to deliver a “A” quality game. The next big blow was when Akella started chopping away at our design (to accommodate the limited skills of the 2nd string team), this only got worse over time. From eliminating gameplay to single player only to PC only and scratching consoles. The hole kept getting deeper and the ♥♥♥♥ shovel was in full force. We didn't even get to see or play the game in the last 12 months of development, then the worst thing happened. Akella was desperate for money trying to prevent going out of business. They made the fatal decision to ‘wrap it up’ at alpha and call it done, releasing it to the Russian market, then on Steam for the international market.  Akella retains control of all the source code and assets for Postal III which they will not share with us or the modding community, so we are unable to fix Postal III ourselves, leaving a flawed and unfinished game. RWS also do not profit from Postal III sales and we stopped selling it ourselves the moment it was clear we would be unable to support the product.  Postal III is not without some redeeming features for fans of POSTAL: graphically it looks nice, the cutscene art and music was decent and it has some interesting unique weapons such as the Badger Saw. The branching storyline and Good versus Bad system allows you to replay the game and encounter new levels, alternative scenes and it even allows you to complete the objectives differently. The game at least knows it’s a train wreck and will often make fun of itself during the objective screens.",1,0

"Yes, the combat is exciting and dynamic. Yes, this game has a huge number of loots... and Yes, this game tons of side quests. Yes, the world is large - OK, the world is gorgeous.  However, despite sinking numerous hours into this game, you'll still find this game somewhat lacking. It has a very uninteresting story. Quests, both main and side, are highly repetitive. I mean, hell - Diablo does have an even more boring story (it doesn't really have one, right?) but I feel a different kind of boredom playing this game - possibly due to the huge world, or samey environment everywhere.  By all means, get this game if you like the flashy combat experience (as said above, it has a decent combat system). But don't expect it to be anything interesting outside of combat. And don't even compare this game to Skyrim, where the world is much more dynamic.",1,0

"Not a bad game for a genre clone - this wannabe fable wannabe skyrim features gnomes instead of dwarves and Fae instead of elves, but other than that mostly conforms to the tolkien rules. The 'young races,' humans (which are subdivided into skyrim-like factions), are in danger of extinction because of the 'crystal war,' where the Fae 'Tuatha' have declared war because ♥♥♥♥ it, ♥♥♥♥ humans, I guess. The player is in the ever-imaginative position of an amnesiac who somehow has mastery of all weapon types, who wakes up as the Tuatha raid a gnommish outpost and from there I pretty much just stopped paying attention. The story is not very exciting.  The 'Destiny' system, where the player can build themselves between the three fantasy rpg classtypes (if you dont know what those are, this game would not be a great place to enter the fantasy genre), is a great idea, especially if you're a completionist and you want to see what total hybridization has to offer. The way the trees build is a little stupid though - there are like 9 types of weapons and you can put points into one weapon type at a time - if you go for full hybrid, like I did, you pretty much just suck with everything, which is what I expected. The level cap is ♥♥♥♥ing 40, which is GARBAGE - there are about 120 point slots for each classtype, so you can basically unlock a total THIRD of the potential of your game (I used a save editor to give myself more points because it was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). Gold is too readily available and doesn't restrict purchases at all, and the gear tries to be like diablo but it just....isn't. The looting is a little stupid. I'd give this game about a C, it captures attention at first but its flaws just rear up and are impossible to ignore. I loved tossing around chakrams and screw-attacking through people with my warrior-rogue-mage hybrid, but I got so bored I just left-clicked my way through the last third of the game.",1,0

"I hoe you guys know what you're heading in to get this knife : big troubles. Cons :  Well, you have to plan a full day for it, starting with the downloading time (2 hours), the updating time (30 minutes), the playtime (15 minutes), and the unistalling time (3 hours, because nGameProtect makes your computer laggy as hell, because I think this game was made by Satan himself). You can easily find tutorials on how to completely remove it on Internet, but following the instructions is another story. Not that you're all idiots, just that your computer need 5 minutes to allow you to click on something. Each time. I advise you to create shortcuts where you need to go to unistall it, because once downloaded, you're dead. Or you'll eat your 80th birthday cake in front of your screen.  Pros :  Well, you've just proved you were ready to do anything to have a free TF2 item, so people will respect you for this so long and painful day, or just laugh at you. But in this case, you can still stab them to death with style.  (Do Not) Enjoy !",1,0

"'What an excellent and profitable game POSTAL 2 is, I wonder how we can profit from it more.' 'Hey vince, I got an idea. Let's get some unexperienced ruskies to develop a terribly buggy and raunchy third sequel that everyone will blame us for and want our severed heads on stakes in their front garden.'

"Grr.  Ok, functionally this game is excellent. Lots of guns to shoot and lots of things to shoot at. However, the improvements made to these areas come at the price of the story and variety that CoD4 had. The result is a cheesy 'cold war goes hot' story where the Ruskies invade America that is just not very well done (if you want a good story in that setting, go check out the game World in Conflict). And while there is some of the sneaky funtimes of CoD4 that balanced that game against the intense firefights, this game is almost entirely big firefights. Make up a list of every thing you would expect to see in your typical hollywood action movie, and chances are quite alot of what's on that list is somewhere in this game. This is the sequel CoD4 got, but not the one it deserved.  Oh yeah, and multiplayer's here too. I actually did try that out in this game a bit, but after a while I stopped due to a mix of being terrible at its high-pace and annoyance at having few to no chances to try out the Spec Ops co-op missions which were actually kinda cool.  If the only thing that means anything to you is shooting guns in games and explosions, then you can have fun here. But if you like story to go with it, then this game will dissapoint.",1,0

"Personally I don't like Reincarnation much since they twisted the game so much and a lot of unbalanced stuffs happened, like the Imp, I always thought that Small Imps are 'tier 1' creatures like they had always been in D2 and the last 2 D3 versions. But not anymore, they are now nightmares for your all tier 1 troop which mostly have around 8 to 12 Accuracy while those Imps have 43 Invasion (you will miss - a lot), and 140 health and 33 damage and 30 Accuracy (they do CRIT a lot, almost all the time) and 28 Initiative... basically, you just can't win against them without using some spells.

"I played this game in the summer of 2011. But, not on steam. On Aeria Games (or that's how I think you spell it)  Anyway, when I first played this game, I instantly thought it was Pay2Win. It was.  But, I gave this game a try. I played this game for hours.  I forgot it was Pay2Win because I played so many events and I earned so many Euros(but mostly from people helping me out, also Euros are in-game money). ______________________________________________________________________ Why was it Pay2Win?  You had to REPAIR your gun. (costs money) You had to RENT the most OP guns. (costs money) You always fought EXTREME PROFESSIONALS ALL THE TIME (well, it really depends). ______________________________________________________________________ Don't get me started on infection mode. Infection mode is basically zombies (players) vs. other players. It was SO hard to kill one single zombie. I wasted all my ammo on one single zombie every game. You couldn't even kill someone as a zombie, so many PROFESSIONALS ._.  There is a rank system, and it was rare to encounter a horrible high-ranked player. Also, there were lots of hackers back then. ______________________________________________________________________  I forgot all about this game. Now there are people complaining about how Aeria Games ruined this awful game even more. Playing this game to get my free TF2 knife brought back memories.  I couldn't enjoy them because of the PROFESSIONALS.",1,0

"Because I'm such a huge fan of CS:GO and CS:S, I decided to purchase and play the original Counter Strike. However good the game may be it's all based on petty nostalgia. If you were to compare the game to CS:S or CS:GO you would realize how inferior it really is to the two. You might say that CS:GO turned crap once Valve added cases and payed cosmetics, and in turn that makes CS 1.6 better than CS:GO. To that I say CS:GO has better graphics (no surprise) and better controls, if it's the payed skins that turn you away from the game then just don't buy skins/cases/keys. Overall I would say based on CS 1.6's time period it's a revolutionary game, however compared to modern choices the game is ♥♥♥♥.  5/10",1,0
"A decent game made when the iron was still hot unlike the upcomming title advanced warfare. (that game is gonna be bad without an ♥♥♥) This game added new kill streak rewards as well as more weapon customization which is not as comlicated as ghost, but still works fine. It was like it predecessor, only more epic and with maps that would become classics. And i must point out that the following titles never had any epic moments such as this game and with more bugs. (Kill streak rewards in this game were alot more rewarding)  But the main reason why i do not recommend this game is the linear campaign which is the formula of all the games in the series, but also that you should not support developers who desperatly try to recycle the old stuff, and add in a dog.   Consumers should be more descicive when ever they buy games. Without the money, talented developers wont be wasted on picking up the broken disc from the garbage bin.",1,0

"A great game left to decompose.   As much as I enjoy playing this time to time, there are a few reasons why you shouldn't get into it. That's all up to you to decide however.  First, the good:  1. Fairly adult playerbase, I guess mainly because most are the original players from the day.  2. I haven't played Campaign in many years, in fact since I completed it, about 5 years ago, but I remember it was pretty good. 3. Fastpaced multiplayer action.  4. This game doesn't attempt at stealing all your freetime like some other games do, it's fun, but not addictive. 5. This works on Mac, I am not sure if other CoDs don't, but one of my friends recently bought this because it was Mac compatible.   Now the bad:  1. Hackers. It wasn't always nearly as bad as it is now. I am not sure how it works exactly, but InfinityWards seems to not have updated their anticheat system for a few years now and just about any lobby is permiated with a hacker as a result.  2. Unbalanced weapons. I'd guesstimate that 65% of all players use UMP, which is a clear sign your game isn't very well balanced. Some things like reloading on the Intervention has clearly been artificially slowed down, to balance stats out I guess, but still, it's not pretty and it stands out a country mile.   3. It's bloody expensive! I mean, this is 2015 we are living here and this came out in 2009 and it costs 20 USD, which isn't far off what it was at time of its release, I am thinking 7-10 USD maybe? I know it's CoD and CoDs must be expensive by law, but still... If you are going to have a 6 year old game still available for purchase, maybe make it more appealing by offering it at a lower price?  4. Playerbase is small, as You would expect, you'd have to work out the hours when most people come on, otherwise tough luck getting into a SnD when there's like one lobby hosted in the world.   5. Motherf***ing Kicktool! I am not quite sure where IW's common sense was when they allowed people to use that thing, my guess is that this supposed to let people rid of hackers, well no, usually it's used by a-holes to rid off people they cannot outskill. Very quite dissapointing.   I would pass on buying this if I were you, I am sure there are better options for your 20 USD.",1,0

"Great game that started the whole Zombie craze! If you buy it, than it better be for the zombies and the zombie mods and maps. However, for the price I would just, well..... not even try.

But don't let the zombies be the only factor on this game.",1,0
"Tl:Dr- Black Rose is a pretty great knife 10/10. Guns are 2OP4Me for me and gives off a Call Of Duty vibe. Pros: - Free TF2 Knife - Get Holy Mackeral in game (Like it matters if you die every two seconds anyways.) - (Debatable) Has a Hungergames style gamemode Cons: - Download took forever - Might as well play COD - Really Overpowered guns - Community is basically a COD community. (Direspectful, ECT.) - Pay to Win - Not much room to gunplay in maps - Mixed between Reality and Game world (Painted, Alien type guns, with actual guns and Women get less body armor?) - A sexualized game to attract more attention from Male gamers despite gameplay not being good. - They try to lure people to play this game when they just needs major fixing to the game, like make a whole new game or something. which they try to fix and I praise for (They did a survey, although if they listen to peoples results is up to them).

There are 2 deadly flaws in this title in my opinion: 1.Too many useless battles,so you usually get bored after 2hours 2.The limited times to use skills,for more times?you need to buy at a high price in store.I really dont know why design like this,so the game gets more and more boring because you dont want to try different skills but only want to end every battle fast,its a big failure.But enemies dont,they always have 10+times to use and they only mean to get you stucked one time,so more and more hard battles but looked the same.",1,0

"Honestly, do the world a favor and buy postal 2, not this. However, if you like the idea of modding, postal 3 is quite easy to alter, that's literally the only upside. As quite frankly the missions are awkward as sin, awkward aiming with weaponry and incredibly clunky melee combat. But then again the clunky melee combat is a GIVEN, it's source engine afterall folks.  Honesty time: Only purchased this to mod it to recreate / attempt to remake postal 1 or 2 features in it.",1,0
"The only negative thing I could find (apart from the difficulty of obtaining the Black Rose and the virus, as people claim) was the thought given to naming the classes.  Rifle Man, Sniper, and Point Man. I understand not wanting to have any similarity to Team Fortress 2, for example, but you got to think your names through. Another alternative would be to give the classes real names.  Lastly, I personally think players are more interested in video games that have a backstory to them. Take Team Fortress 2. The comics explain a great deal of things that happen in-game.  In conclusion, I would give this game 4 out of 10 stars.",1,0

"Postal 2 won't go down in history as one of the greatest games of all time. It probably won't even make the average top 500 list. That said, I thought it was very entertaining. When it comes to Postal III, I'm at a loss for words. I'd prefer to write a positive review, describing in detail on how this game improved on its predecessor. If necessary, I could write a negative review, filled to the brim with reasons as to why I believe this product to be a disappointing sequel. Instead, I'm staring into the abyss.  The Postal Dude is at it again. After blazing a trail of death and destruction through the town of Paradise, he finds himself in Catharsis. Madcap mayhem and wacky hijinks await as Postal Dude tries to find a paying job. Will you somehow find the light of virtue within yourself? Or will you once again submit to your demons, using murder to solve every minor dilemna? Whatever the case, you're sure to be in for a great time. This game also stars Ron Jeremy and Jennifer Walcott. I'm surprised that Lloyd Kaufman didn't make an appearance as well.  This entry uses a morality system. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean The Postal Dude will be helping old ladies cross the street (or into woodchippers). Basically, if you want to be the good guy, you have to abide by the law. Naturally, this requires that you become a police officer, and make the law your own. While this doesn't give you a free pass to endanger innocent lives, at least you're doing your part to make Catharsis a safer(?) place. If that sounds like too much trouble, you can always be evil incarnate. This will result in different levels, and eventually a bad ending, if you don't change your ways. If eternal damnation doesn't appeal to you, there's always the handy taser gun. Non-lethal takedowns slowly add up, allowing you another opportunity to join the force when you complete the level. Unfortunately, the possibility exists that your morality, will be at the mercy of the game itself.  While I applaud the writers for their attempt at injecting more story into the Postal saga, things stop making sense very early on. I suppose this can be attributed to the fact that I had to skip stages in order to progress. Let me rephrase that: I had to cheat* just to complete this game. Aside from the high probability of crashes, there are numerous scripting issues. Some doors are scripted to open when an event occurs. For reasons that can surely be attributed to the troubled development of the game, these scripts frequently break.   To give an example: Shortly after I joined the force, I was tasked with eliminating the homeless that were running rampant through the police station. Eventually I reached a point where a door was supposed to open, but it didn't. I could see the enemy's guns clipping through the door, but there was nothing I could do about it. I restarted the level, which fixed it. However, there was another door later on in the level, and it had the exact same issue. This happened again in another level, where I was supposed to go to the mall, the doors simply wouldn't open.   Unlocking all of the stages in Postal III via cheats is a simple task, but that isn't the point. All that work I did trying to be a good Postal Dude? Gone. Putting difficulty aside, when a game can't be completed without resorting to cheats, that means it is broken.  Postal III tends to feel like busy-work. Most of the levels start off with an extremely boring job, which fits in with the story. After a short time, things get crazy when Soccer Moms or Savage Nerds or Eco-Terrorists or ???? show up. This is the point where you have to kill/subdue a certain number of them so that the level will end. Postal 2's strength wasn't in standard FPS mechanics. A lot of the entertainment came from using the sandbox aspects. It was a game designed around finding different solutions for everyday problems (sometimes without murder). With Postal III, almost the entirety of the product involves shooting, and it is very poorly-handled. The Postal Dude can take cover, but it's so ineffective you're sometimes better off standing out in the open. On the bright side, the enemy AI is so bad they're liable to ignore or even forget about you in the heat of combat. The levels that don't require the player to deal with x amount of enemies, tend to be really linear slogs. There are even escort missions, as if players wouldn't have enough reasons to hate this game.   Aside from severe technical faults such as long load times and poor performance, Postal III also suffers from awful mechanics. Melee is basically useless. Even the heavier weapons, like the fire ax, don't work all that well. One of the items you acquire is a laser pointer, for leading Champ (your dog) to enemies. It is complete trash. The same can be said about most of Postal III's weapons. There's no real incentive to play with them, because they either don't work, or just aren't satisfying. Typically, the average Postal III play-through is going to revolve entirely around shooting everything. It gets old very quickly. Urinating is no longer infinite either. The Postal Dude can't ♥♥♥♥ as much as he wants, now he has to wait for his bladder to refill. Yes, it's probably an unnecessary thing to complain about, but it's still a nonsensical change that adds nothing to the game. Everything about Postal III is worse than its prequel...Everything**.  Some of you reading this review might not care about Postal. You might even think 'It's a garbage franchise anyway. Who cares?' Well, it's just my opinion, but I liked the second game. It was crass, offensive, and sometimes the humor fell absolutely flat. Yet underneath all of the nastiness, there is still a game. Postal III is broken, and is more prone to cause headaches than provide any entertainment value. The multitude of bugs, scripting failures, and generally unfun game-design, make for a forgettable entry in this controversial series.  *While I did cheat to complete a couple stages, I didn't actually try to skip any.  **The soundtrack is pretty decent.

"As a fan of poker and Rpgs i thought this would be a pretty interersting and fun game....i was half right  It seems well enough when you begin. You try to get a combintaion of 5 cards, the attack power being determined on how well it corrosponds to to the poker hierarchy and try to wittle down you're opponents hp. simple enough.  You are introduced to spells shortly after, assuming this is where the tactics come in.....well not really.  The main problem with this game is that it is barely like poker at all and barely an RPG. The attack points could be determined by...pretty much anything else..infact it might benifit from this as what happens 90% is you and even the A.I end up making as many pairs and then full house's as you can with usually lower damage if you try anything else in addition to being harder to achieve. There almost no point in making a higher hand than you're opponent as all it does is take off slightly more hp...i mean ♥♥♥♥ i some what assumed that it might nullify one of his hands....or something..you know kinda like POKER.  The spells offer SOME varity and tactics but not much, the cost vs reward of most spells make them mostly interchangeable.....its kinda amazing actually how there could be so much varity and yet so little.  Overall the only people i can recommend this game to is to someone who wants a simple card game that has some odd and fairly unique mechanics..........but mostly it is a dissapointment and wasted potiental.",1,0
"This game is obscenely huge. My guess is that it's about 3/4 size of vanilla WoW, and it kinda feels like wow. It has tons of dialogue and quests, all of which have voice over. It must have been very expensive to put this thing together.   Combat system is solid, you have to actively move around dodge or parry/block incoming attacks. There are 9 type of weapons and each type lets you perform different moves.  You can develope your character in 3 main ways (destinies). Warrior, rogue, mage or you can mix there 3 trees to your taste. But spending point in trees lets you unlock so called Twist of Fate cards which provide you additional bonuses, the more point you spent in one tree the better cards you unlock (capped at 109 points). There are cards for dualdestinies or even tripledestiny if you choose to distribute your point in all 3 trees, but point are limited so you may not have enough to get the highest tier abilities in trees. And if you build you character 'wrong' or you are bored by one playstile you can always visit a Fateweaver npc who will reset you pints, for a price.  Last but not least there is this  reckoning . It's basicly a god-mode you can activate when your  fate bar  is full, you gain fate in combat. Time slows down and you deal additional damage, your fate bar slowly drains. Whenever you defeat enemy in this mode you can perform spectacular finisher and thus gain up to 100% experince for every enemy you defeated before you chose to finish one.  It all sounds good right? Almost too good, and that is the problem. Due to game's sheer size there a high probability that you will get bored, sooner or later gameplay becomes stale. Also story isn't the best, it starts off with rpg's evergreen cliché, amnesia. And honestly in the end I wasn't paying much attention so I'm not entirely what was the deal with your protagonist.  I'm not saying that there are no player who would enjoy this game from start to finish, but I'm certainly not one of them. It took me several hour to get to it, then I had fun and 40 hours later it was getting more and more boring again and I rushed through last 2 regions (Klurikon &amp; Alabastra). This game has certaily it's value it's just not that fun to play for long. Maybe it's way too big.",1,0

"Runespell Overture is a card game with kind of original mechanic, blending the combinations from poker with tactical moves from Arcomage - where you collecting some points to use them on some spell, which will either attack your opponent or defend yourself better.  Point one is that it is NOT a Role-Play Game, it is only a card game with 'health points' on you and your enemies, and some grades of combinations to win the hand. Point two is that Arcomage - and many games alike - are still Much Better by the terms of gameplay.  As a Pro point, I like the visual stylistics of the Runespell, the way it's presenting itself - it has a good facade, so to say. Game mechanic and scenario combined creating good impression, which follows you in first third, maybe first half of the whole game. But then... then you notice, that the challenge is not anything intense, and just proceeding using quite the same basic combinations - basically doing all the same over and over... and at that point, you'll be not so happy.  The story is okay for that type of game... but nothing fancy or really rewarding for your struggle to beat dozens of almost similar enemies - and even bosses are not much different! To finish the impression, Runespell: Overture is maybe short (about 5-10 hours of gameplay), but holds one bugged achievement, which I can't complete even after 30+ hours... do I need to tell you how I love such things?  Oh, well, I'll just mark it with 5.5/10, and leave it be. Do not recommend, as there are enough of better card games, even in the F2P ghetto.",1,0

"Try this game if you really like action RPGs, but if you're looking for a good, solid sandbox adventure, keep on walking.  The game world is huge, and I mean HUGE, but a ton of it is padding, and with the limited mobility options you're given, it gets really really tedious carting your sorry carcass all over creation to get things done. After a certain point it becomes a series of well-choreographed and engaging battles held together by drudgery and vast amounts of running, and that's even with fast travel as a possibility.  This game was originally envisioned as an MMO, and it really shows. You can't jump on your own, you can't really wander off the beaten path (largely because every path is so thoroughly beaten already) and without a horse or some form of mount you're left to running or sprinting. Calling this game a 'wide-open adventure' is kind of like calling a hike through redwoods with the inability to look up a 'wide-open adventure;' all of the things are there, but you can't really utilize them to their fullest capacity.  At the end of the day, KOA:R feels exactly like what it is: a U-turn into marketability.",1,0

"I do enjoy the game, and I think it is a good way to quench your thirst for a game of this style. With more work this game could have really been amazing. An active modding community would even be plenly enough to save it. But sadly we will not be seeing any more progress on it. I suck at adding pros so i'll just be going into the details on the cons. (sorry if i am a bit too harsh)  Worth the purchase?  I would say the game is worth a buy when it is on sale, or if you are like me and don't have a pc able to run things like The Witcher 3 or Shadow of Mordor.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  + Overall fun gameplay and combat. Easy to get into and can find a good amount of things to do.  + The main story is pretty good. Really new and interesting plot.  + The respec system allows you to completely change your playstyle at any point for a small fee of gold.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  - Poor difficulty scaling.  Apparently when you enter a new area, it locks that area to your current level. So if you progress too fast or, like me, end up charging across the map in search of a challenge, the whole game becomes a cakewalk. (besides a few special enemies that do stupidly high damage compared to the rest)  I have heard that this also works for chests, so looting everything too early will hurt you in the end.  - Conversations seem to be lacking. Persuasion skill is useless.  I quickly found myself skipping through dialogue to reach choices to get past it, that often make no difference besides the next line the npc says. I even tried to make a few npcs hate me but nothing happened. (And apparently I am now lovers with some girl even though all I did was use her boat.)  The Persuasion skill, having 10 whole ranks, only affects the chance for you to succeed in rare, often pointless dialogue options, that you could just pass by quicksaving/loading. There are also a couple milestones in it, but all they do is slightly lower the cost of bribes for crimes.  - Equipment.  Many people say that upgrading your blacksmithing skill makes getting good gear too easy, but it seemed like the opposite for me. With max rank blacksmithing i only ever made a few items worth using since I could never find good materials , and ended up just selling all of my loot and purchasing better gear from shops.  Armor sets just stink. I have done a lot of exploring and looting but have never found more than 2 parts of a set besides when given to me. And even if I had, my gear would still be far better. Same story for most of the special weapons I get.  - Side quests are annoying.  There are a few I have done that I found interesting and enjoyable, but mostly it just became a case of skipping through, accepting everything, just doing them as I went to an area with an objective there.  This could also just be because I have played too many mmoprgs.  - Not enough variety in enemies.  Throughout the game you will be finding the same enemies even in far different settings, such as trolls, spiders, and pretty much any people. Even being in different reigons and factions, they will have the same attacks and skills.  - Plenty of annoying bugs and things that could do with improvement.  I have had quests break multiple times, even once before causing me to have to start a whole new game.  When you disable an enemy in reckoning mode, your character will still try to target them.  And many more little issues...",1,0

"I have to say, I really wanted to like this game. I was under the impression that Reckoning was a 'sleeper' of sorts, even though I'm not a big fan of stylized graphics. While I started out feeling somewhat good about the game, it didn't take long to notice the lack of palpable, gut-sticking depth. When it came time to sit down and pick my poison for the night I had no desire to play this game.  Pros: Fun combat controls, excellent environs, plenty to do, quite a number of crafting options, solid animations, mostly polished, mix-matching of the 3 class types (warrior, rogue, wizard).  Cons: The stories/adventures/crafting lack a special something (heart?), no jumping/climbing, beautiful areas are often just for 'looks' and cannot be explored, small areas where the game just wasn't fleshed out (like reading books, managing inventory, and skill trees).  If you're looking for a light romp though a fantasy world and you're less concerned about depth and more interested in a relatively fun combat system and plenty of run-around, this is likely a good enough choice for you. If you're on the other side of the fence and you prefer options, a little more freedom, and a world to sink your teeth into you'll not find it here.",1,0

"If you're like me, you bought this game for console when it first came out on console (way before you had the money to be a pc). The multiplayer was fun and the cooperative elements of the game lead to grow mostalgia for it. Unfortunately, the game hasn't aged well. The multiplayer community is fairly small now given the game's age. This leaves it to be slower paced, as the hardcore fans have stayed to play hardcore game types. It's small size also renders less moderation. Thus, many of the multiplayer servers are flooded with modders. If you're not a modder, you're probably not going to enjoy yourself as much as you would if you had bought the game when it just came out. Also, splitscreen for Zombies and Co-op Campaign is fairly tricky to setup on a pc, unlike console. However, the game is still as gritty as you remeber it.",1,0

"It is painfully obvious that Kingdoms of Amalur was written as a console game. It is linear, handholding, simplistic, and devoid of inspired design. That it comes out of EA is no surprise either.  Graphics: 6/10  For a 2012 game, the graphics are mediocre. Bloom is used excessively outdoors to mask said mediocre graphics. Textures are not too bad, but there is a limited variety of them, giving a repetitive feeling to the game. There is a WoWish feeling to many of the graphics, which takes away a point for coat-tail riding... not to mention ugliness.  Sound: 6.75/10  Sound breakdown: ambient - 5, music - 6, voice acting - 9, game sounds (weapons, magic) - 7.  The ambience of a game, especially an RPG, is important. The sound ambience in KoA is rather bland and unmemorable. The music isnt much better, but not 'bad'. Game sounds are very... typical? Plain? The voice acting is quite good however. Essentially the whole voice cast of Dragon Age Origins has returned.  Gameplay: 2.65/10  Gameplay breakdown: Camera control - 0/10, quests - 2/10, combat - 4/10, magic - 4/10, NPC interactions - 5/10, environment interactions - 1/10, skill system - 3/10 ,crafting system - 2/10  There are several things that bring down this score for KoA for the PC, not the least of which is the **abysmal** camera design. Camera control is for all practical intents and purposes non-existent. You cannot even adjust the zoom distance! Coupled with the total lack of camera options, the cameras automated nature is atrociously programmed. Example: the moment combat begins, the camera immediately lowers its altitude from about neck level, to knee level.  Yes, it basically plants itself into the ground, and there is **nothing** you can do about it, except get out of combat by killing whatever is around you, or running away. Many times, you, the character, are actually removed from the screen entirely, and the camera points at nothing in particular!  I suspect this is because the camera is programmed to point at the 'center of gravity' so to speak, between and you mob of enemies. This becomes a major problem when say there are 4 enemies, and one of you, because the camera is going be pulled disproportionately towards the enemies position, but not all the way, so while pointing at the center of gravity of 5 equally weighted bodies, what you are left starring at is some random patch of grass or a rock wall.  Trust me... the camera is **BAD**, and it is a major stumbling block in attempting to have fun with this game. It just becomes more and more and more frustrating as you progress, and to my knowledge there is no fixing the cameras behavior.  The camera should never negatively impact gameplay... but KoAs does in a serious way.  On to other aspects of gameplay:   Quests were designed to be hand-holding baby quests. All the fun and adventure of QUESTING is completely removed, and quests in this game (and others) are not really quests at all. Quests are about discovery, mystery, intrigue, exploration, adventure, danger, etc.   What are called 'quests' in KoA are more like... boring. It basically comes down to, talk to NPC, follow your fully neurally integrated severely anachronistic GPS unit to the designated target, pick up and/or kill whatever, activate personal teleportation device to return to original NPC.  What do you even call that?  Combat is basically an exercise of stun locking. For those not aware, stun lock happens when it is possible to chain together multiple stun inducing attacks/effects back to back which have a recast/repeat/refresh interval that is less than the duration of the stun effect itself. Basically it means whoever hits first wins, no matter how much armor, HP, DPS, etc, anyone has.  Combat moves look flashy, explosive, bright, and fast, but somehow completely lack any feeling of depth. Its all superficial; for looks only, and it gets old, quick.  Magic is... tangential? I dunno... with the combat meta-game being solely about how you can stun lock your opponent (and its not difficult to split multiple opponents), magic isnt that much of a factor in anything. Spells are uninspired, and just meh in general.  NPC interaction: basically you can either talk to them, or kill them (or both). Lots of dialogue, which is good for immersion, but most of it feels irrelevant (all voiced very well though).  Environmental interaction: aside from opening doors... essentially none. Which is not acceptable for a game, especially an RPG game, circa 2012.  Skill system: There are 9 skills you can learn, each which have 10 levels. This is a low number of skills, but not in and of itself a bad thing. However, the skills themselves are uninspired, and are just... generic. You have your blacksmithing, your lock picking, your sagecrafting (gem/rune crafts that you stick into sockets), your persuassion, your stealth, etc. Its all very forgettable in the end; nothing stand out.  Also, you have a max of 40 levels to attain, and you start with 4 skills depending on your race, so youd think youd have a maximum of 44/90 skills, so youd better be careful what you choose, right?!  Nope.   You can actually get, without DLC, 89/90 skills. With DLC, all 90.  Stat system: There are no stats in KoA. Thats right. No strength, no dex, no wis or int, or anything.  Crafting system: Scrambling eggs is more complex than the crafting system in KoA (which I guess for the average console gamer, would put KoAs crafting system into the 'challenging' category).  Immersion: 2/10  It is painfully obvious that you are playing a game. From ridiculous weapon proportions, to the mysterious inability to jump, to the uncountably vast horde of invisible walls that restrict your movement, to the bizarre tendency for every single dungeon to be narrow passages that inevitably circle back to the entrance, the game world is not believable as a 'real' fantasy world that a person can lose themselves in.  Examples:   Weapons are of ludicrous size, which break immersion. Example: iron warhammer... youd think that at maximum, it might look like something like a 40 pound sledgehammer, which is a gigantic hammer that very few but the largest of large men could actually swing consistantly with power, and I mean actually swing, not just lift off the ground and bump it into things... well the iron warhammer in KoA, from what I can estimate, looks like its about 100 - 200 pounds in the handle, and 800 - 1000 pounds on the head... and a level 0 elf girl can swing it like its nothing. Literally, like it is not even there.  Invisible walls... everywhere.  No non-prescripted jumping.  Dungeons are circles.  Repetitive textures (although they are not of bad quality)... gives the feeling youre not actually going anywhere.  Linear progression of difficulty. Example: your first enemy outside of the starting dungeon is a bunch of wolves (how creative... because thats never been done before (better yet, your first enemy ever is a giant rat)). Those starting wolves are of the same size and build of every other wolf you will ever see in the game, and theyll all use the same tactics. But as you travel, the wolves in other parts of the world magically get stronger and stronger, and while they dont directly scale to your level, the designers did a pretty good job of approximating what level you would be when you reached a certain set of wolves and scaled their level accordingly to that approximation.  Basically it doesnt feel like you ever actually get more powerful.  Story: 4/10  Uninspired (that seems to be a theme KoA has going). Generic at best. Nothing in way of theme you havnt already heard before. Evil thing corrupts some king, king makes war, you are the risen messiah, go save the world as you are basically predetermined to do.    Final score: 4.28/10  I cannot recommend this game to any serious fan of RPGs who is on a PC.   You will be disappointed.",1,0

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

"Welcome to the world’s most fun over rated pile of ♥♥♥♥.   Since I first got a PC nearly 3 years ago all I have ever heard is counter strike, counter strike, counter strike. And, after about 15 hours of play time I see why.   Right away I can see that when counter strike came out it was the magnum opus of the fps/multiplayer genre and I can respect that but that also explains the largest problem with counter strike, its nonexistent learning curve. For the first maybe 3 hours I played on a few different servers and never killed a single person. I figured I’m new to this and it seems as thoe these guys/girls have been playing much longer than I have been so I began to brush it off and then 2 hours and may servers later I had killed maybe 6 people, not much had changed. And then remembered that that’s stupid, I shouldn’t be playing against people that have 150 hours clocked while I have 5.  Another problem is the weapons  I can understand the weird names, Valve would have been a smaller company then and saved a buck by naming them weird stuff but that doesn’t mean I won’t still make fun of them. The damaged ratio is also complete ♥♥♥♥♥. The sniper rifle is a one hit kill the subs are useless and I was once hit across the map with a shot gun blast. The knife is a bit under powered but Thats better than it being a light saber. And For some reason the only guns that are ever used are the AK look alike the M16 look alike and the sniper rifle.   I should say that counter strike is not a bad a game. It's for sure a sextillion times better than any Call of Duty ever made. And I will confess that this game is more fun giving your friends ADHD kid a gram of cocaine and telling him his dad is made of candy. But it’s also as frustrating as trying to put that same kid in a car seat. ",0,1

"I don't do the MP, so this is all about the SP. I put about 160 hours into this game on PC, completed all the missions multiple times on the highest difficulty, and have almost all the achievements. If I can do that, then better players like you will do great for sure. Overall, the game was not a waste of money, but it is sad to see a great franchise focus on the features I like least. I haven't bought a COD game since this one and based on watching other people play them, I am glad I didn't. If you want the best COD experience, COD4 or COD2 will serve you well. Never played COD3 since I don't own an Xbox or whatever console that was exclusive to.   If you liked COD: Modern Warfare, this game will appeal because it is pretty much the same game with lots of minor changes. It expands on the trends that set COD4 apart from the original WW2 shooters that COD was built on, expanding the special operations focus and focusing on bond-style villains weaving fancy plots to run the world in some way.   Technology also is greatly emphasized; COD4 was built on real weapons in wide use in the early 21st-century, while COD: MW2 makes commonplace what is rare or simply theorized even today. Most guns now have electronic sights instead of ironsights, automated weapon systems like sentry guns play a prominent role, and remarkably efficient UAVs with more firepower than a B52 menace the skies. If you want a more sci-fi than real-world experience of 'modern warfare' then you have found your game. Incidentally, the poor RPG7 rocketlauncher remains a big part of the battlefield and remains unable to hit anything more than 30 feet away without a huge dose of luck. So much for modernity!   If you like the classic 'common soldier fighting for his country' theme of the original COD series, you will be in for some, but not complete, disappointment.There are maps where average soldiers still fight average soldiers from other countries, but where they are fighting often requires considerable suspension of disbelief. What is clear is that COD: MW2 is continuing the trend of the franchise towards special ops missions where the real story revolves around elite special forces units who battle sinister evil geniuses weaving great conspiracies. Common soldiers like Paratrooper Martin and Sergeant Moody are very much passe. If you want Splintercell without the stealth mechanics, this will do something for you.   Like COD4, maps are tight enough to keep players from getting too lost and open enough, most of the time, to let players do more than simply charge straight into killzones. Some maps have tedious bottlenecks that will frustrate, so expect a few ragequits unless you are a masochist like me. So far, the grenade spam problem that makes many COD games very annoying is not too strong here; certainly not as bad as COD: World At War. You will have time to rest between rushes without too much fear of an endless rain of grenades appearing out of nowhere to punish you for your laziness. Infinite respawns are pretty reasonable in this game as well, so you aren't always going to lose for not having rushed after that last enemy getting shot.   One huge feature that greatly limits the appeal of this game for me: NO PC CONSOLE! COD consoles have always been fairly limited in their utility compared to games like Halflife, but for reasons that make no sense to me, IW has decided that players don't need consoles and so now players have no ablity to fine-tune their game settings, use cheats, or even fix some issues that could have been done in the past with five seconds of typing. This massively reduces the playability of the game for me. Before this game, I loved to see the beautiful animations and graphics in slow-motion. Can't do that here and that makes me sad.  ",1,0

"Don't know what to say about POSTAL 3.The story is ok...A pretty good soundtrack but the gameplay sux and is very repetitive: Pros: -Good story -Has some funny moments -You get to play as a cop XDDD Cons: -Full of bugs -Few weapons -Melee weapons are horrible in this game -Very repetitive -Some achievements won't unlock -Poor AI; I would only recommend this game if you are a hardcore fan of the postal series.On the other hand this game wasn't taken seriously by the game devs. they just thrown some ♥♥♥♥ togheter and called it Postal 3.But in the end it's not that bad if you manage to spent some time in it,don't forget it was made with Source Engine and has his good parts.In my opinion I'll give a 5.5/10.",1,0

"Take on the role of Alex Mercer, a man who has no recollection of what’s happened to him or why, or how he came to acquire the shape-shifting powers he now possesses. Find the people who’ve done that to you and make them pay. The game -action, adventure, open worldish- sounded fun and looked fun, and I was very hyped to play it. I was also very disappointed when I finally did. Controls, though a bit wonky, are not difficult. You can change your body “at will” to attack enemies and destroy things, and when I say “at will” I mean you only have so many things you can change into. I think the most fun aspect of the game is the fact that you can ‘consume’ random people and then turn into them, and run/jump your way around pretty freely.   I’d say the graphics are dated, but it’s an oldish game, so it gets a slight pass for that. What it doesn’t get a pass for, however, is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance. For a 2009 game that should run like a charm on my computer, it sure worked like crap even at the lowest settings, lagging worse than Assassin’s Creed III - and at least that one had a reason to lag (no “low” video settings, hey). I’m also not particularly fond of the reddish/orangeish filter they use on later cinematics and gameplay time, I find it bothersome to look at.   Your character is overpowered, which is not bad in itself if you like an easy game, but it does make things boring after a while as it’s all the same; to tell the truth, it reminded me a little of God Hand for some reason, only that one was actually fun to keep playing. With Prototype, I did the first few missions and was bored out of my mind - that along with the slightly eye-hurting graphics and slight, random spikes of lag made the game truly disappointing.  The gameplay is pretty repetitive otherwise. Fight a bunch of bad guys, have them call in tanks and an airstrike, be chased, shake them off, rinse and repeat with a moderate variety of enemies and mutants to fight against.   It’s not a completely unplayable game, mind you. If you’re extremely bored and want to play something that doesn’t pose a huge challenge, it’s not a bad game and could even be considered entertaining. I liked the city, the chance to explore it some, the general idea of the game was good (though the story was a bit hit and miss with me), but the execution left a lot to be desired.  Perhaps if the game had lagged a bit less I would have enjoyed it a bit better.  I wouldn’t recommend this game, but I would certainly not tell you to steer clear from it either, as I feel it could be a lot more fun if you can actually play it sans the lag.",1,0

"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.' Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway",1,0
"I had difficulty getting into this, especially after having playing Orcs Must Die 2 co-op with a friend. Many of the levels, it seems, require you to run back and forth between two different entrances. In co-op this works marvelously (10 of the original maps can be played in the second title in the series), as each player can hold an entrance, calling the other when things get hairy. The number of weapons and traps is also less than the second game. Perhaps this is an unfair criticism, but at the very least, perhaps this review will be helpful to others who are tempted to visit the first game after trying the sequel.",1,0

"Gather 'round, kiddies, uncle Nax is going to take you back in time! From the throbbing peal of EA's branding to the steely sparkle trailing around the logo, Kingdoms of Amalur wastes no time in dating itself. By the time the game boots, you'll feel like you've jumped straight back into the golden days of 2006 as EA prompts you to create some account with them in glorious 1024x768 default resolution. You'll navigate treacherous options menus the likes of which have never even heard the words 'PC Port' before. You'll set the game difficulty to 'hard' and wonder if it makes a lick of a difference as you sleep through the tutorial. Your screen will whizz around in every direction at the barest nudging of the mouse!  -cue gory introduction cutscene to earn your M ESRB rating-  Behold! Graphics as 2004 intended them to- err, hold on a sec. Graphics as 2012 intended them to look! Your eyes will water and gleam with delight as upon your screen plays out visuals the likes of which early World of Warcraft could only aspire to possess (and probably achieved by Burning Crusade, I don't know, uncle Nax never got hooked on that WoW stuff, no siree). Your soft, gooey, colorful character springs out of a mound of corpses like some necrotic phoenix, ready to bop, slash, level, traverse custcene wheels (thanks, Mass Effect), and slog through menus as the RPG gods intended. Your Oblivion-playing friends are gonna be so jealous!  From simply turning your camera to navigating your inventory (and I get the feeling you'll be doing both of these things a lot), everything is designed with a controller in mind. Wanna grab that loot on the ground? F to interact, but left click 'take all' or no dice. Pop open your inventory with the I key, then click around to get to your gear submenus. Wanna don that sword? Better left click then push enter, or right click and choose 'equip.' Just clicking stuff won't do, that's too complicated!   Walk with me now, back, back. We'll step into an era with invisible walls and tight corridors, to keep the player engaged and never you mind that wooden slope that clips into the rocks and which is inexplicably uncrossable. You'll pull a lever which dumps a corpse into an incinerator, which will then thump endlessly in there until you walk away. Why's it there? Immersion! Will you see something like this again? Nope!  Walk with me, walk further back. Further back? Yes, brave reader, we're braving the nineties and before! From the first few glimpses of action, we are beset by features etched far into the history of games and television alike!  Stock sounds!  Marvel, as the giant rats you encounter make -that one pig squealing sound- that you've heard a thousand times before! Behold, as the magic IEDs the immortal elves plant on some pillars explode with -that explosion sound- that you've heard from 1994 Doom's rocket launcher! Truly, we are living in the future.  We go any further back, and Uncle Naxza's gonna have to get unborn, so we'll stop here.  To put it simply, Amalur looks and acts dated from the word 'go.' It's an obvious, poorly-done PC port of a game made combining just about every generic RPG gameplay element of the past ten years, taking strong inspiration from modern MMOs and Bethesda titles. Areas are linear (even after you get out of the tutorial location) and lack any immediate distinction. You are pretty much 'the chosen one' living out your power fantasy of ripping up bandits and glorks and whatever else as you walk from idle NPC to idle NPC, waiting with punctuation marks above their heads for some brave hero to solve whatever ailment. The enemy AI is trifling (take four guys that stare at you and bob around while one of them winds up an attack, or bum rush the guy ahead of you while he makes threatening gestures for eight seconds), which makes even 'hard' difficulty feel like 'laughable' difficulty if you've ever played an RPG before.   And then there's the stock sounds. Call me a stickler for soundwork (and the music seems okay, if you excuse the predictably percussive battle drum music), but I lose faith in a title very quickly when it starts using stock sounds. I don't know, it's lazy. We've heard these sounds before, and if you're trying to make something new, or different, or stand out, using sounds that we've all heard before isn't the way to do it! I'm sure soundwork is expensive, and you don't need unique sounds for every facet of a game, but I don't know, maybe the sounds that don't feature in every cheap action flick/TV drama.  Harsh? Yeah. Premature? Maybe a little, I only have an hour and a half playtime at this point. First impression? Strongly made. Not good.  Buy the game? No. Buy the game on sale? Maybe if you're out of other RPGs to play (is that possible?) or you've never really played a third person RPG before.",1,0

"You are 14 years old, first time trying to play something multiplayer and online. You see this game, since you have a potatoe PC you start to play this game. Runs smoothly on 53 FPS, woow sounds are great, look an AK-47 but name CV-47 you play it you shoot, you get killed asking yourself how you didn't kill him cause you shot 27 bullets on that guy and he still is alive. You play it over and over, finally getting your first kill. (cause the enemy was coruching and looking the other way and you instantly kill him running 17 bullets spent) you get high hopes, I can play this game it is so easy. You get more kills, you get greedy you rush alone you get killed when you even thought about rushing by an AWP on mid. Ages pass, poeple pass, kills get comon. You start to play better, after 2 years you learn the recoils you learn the hidding spots, you know what is the enemy's next move. You practise your awp then. You play DM and DM only with an awp, your kills are slick, and your flicks are quick and accurate. Admin invites you to his clan. FIrst time you play this game with somenone for serious. You can't do anything cause you are not used to an opposite player to play smartly and you get owned, you don't do kills and your teammates question your skill. Couple more months pass you learn your duties as a teammate. You give info you cover you open. Clan gets closed down, you find another clan you are one of the best players. You play more switch clans for better ones. You get to LANs you get scared of the all expecations and so many eyes on you. You tilt and miss your shots, months pass, you get better, you become a man of steel and high nervous, 2000 hours pass you are finally a great player. 10 000 hours pass, you win LANs you play against better players, you try a gainst payed players you are toe-to-toe with them but you loose cause your team isn't on that level and they get scared. 20 000 hours pass game is dying and so is your love for this game. But no one can pay thoose voice chats from 8 P.M till 6 A.M every weekend with your friends. So much hours in this game and you acomplished nothing. You play against your local teams you get banned cause they don't expect somene to play that good without cheats and you stop playing this cause cheaters take over, very 12 year old first downloads a cheat then this game. You get mentally tortured cause the kid is telling you how bad you are and that you suck, you cry inside. Thinking what happened to me, how come this kid plays better then me, then you figure out the cheats are great, but you still play it fairly. You cry cause no one cares for e-sports in your country and no one wants to pay you for playing games. Your parents tell you you don't have a life you loose some friends, you loose your girlfriend you stop being active in sports. YOu just play this game hoping to be recognised, but you don't so to help everyone in this world after 30 000 hours on this game, don't play it it is a sinking ship and it is pulling you down. Tears are in my eyes for all the time I was good but now you can't play a normal match since cheaters will destory you... run READER, move away, press back and never turn back on this game..",1,0

"In 2007, CoD:MW (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare) was released into a community that has a seemingly insatiable lust for more shooter action. They weren't just given another shooter, they were given a game that really pushed the genre considerably. Amazing single player campaign and adrenaline-pumped, fast-paced multiplayer action with perks and weapon sets set the new standard on how these FPS's are done. It left it's mark on gaming as a whole, so a sequel was inevitable and gamers couldn't wait. In fact - according to an eye-witness who works at my local Game Stop - MW2 '...became the best-selling game in history before it was even released', all being pre-orders (of course, #1 sellers are subject to change). Imagine their dissapointment when they got this...  Plot 1/10  ..was so convoluted, I can't tell you what it was. Everybody wants everybody dead except the protagonists, and the only solution is...killing everybody. It's a movie written by Michael Bay. That's all I have to say about the plot without spoiling it. If you don't care (which you shouldn't), highlight this big, black box.    You meet Soap in the third-person, but it's so akward and out of his character to hear him talk. Then when you get back to playing as him, he stops talking again. For the main character of the first game being linked into the second game, he's just so seemed; so tacked-on and uninteresting. All the characters from the last game are 'magically' back too, despite being shot in the back of the head with Desert Eagles. Captain Price is back, but his acting and dialogue couldn't be more out of character. He went from rough, clever, and a cold sense of humor, to this...My Little Pony....thing. He's overly polite with no backbone. Imagine Mufasa suddenly with the mentality of Patrick Star, and you're not far off. Further, everytime I hopped onto an escape vehicle, I knew someone was going to shoot me because it happens like 4 times. When General Shepard reveals himself as the bad guy, it wasn't exciting. It was met with a loud YAAAWN. The twist is where the game's story slips into a void like a balloon into a hurricane. The player also 'dies' too much. Not in gameplay, but more like a scripted event/cutscene thing. Once again, *yawn*. The only intriguing part is when the EMP wipes out most of America's power. You and your team navigate a deathly-silent ghost town. It's eerie and very realistic; the best part of the game.    The ending also plays out like every other cutscene in the game: 'Good job, now let's carry you off and tell you who the kill nex-' CREDITS; THAR'LL BE A SEEQUEL!  Graphics/Sound 8/10  I'll put these in the same category because I don't have much to say about them. MW2's sound and visuals are everything we expect from the series: excellent. The guns, the dust, the lighting, character models are all beautiful, and guns, tanks, explosions all sound great, too; so why an 8/10? Attentive gamers will notice that a majority of this game's voice cast is from Mass Effect. In fact, several things were just 'taken' from Mass Effect. For one thing, your CO's voice is the voice of Captain Anderson, and the voice of the general is the voice of Admiral Hackett. Oh, and the general's name? Sheperd. There's nothing wrong with being inspired, but I call this a lazy, rip off. Infinity Ward wasn't even trying. Maybe I'm just being picky, but this really rubbed me wrong despite Keith David's long career as voice actor for military-esque media.  Gameplay 5/10  Finally, gamers are starting to see the light with the release of CoD:Ghosts. It's the same. Darn. Game. Same rail-shooter scenes, same set pieces, same 'set bomb and run away' scene, same door breaching scene, same, same, same. We've been playing the same game since the original Call of Duty in 2003 and before that with the Medal of Honor series. It's been 11 years of the same game. It's time for CoD to die. You run forward, you kill the next thing that moves, and steadily march to the credit roll. Everything about it is so banal; boring to the point of painful. The graphics and sounds aren't enough to mask the bad gameplay and story. A pretty package doesn't make the bad contents good. You've played CoD before. Enough said.  Multiplayer also went downhill with unbalanced weapons and killstreak abilities that broke the game entirely. When you get 3 kills in one life, you get a UAV that reveals all enemies on the radar. However, these streak rewards stacked with one another, so you use the UAV to get a few more kills, and get a chopper. The chopper automatically gets you 5 more kills giving you an AC-130 gunship. Use THAT for a few more kills, you get a nuke that ends the game instantly. Sounds pretty ambitious on pen and paper, but in game it means: first to a 3 kill streak WINS. Hackers also had their way with the game and Infinity Ward/Treyarch/Activision or all three refused to do anything about it. I've heard rumors that the same hacks that worked on MW2 also worked on MW3 and Black Ops. Watching this trend, I believe it.   If you want an example of customer service done RIGHT, let's ask Valve. Some time ago, Steam was glitching up and improperly banning players from accessing MW2. Gabe Newell wrote a personal apology to these gamers, and offered them a free copy of Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2). While that was generous and very polite, that might have been a bad idea for the poor people that play L4D2, because all the teenage @***holes from this game are now trolling the L4D2 community (as if that game wasn't bad enough.)  The Verdict  Visually, there's little to complain about. MW2 is very realistic by sight and by sound. Some of the settings are creepy with ash blotting out the sun and smoke rising from decimated vehicles and climbing corpses to escape combat. The whole world is going crazy, but they couldn't make the player care less. Traversing the beautiful world is an uphill hike to the credits. Yearly releases also means the community will be widely divided and chopped thinner and thinner with each release, so there's no point in trying to play MP. MW2 is big pass. Maybe get it for 5 bucks and beat it once. Final score: 3/10 Almost no reason to buy it.",1,0

I would recommend this but actvision seem to think that £1 = $1 so i recommend 1 of these 4 ways.   1. Waiting for it to go on sale on a website like  amazon.com  or any other website that doesn't use pounds this one would be the safest but you would be having to wait (or buy it off sale would still be cheaper).  2. Use a VPN this would be the more difficult one out of the 4 due to them being slow and finding one that you can use.  3. Get someone to buy if for you this is the way i did it but i would recommend getting a friend that you can trust to do it because get a some you don't know to do it they could easily take the money and run.  4. Buying it with TF2 keys this is be the best one out of the 4 IMO because people on trading websites like tf2outpost put trades up for it that use the price of it when its on sale (this only when the game is on sale)you also can buy TF2 keys for cheap from the community market its just finding some on outpost that is selling it for the sale price because of the websites crappy auto bump feature.  Its a shame because this is a very good game but i just cant recommend something that thinks that $1 = £1,1,0

"This game has problems, but it’s one of the best ones you’ll ever play. I have so many memories with this game on an Xbox, so I decided to get it here while it was on special. The game started on the first try, but it’s a hassle to find a legit multiplayer game. Zombies are fun as always, but you will not find a lot of multiplayer games so get yourself some friends or play it solo.   Pros: Mods Amazing Campaign Multiplayer Zombies  Cons:  Does not save my online multiplayer progress, so I’m always starting from private Random crashes Not much zombie’s servers Multiplayer is full with modded maps and some hard to find legit ones Bluescreens on my PC  Game will sometimes not even open and stay in a black screen  You’ll waste way more time trying to fix all of these problems than actually playing, so get ready to read some 7 year old forms and going to some outdated websites no one ever goes to anymore.  This is an awesome game, but its way too complicated on a PC. I’ll rather play it on a console to just keep it sweet and simple. ",1,0

"Originally developed as an MMORPG, Kingdoms of Amalur is sort of like playing a great online game on your own little private server.   The advantage of this is that you don't have to play the game with any MMORPG weirdos. So if RPGs are your go-to for immersion, nobody's going to mess with your little fantasy here.  The disadvantage is that, weird as other players can be, it's actually very depressing playing a game like this on your own, and it can feel a lot like you're marooned in some sort of MMORPG-version solipsistic nightmare with all NPC eyes on you. This is the sad secret behind every single player game, but developers usually go to great lengths to hide it.   In this game you will feel alone because in playing it, you are alone. You will travel and discover (frequently beautiful) new lands, defeat big monsters, talk to boring NPCs, and collect silly looking gear. You will do it alone, and you will feel alone. The world is open and everything is permitted because there's nobody around to care about you or your choices. Your victories will feel as hollow as your losses because ultimately they are.  Stripped of narrative weight and consequence to accomodate the MMO format, stripped of human consequence because 38 Studios died and we needed a single player game instead, Kingdoms of Amalur is a great 'could have been' that bears the burden of both single player loneliness and MMO repetition. A theme park that everybody either left, or nobody ever made it to. Truly depressing.",1,0

"Kingdoms of Amalur begins with an appealing, even charming veneer that quickly and dramatically tarnishes. At its best, it's a generic, 'safe' fantasy game more reminisicent of an MMO than a single player WRPG.  -------------------------------------------  Combat is broken down into the typical RPG trio of Warrior (Might), Rogue (Finesses), and Mage (Sorcery), or a Jack of All Trades, with the option to respec whenever you want, as often as you want. From the beginning to the end, Sorcery goes from significantly stronger to hilariously overpowered, and the classes ultimately play the same, the only difference being in what particle effects you throw at the enemy.  The game plays more like an MMO than a traditional single player RPG. You drift from zone to zone, awaiting the inevitable explosion of yellow exclamation points, and there are indeed many. Too many, as a matter of fact. While one can argue that this adds more gampeplay time, it's more padding than lengthening. There's no substance to any of them, and they all play out essentially the same. A random loot system adds another serious deficit. Fighting your way to the bottom of an ancient ruin, behind a hidden door you may find a few mushrooms and a healing potion, while looting a random household rewards you with the ancient Deathaxe of MurderLord. It's worth noting that this randomization applies to the Blacksmithing system too, in which you salvage items for parts (Which are also completely randomzied. Epic weapons are as likely to give you worthless parts as junk weapons)to craft new ones. In theory you should be able to create weapons better than what you'd find, but you'll more likely than not find trash parts, and anything you do craft will be beaten by something you find on the side of the road.  There's little to say about the system itself. It's a very simple click-based, skill-hotbar system of combat. It's not functionally bad, it's just not very interesting, and lacks any sort of depth. The game's Inventory system has to be one of the worst i've ever seen. Although there are attempts to provide organization, they are token. You are unable to sort your list-based inventory, which seems to organize itself completely at random. Items sharing the same set name may be dozens of slots away from each other. Also of note is a serious problem with many, many quest items that never lose their flagging, leaving them trapped in your inventory for the entire game. As they still take up space, this can be a serious issue. By the end of the game, over 50 of the 110 items in my inventory were quest flagged and unremoveable.   In terms of art and sound direction, again they hit every switch to be as generic and forgettable as possible, cycling through the usual array of fantasy zones and unenergetic voice acting. The game is rife with bugs and glitches, some of which can be gamebreaking, and many of which will impact your gaming experience in other ways, such as the above mentioned Inventory issue.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- If I had to sum up Amalur in 5 words, I'd only need to give you two. 'Generic. Pass.'",1,0

"---World The game world feels small, but there's plenty of side quests for people like me who shun main quests in RPGs. Despite all the action, the game is heavily lore-based. Amalur is a side quest lover's fantasy. It is a shame that the story is not particularly worth paying attention to.  ---Gameplay Save often (every 30 seconds or so) because the controls are clunky. If you see an attack coming, but the PC is already performing an action, good luck trying to cast cancel.   The fact that all mobs spawn in groups means that if you get hit once, chances are you'll become stun-locked. Hard difficulty may be easy for might and magic builds, but provide plenty of death knells for finesse/stealth builds. The stealth system is essentially broken. If you're in stealth mode, enemies are essentially deaf and blind as long as you aren't in their narrow FOV. Even so, if you fail to kill a mob with one stealth backstab, they tend to turn around and instantly take out a chunk of your HP. The worst part is, such backstabs do negligible damage to those mobs. The worst mobs to face are magic based. Enemy magic spells are particularly difficult to dodge since most lock on to your position. It is impossible to select which enemy to attack, which is often problematic. The worst in when Reckoning mode is activated and the player character keeps swinging at an enemy that is already down. Note that my play style always involves a lot of kiting and an extreme aversion to using potions. I suspect that the game is easy even on hard if you have a build with a ton of HP.  The camera angles are shoddy. In combat, you sometimes cannot see what is happening if you are stuck near a wall. Often I run in the wrong direction because the camera pans awkwardly or because I cannot see what is behind me (the camera locks onto enemies during combat).  There is no way to toggle always running despite the fact that there is no fatigue bar. This makes it difficult to put some distance between the PC and mobs when you're trying to kite. You have to start jogging and then mash the run key, hoping that your PC will eventually start running.   The invisible walls everywhere get really annoying quickly. If you get a destiny card that replaces dodge with blink, save often. There is no console, so if you blink and get stuck you will have to reload.  The best part of the game is that you can respec at just about any time as long as you have the money. It is really easy to make money in Amalur.  ---Visuals Amalur's brightness and overexposure lends to vivid scenery and a cartoony feel. It's jarring enough that you might want to consider using an ENB/SweetFX injector.  ---Audio The music is not very memorable or particularly immersive, but at least it does not play continuously. It follows the Elder Scrolls school of musical cues so you'll know when combat starts and ends if you have the music turned on.    ---Final Thoughts I wish more RPGs had a similar combat system, but with less delay between input and action. Amalur has some good ideas, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.",1,0

"I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that.",1,0

"I had this game on the PlayStation3 and it was kinda enjoyable. Ripping and tearing apart innocent citizens and soldiers alike, destroying everything, ellbow-slamming a tank - there will be gore and explosions everywhere. Sounds decent, right?  A little.  Only problem is the controls where a bit clunky (even on the PS3) and I had massive problems focussing and attacking the enemy I actually wanted. Another funbreaker is the fact that you're easily being bounced back, even by small and weak enemies. It's even worse when stronger enemies and helicopters chase you. Sometimes you're feeling like a ball in a pinball machine.  This game has so much potential and with proper implementation this propably would have been the best anti-aggression-game and there is. I mean, you have all those amazing powers! From disguise to running at super speed to hammerfists (lets you smash tanks), clawhands (rips and tears everything apart), whiplash (for taking down distant enemies), superjumping, semi-flying (gliding). You can even throw buses into helicopters and stuff, the list goes on and it's awesome.  But you're almost not able to live it up.  The story is ok and acceptable. The missions are way too hard and not fun at all (I'm not a good gamer, though). In one mission you have to flee. Excuse me? I'm a godlike creature and can destroy a tank with a single blow with my ellbow, why the heck should I flee?  That's boring and uninspiring. It's like getting a Lamborghini in a racing game and the game tells you to drive not faster than 30 miles per hour. Unfortunately, I didn't find any cheats or mods for this game. I think with a little effort like removing all the time based missions and the bouncing this would be just awesome.  If you can get this game for a decent price (it's under 10 dollars mostly, on Humble Bundle even cheaper) and if you do like gore, GO GET IT and happy ripping and tearing bodies apart for a while. I really hope you could do an devastator attack on some people out there who are wasting so much potential. It hurts, especially as a creative person.",1,0

"What can I say about Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 2.   Whenever I think of MW2, I think of bliss, I think of flying through the clouds without a care in the world, talking to our lord and saviour jesus.

The amount of cheaters is absolutley ridiculous, it outnumbers the cheaters in CSGO by 300:1, and that is saying something.

"Some basic tips for the Standard difficulty.  1) Do all the available side quests before advancing the main quests.  2) Do not mix Finesse and Magic trees unless you can find daggers equal to your level. They aren't nearly as common as they should be. Otherwise, you can't handle enough damage and don't kill things quickly enough.  3) Dodging is not as useful as the game claims for two reasons.  3a) Dodge doesn't give you any tactical positioning. In fact, most of the time you end up with your back to an opponent that's already turned to face you, so you end up repeat dodging just to get clear without getting it while they follow you.  3b) Certain bosses are too fast for dodging to be useful. Or they have AoE's that are too large to escape with a dodge. There's also fighting multiple opponents at once. They flank and they knock you off balance long enough to hit you again.  4) Amp your resistances up like your life depends on it. It does.  5) Load up on potions. Your life depends on these too.  If you leave any of these tips out, be prepared for frustration and loud cursing.  Oh, and don't count on the NPC's that sometimes accompany you to be useful. They're not. They can't deal damage worth sneezing at, and some of them spend more time rolling around than stabbing things.  Last Tip: The boss at the Hyperian is multi-stage. Be careful about using Fate Mode on him too early. This is the one that got me so frustrated I uninstalled the game.  Enjoy!",1,0

"'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.' A review by Richard Valkinsenn.  EDIT: My original review of Modern Warfare 2 has been updated to reflect my changed opinion of the game. I have a lot to say about it, and not a lot of it's good. The review is now broken up into two sections and will cover the game's campaign and multiplayer suites, respectively.  ---- CAMPAIGN REVIEW ----  Modern Warfare 2 is the pinnacle of the Call of Duty series, second only to it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. Unfortunately, factoring in both the game's single-player and multiplayer suites, that's not really saying much. Campaign-wise, admittedly, Modern Warfare 2's campaign does feature a thrilling, well-acted campaign, and comes packed with thrills and chills, the latter of which is mostly contained in the campaign's notorious 'No Russian' mission. While the campaign's level design is linear, thankfully the player is given a wide variety of roles throughout the game's runtime. One level will feature a tense series of firefights with loads of enemies while another will have the player moving stealthily in a semi-linear fashion from point A to point B. As for long-lasting appeal, somehow, Modern Warfare 2 has a charm that has withstood the test of time.  The campaign also features a co-op mode featuring missions based on scenarios seen not just in Modern Warfare 2 but also it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. These missions are widely varied and feature time attacks, stealth missions, and other various modes for up to two players to engage in. There are a few missions which require no less than two players, but thankfully, the majority of the missions can be completed solo, if players so desire.  Sadly, while the campaign and co-op modes are pretty solid, as far as a PC port goes, the entire package as a whole is found wanting. For starters, the game's options lack many essential PC features, like a Field of View (FOV) slider. In fact, it seems the developers went out of the way to make it difficult to even edit the native FOV via console or cfg edits. Not to mention the fact that the lack of separated audio sliders makes trying to tailor the game's audio experience to one's liking impossible. What makes it even worse is the lack of mod support, meaning basically that making custom content for the game is something that's just not gonna happen. Above all else, what makes it all even worse is the game's multiplayer suite, which only serves to highlight many of the game's glaring faults.  Campaign Verdict: I liked it.  ---- MULTIPLAYER REVIEW ----  Years ago, I played Modern Warfare 2 on Xbox LIVE and rather enjoyed it. However, having transitioned to the PC in the last several years and having played other, superior online titles, I've found Modern Warfare 2's PC multiplayer suite to be nothing short of a train wreck.  In addition to the glaring lack of an FOV slider, so much power and choice was taken out of the player's hands in this game. Dedicated servers, or at least a server browser for choosing matches is non-existent. Voting to kick or ban problematic players was left out. Mod support for custom content is gone. A much-needed feature like hiding the in-game chat log is just not there. And sure you could host a private match, but hosting a public match with custom rules and map rotations is a thing of the past. Well, unless you hack it in, but then you run the risk of getting hit with a Valve Anti-Cheat ban.  Then you get to the actual gameplay that Modern Warfare 2 has to offer... and it gets a little better and a lot worse from there. While MW2's maps are thankfully not as restrictive as later titles in the overall series, they still suffer from a near-complete lack of interactivity. Not everything about the maps is terrible, however, as they do allow for a multitude of different tactics and approaches, though this also applies to hiding spots and long, open stretches for campers to exploit. As far as the game's arsenal and perks go, there's a lot of room for mixing and matching to create a lot of different approaches and playstyles. At the same time, weapon customization is sadly hampered by the fact that only one attachment is allowed at a time, though a certain perk can allow up to two. However, adding this perk to a loadout means that no other perks in that perk's category can be applied.  Above all else, there's one thing that makes Modern Warfare 2 just about unbearable at any time, and it's an issue that also extends to the entire series, overall. A lot of the methods for getting kills in Modern Warfare 2 require little to no skill to employ. An example would be the addition of quick, one-hit knife kills that can be require little more than a button press, in addition to lethal traps that can be laid for other players. Several of the game's perks also exacerbate this, like a perk that expands the lethal radius for explosives or another that increases the distance over which knife kills apply. Not to mention the fact that the game doesn't treat fired shots like projectiles; once the sights are lined up, bullet hits are instantly guaranteed, no matter the distance.  Overall, while it has many high points, Modern Warfare 2 on the PC leaves way too much to be desired. A glaring lack of much-needed PC features along with an array of lackluster gameplay features sours an online and even offline experience with lots of untapped potential.  Multiplayer Verdict: It could've been much better.",1,0

"i have not played this one for i was always a fan of world at war and black ops. but this one was said to be the best before the third game. well truth is i can tell it used to be but not now. this game is infected with hackers, aimbots, map hackers, speed hackers, you name it and you can find it. oh did i mention that out of the constant 300+ people there most of them are hackers? ya see i can tell this cause of the severe landslide of 10th prestige level 70 players with prestige emblems/rank emblems you cant get unless you mod or hack or have a hacker give to you. i was level 24 when this happened but i joined a server via random matchmaking que and it put me in a server that was really laggy. then after about a minute a player on the console with a rainbow colored name said ' everyone gets level 70 ' then a loading bar popped up on my screen that looked like it was a campaign hud overlay for a mission done in campaign counting percents. well in my console it was telling me all my challenges were being completed one by one and one after another. i tried to leave the server but it had been too late. the hacker had made my once FAIR level 24 profile a level 70 profile with hacked emblems titles and such. being really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off as i was i refused to play for a day then said 'might as well just try to enjoy the game' well among servers like that and other exploits i was also thrown into countless matches where people were running mods such as changing the team names of navy seals and the spetsnaz to '♥♥♥♥♥' and '♥♥♥♥♥'s' as well as turning off everyones loadouts killstreaks knife button aim button and replaced grenades with throwing knives and forced to no scope with a intervention. then there was another server where one such hacker was calling every single kill streak reward in the game all at once within the first ten seconds of the match. another server i joined changed the map half way through. and to further prove my point. there is a server that someone is running labeled as a team death match server but its a team domination server. the host of such server is running a aimbot with a 50 cal and every time he takes a shot every lags. as well as he has turned off various loudouts and changed what is in them. i dont think this game is bad persay. but it is infested with hackers and Infinity ward and Valve's VAC service that is supposed to maintain the game is doing absolutly nothing about such problems. i would say get this game because its a good game in the series but unfortunately i wouldnt even look in its general direction unless its playing privately with a friend or two. ( if anyone will play it due to call of duty's reputation. i for one have only few people i know who play it on my friends list cause of the fad of people saying cod sucks cause it sucks nonsense) if anyone were to get this game i implore you to not even touch the multiplayer functions unless playing privitely with a friend. other than that this game is dead because of infinity wards abandonment of it as well as the VAC service being proved to be really useless in it.

"This game was the best one out there, but not anymore. (Because of the players online)  If you want to play Free For All or something like that, tough ♥♥♥♥ nobody plays that anymore.  If you want to play Zombies, you won't get very far at all, people play it, but all of them are stubborn, picky, pieces of ♥♥♥♥, if you do not meet their expectations you will be instantly kicked, or the host will end the session. Same goes with if you host a lobby, the same stubborn picky pieces of ♥♥♥♥♥ will leave immediately.  A thing I noticed is that if no one hacks in the lobby, the lobby will end because the hosts just want hacks, little 10 year olds only play the game to 'hack'  So basically the game is so dead to the point where people no longer want to play the game how it is, they want to play a modded version of it, and that if you don't hack, you're too low and you'll be kicked.

"Alliance of Valiant Arms is an example of a Pay2Win game. By spending an average amount, you get so much stuff, it will easily over-power anyone who has payed nothing. The sniper rifles are extremely cheap. When using a sniper rifle, once a shot is fired, you can switch to another weapon and then switch back by quickly hitting the q button twice, its like an OP DMR that can one shot anyone under any circumstances. It takes too much time to rank up, and you cannot purchase anything until Rank 8. This will have you stuck with default items for ages. And the ONE thing that made me quit this game is none other than the god forsaken time trails!!! They suck, they are impractical, and just ruins your day when all of your weapons suddenly dissapear. Otherwise, the game is decent in every other perspective. The graphics are nice, controls are smooth, maps and gamemodes are acceptable and even unique in some cases, like Escape (Though Zombie modes suck). Without those, the only thing it has running for it is that its not Combat Arms.",1,0

To summarize, I came away from this game the same way I came away from Skyrim, its alot of fun, until you do everything, the choices you make have no real consequence, and the world seems HUGE on the map, but the reality is, its just large open (or semi-closed) spaces with the same brands of monsters scattered throughout the world at large, there is a backstory, but your so caught up in everything, you dont see it, I recomend this game when its onsale (for like 10$) but otherwise 7/10",1,0

Back in the day I would have suggested this game. I spent crazy hours playing Multiplayer Online. It's such a shame that the PC version multiplayer is dead now. I hear that Xbox is still alive.

"The old iPhone game  Sword &amp; Poker 2  (NOT the awful freemium remake!) does everything right that Runespell does wrong.  In S&amp;P2, your spells directly affect the poker grid, which allows you to make better, deadlier poker hands. Which is fun. In Runespell, the spells do NOT let me affect the solitaire/poker game. They just let end it faster.  In S&amp;P2, you actually feel like you're playing (a weird variant of) poker. In Runespell, the game is much closer to Klondike solitaire. (Fairway Solitaire was fun, but this isn't.)  In S&amp;P2, the story is 'Go poker cute monsters to death to save the world... again' In Runespell, there's this ridiculous grimdark story because you fight everyone with solitaire and poker's UGLY child.  In S&amp;P2, you have incentive to not just defeat the enemy, but to do  well  - you only get a few healing potions per level, so the better you fight, the more health you'll have in the next battle. In Runespell, you heal fully between every fight so who cares as long as you win.",1,0

"First off, don't get fooled by my played hours, I've been playing it way before it was avaiable on steam but I didn't touch it since around 1.5 years. I would estimate that my played hours are somewhere around 3k, I've also participated in 2 tournaments. I would still love this game and recommend it to everyone and their grandma if Aeria wouldn't have messed up AVA like they did.  AVA was a great game back when ijji published it, it had great potential. The maps are great, nothing to complain about here. You could buy Weapons, Grenades and Armor for ingame money. You would get money relatively slow, but once you hit 50-60k € you could buy a decent, permanent weapon and that's pretty much all you needed. You also need money to repair that weapon and buy parts for your weapon that need to get replaced regularly. Getting 50-60k could take up to 1-2 months, depending on how much you played. You could still spend real money on weapons in order to get them immediately. It still was not pay to win at all. The graphics were actually decent for a F2P game. You would encounter hackers from time to time, depending on whether there were any free hacks out there or not.  Ever since Aeria games took over things changed. Their biggest failure was the removal of permanent weapons, which ultimately made the game pay to win. You could only buy weapons for 30 days, then they expired. The price of a decent weapon was still around 50-60k, and I guess you already see that this is a huge problem. If you don't play 3-4 hours per day you won't be able to get 50-60k per month, that means you have to play with the standard weapons which are not entirely useless, but you would never beat someone who is on the same skill level as you with a standard weapon while he uses his expensive rifle. This also meant that old players will always have an advantage over new players, because they still have their permanent weapons.   The thing is, you may think that the publisher should have no influence on the content of the game, since they are only publishing, but not making it. Redduck is actually making the game, and they do so for several other regions such as Japan/China/Korea. All of those regions still have permanent weapons. In fact, Aeria denied to have anything to do with the change from permanent to timed weapons, but we actually contacted someone from Redduck who told us that they were against that change, but Aeria insisted.  The next point are hackers. Aeria implemented a new anti cheat engine that doesn't do its job at all. There were times where you would run into a hacker every 2-3 games. I can't tell you how it is in its current state tho, since I haven't played since quite some time.  By the way, Aeria introduced the 'Tiered Spender' where you would get additional rewards depending on how much money you spend on their game. That's a nice concept, but the thing is that many of those additional rewards are permanent weapons, which is another aspect that makes it pay to win. Just to give you an idea on what you have to spend for a permanent weapon: In one of those tiered spenders you would get a permanent weapon starting at 7999 AP(a little more than 60€) and ending at 29999 AP(around 210€).  This is coming from someone who sometimes played this game all day long, played 2 tournaments and even made a few videos, my best montage got around 2k views, my overall best AVA video has around 10k views. If you have LOTS of money and can live with the fact that this game is pay to win then by all means, get it. I've been putting a decent amount of money into this game myself, and I would never do it again. Money still doesn't buy you skill, but it surely gives you an huge advantage. The next thing to consider are the hackers, everytime there are free hacks on a certain site AVA will be unplayable, and you might even get banned despite being a legitimate player (At one point hackers were able to use your name, which earned you lots of reports). And then I wish you good luck with Aerias automated support answers when you try to appeal a ban.  In the end it's up to you, but I can not recommend it in its current state.   *UPDATE*  I still play a round or two every few months, and I was positively surprised when I played yesterday. Permanent guns are back, but they are really expensive and it surely will take you quite some time until you have enough money for a good gun. I think they need to either make the weapons cheaper, or give you the option to try them out for free before you buy them permanently. It now feels a lot like back in the days when I still used to play this game all day long, but it still has a few pay to win elements. You are still not going to be able to beat a good player if you are average and spend a lot of money, but it's harder for beginners to get into the game, because it will take lots of time until you found the right gun, can afford it, and got enough money to buy armor as well. So it's not pay to win in the sense that bad players will defeat good players because they spent money, but good players who already have an advantage over new/bad players will have an even bigger advantage, so expect to have a hard time in the beginning if you plan on playing AVA.   If you are starting out I recommend you check out some guides because there are some things you should know that are not immediately obvious. Here is an (old) thread that's actually meant for players who want to play AVA competitively, but still is relevant and could give you some useful tips:  http://www.aeriagames.com/forums/en/viewtopic.php?t=1885997   Hackers are still around, but it's not as bad as it used to be. It is understandable that they can't prevent hacking, because they can only react to hacks after they have been released for the most part. They surely are doing things to stop hackers before they actually get to do any damage, we have XIGNCODE after all. It's similar to bugs and glitches, if you programming a game or program you are going to try to avoid bugs, but you can't eliminate every single bug before they actually occured. The best you can do is try to prevent them to your best ability, so there will be as few bugs as possible.  So, I still don't recommend this game, altho it got a lot better. AVA is on a good path right now and maybe I will one day be able to recommend it again. I even think I'm going to play it more regularly from now on. Maybe I will give AVA a positive review one day, but today is not that day.",1,0

"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the main game we point the finger at when we look at the negative aspects of Call of Duty, and rightfully so. Before I delve deeper, I would like to start out by addressing the controversy between Call of Duty and Battlefield. While I do prefer Battlefield, I do NOT despise the COD franchise. I had moderate enjoyment with Call of Duty 4, and a blast with Black Ops 2. However, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is easily my least favorite in the franchise. Without further ado, lets dive in.  What does Modern Warfare 2 do wrong? The first place is the campaign. While the story was decent in the game, it was a big disapointment. To no suprise, it is a linear corridoor shooter, as you mow up enemies and stop evil Russian men. Nothing new here, and there is no motivation to play the campaign. The only REAL motive I can think of is if you took alot of enjoyment in COD 4 campaign, and want to see what happens to your favorite characters in the franchise.   Next we have Spec Ops, which is a spectacular addition to the game. The minigames are superb in this game with great level design, and is a blast with friends. I took alot of enjoyment holding off enemies, mostly due to the replayabilty and freedom of this gamemode, in contrast to the Campaign, which forces you to put rockets on certain targets.   Finally we have the multiplayer, the heart and soul of the game. And let me tell you, is it horrid. This is not because the game is not 'realistic' enough - come on, we are in an arcade shooter. It is because mechanics are bad. Yes, they gel well, and the game doesn't feel clunky, but they are just flat out bad design choices. The first issue is create-a-class, which looks very dynamic at first, but essentially boils down to a handful of gun and attachment combos that are overpowered. This makes gunplay boil down not to skill, reaction time, or map knowledge - but who has the best overpowered gun. Same goes for perks and deathstreaks. I would have much more enjoyment in making a class, and finding a setup that suits my playstyle, in contrast to this game.The game also has no emphasis on teamwork, mostly due in part to killstreaks that cater completely towards racking up more kills. Not to mention, hacking in this game is horrid - but that is a whole 'nother story within itself.   To conclude, Spec Ops is not worth purchasing this game. While it is fun while it lasts, you will be forced into multiplayer, which is terrible. The games' mechanics only allow a handful of good classes, and that is the only way to do well in the game. Combined with a lack of emphasis on teamwork, the game becomes a muddled mess more than a competitive arcade shooter. If you want the best experience possible, I would highly reccomend picking up Black Ops 2, which fixes many of the problems addressed above.  ",1,0
"Put Oblivion, World of Warcraft, Fable and Diablo in a blender. Then fund that blender with the entire state budget of Rhode Island and have Todd McFarlane dribble concept art into it while RA Salvatore dances around chanting 'think of Drizzt, think of Drizzt, think of Drizzt' and Curt Schilling, MLB hall of fame runner-up, stares on from his golden throne, his fingertips idly playing across the seam on a long-forgotten mitt. Under his breath, he murmurs:  'King Arthur would've played shortstop. King Arthur...King Arthur. Hrm.'

"This game was piece of art when it first came out, so many improvements from Call of Duty 4. The campaign for Modern Warfare 2 was an absolute masterpiece, you continue on from Call of Duty 4, playing as different branches, with different characters, though this game does have it's moments being a bit repetative later on in the game but something new always pops up to give you a boost of interest, the graphics for this game are amazing, huge step up from COD4, the AI is improved but still has it's moments where it is completely unintelligent and has no regard for itself, animations are great, many weapons throughout the campaign to choose from, the singplayer earns a 9/10. As for the multiplayer I cannot say the same, let me start off saying that Modern Warfare 2 is only worth playing for it's singeplayer due to the fact that the multiplayer is full of hackers all day everyday, and you can risk being deranked in a specific server, that goes with saying you can be at risk for a VAC ban for claims of cheating, the multiplayer is nice and all, lot's of intense fighting, however the hackers are the main reason why multiplayer is ruined for this, so I do not recommend this game for it's multiplayer.",1,0

"Ok, I admit, I played this game back in my childhood on my original Xbox, and had so much fun. Not too long ago I reinstalled it for my computer, but when I did, I HATED it. I couldn't play right. People would one tap me from the side of the map, others will just be an absolute pro with the AWP making life so hard. Theres no mercy for new players, there's no official Valve servers, only the community servers which take away the classic feel. I have probably only joined 2 servers that have none of the stupid annoying Quake sounds. No 'double kill' or 'dominating' just classic CS 1.6. It was aggrovating for me, my favourite childhood game gone to waste, or so I thought. I was just bad at the game. I was scared to do anything. If I pushed in first, I thought I would get destroyed immediately. The guns felt weird and ridiculously inaccurate, the game didn't FEEL right, and anything I tried would ultimately fail. Well, until a couple of weeks ago.   I played violent. I played smart. I played gruesome and unforgiving. Getting 4 man spray downs and one-double tap headshots across the map. I was ruthless, relentless, and I enjoyed it. This game was starting to be fun for me, not as annoying, not as frustrating, only fun, as I always wanted it to be. The thing is I learned not to be scared, the same with CSGO. I played CSGO, sucked at it, played horribly until I just began to not care if I died. That was when I began to play better. CS 1.6 came, and I began to be horrifying. Enemy teams would scream at me, I would laugh and continue, their unfornate moments was fuel to my wrath, until, of course as it always happens, a pro AWPer comes towards me and 420 swagscopes me in the face. Rage quit.  11/10 would get Blazed it again.",0,1

"Make sure you like the core poker-styled game mechanic before you buy because that (and the nice presentation) carry the game. If you like the gameplay, this would be a good game for you. If you're unsure or not especially enthused, there are other games that might suit you better.  Took me a couple of tries to finish the game; I stopped playing and restarted a couple times because I got bored with the game mechanic or early grinding for silver.  Not a very long game once you learn how to properly win games. The story is really like a prelude to the 'real story' which is never revealed. The ending is pretty lackluster. As far as I can tell, there is no reason to Continue+ (for achievements, it's better to just not do the last stage so don't have to unlock all the map again).  Almost all allies are either impractical or unnecessary. Hrodbrokk is a pretty good source of damage for the RP/AP it takes; Brin is usually a waste of a turn because you should be better off moving cards around for bigger damage and using the RP elsewhere.",1,0

"A great game left to decompose.   As much as I enjoy playing this time to time, there are a few reasons why you shouldn't get into it. That's all up to you to decide however.  First, the good:  1. Fairly adult playerbase, I guess mainly because most are the original players from the day.  2. I haven't played Campaign in many years, in fact since I completed it, about 5 years ago, but I remember it was pretty good. 3. Fastpaced multiplayer action.  4. This game doesn't attempt at stealing all your freetime like some other games do, it's fun, but not addictive. 5. This works on Mac, I am not sure if other CoDs don't, but one of my friends recently bought this because it was Mac compatible.   Now the bad:  1. Hackers. It wasn't always nearly as bad as it is now. I am not sure how it works exactly, but InfinityWards seems to not have updated their anticheat system for a few years now and just about any lobby is permiated with a hacker as a result.  2. Unbalanced weapons. I'd guesstimate that 65% of all players use UMP, which is a clear sign your game isn't very well balanced. Some things like reloading on the Intervention has clearly been artificially slowed down, to balance stats out I guess, but still, it's not pretty and it stands out a country mile.   3. It's bloody expensive! I mean, this is 2015 we are living here and this came out in 2009 and it costs 20 USD, which isn't far off what it was at time of its release, I am thinking 7-10 USD maybe? I know it's CoD and CoDs must be expensive by law, but still... If you are going to have a 6 year old game still available for purchase, maybe make it more appealing by offering it at a lower price?  4. Playerbase is small, as You would expect, you'd have to work out the hours when most people come on, otherwise tough luck getting into a SnD when there's like one lobby hosted in the world.   5. Motherf***ing Kicktool! I am not quite sure where IW's common sense was when they allowed people to use that thing, my guess is that this supposed to let people rid of hackers, well no, usually it's used by a-holes to rid off people they cannot outskill. Very quite dissapointing.   I would pass on buying this if I were you, I am sure there are better options for your 20 USD.",1,0

"Originally developed as an MMORPG, Kingdoms of Amalur is sort of like playing a great online game on your own little private server.   The advantage of this is that you don't have to play the game with any MMORPG weirdos. So if RPGs are your go-to for immersion, nobody's going to mess with your little fantasy here.  The disadvantage is that, weird as other players can be, it's actually very depressing playing a game like this on your own, and it can feel a lot like you're marooned in some sort of MMORPG-version solipsistic nightmare with all NPC eyes on you. This is the sad secret behind every single player game, but developers usually go to great lengths to hide it.   In this game you will feel alone because in playing it, you are alone. You will travel and discover (frequently beautiful) new lands, defeat big monsters, talk to boring NPCs, and collect silly looking gear. You will do it alone, and you will feel alone. The world is open and everything is permitted because there's nobody around to care about you or your choices. Your victories will feel as hollow as your losses because ultimately they are.  Stripped of narrative weight and consequence to accomodate the MMO format, stripped of human consequence because 38 Studios died and we needed a single player game instead, Kingdoms of Amalur is a great 'could have been' that bears the burden of both single player loneliness and MMO repetition. A theme park that everybody either left, or nobody ever made it to. Truly depressing.",1,0
"I'm not going to claim that 'Postal 2' was a masterpiece of the art form. It wasn't. It was trashy, poorly coded, and its humour was more groan worthy than anything. But goddamit, it WAS fun in some sick, twisted way - particularly when aided by the 'A Week in Paradise' mod that expanded its variety and fixed a lot of its bugs, etc. It was a cathartic experience that let you indulge in a bit of depravity to let the stress flow by. 'Postal III' on the other hand, is a torture simulator at the players expense - not the NPCs. This game is abysmally bad. The hit detection is the worst I've ever experienced in a game, and even when you do hit there's no sense of tactile feedback. There is not a single weapon in this game, except perhaps the Badger, that is in any way satisfying to use. About the only praise I can give this game in ANY sense is that while the humour is still pretty rank, there are a few more genuinely good, surreal jokes that might hit low brow sensibilities. I actually did laugh once or twice when the joke wasn't 'Misogyny/gross stuff' etc. This is the most broken ♥♥♥ game I've ever seen released that took so long to make, this was in development as far back as 2004 and yet it feels like a proof of concept alpha - a proof of concept that in any true quality assurance workers mind, would not see as proving any viable concept at all. Its linear, broken, and practically unplayable. Say what you will about Postal 2 and its flaws - but at least everyone can agree that this one is legitimately pure ♥♥♥♥.",1,0

"Personal rating: 5/10 Replayability: Low Budget: If it's on sale and you like the franchise, buy it.  Lenght: Half a day.   Modern Warfare 2 takes everything that was good about Modern Warfare 1 and Black Ops 1 and slowly starts decomposing it.   Modern Warfare 1 and Black Ops 1 are both interesting games because of the story, but this half-♥♥♥♥♥ attempt to continue a story that really just isn't interesting or captivating anymore, is just... Tiring.   The gameplay hasn't changed, the graphics might be a little better, but in a game like this, you don't really have time to stop and admire the scenery anyway.   The game is extremely linear and you're left with a constant feeling of frustration from not being allowed to make any decisions ever, and basically being treated like a side-character in someone else's story.   If you've ever played pen&amp;paper roleplaying games, this is how it feels to play with a game-master who loves his own NPC's more than he cares to provide a good game experience for his players.   That said, if you can get it very cheap, it's moderately entertaining.",1,0

The story, voice acting, gameplay mechanics, and AI intelligence are all shoddy, so really you play this game through until you unlock all of your powers and then just rampage killing everyone for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles. Even then that can be boring because there's no variety in any enemies, situations, or scenery in the game.

If you need an RPG and are bored of anything Bethesda has out, then buy this to keep yourself entertained until a better game comes along. If you do play this, be sure to make multiple save files, like maybe one an hour. I have encountered several bugs that were very close to game-breaking(the Amalur wiki usually explains workarounds). Personally, I would have preferred another Bethesda(Elder Scrolls, Fallout series), or Bioware(Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights) game, but this game made nice filler until the next Dragon Age gets released.",1,0

"At first I was looking forward to some good old Disciples after the years, thinking there will be some innovative touch here and there. What awaited me, though, was one big unbalanced mess.   For one, interface and new approach to castles we already know and love were steps in the right direction. Also the new approach to the character upgrades with some minor boosts to troops pleasantly surprised me. On the other hand, the battle-system is maybe the most broken one I've encountered to date. I don't know if I somehow played it wrong (but considering I've read through tutorials and such, I think it wasn't my fault after all), but battles were just lenghty, repetitive chore. In every and each one of them you need to have one hell of luck on your side, because enemies are 'tough'. And the reason for quation marks is simple. I thought maybe I just chose bad enemies for the beginning of a map. Then I realized it's the same story with every enemy unit I attack, not only you have to pray so your troops actually hit something every now and then, but also you have to deal with the illusion of some strategy on that little Heroes rip-off action map. I understand that change is very important part in everything, but for the God's sake don't change that one kind of unique thing, which was perfectly functional, simple yet fun to play with.  To summarize it, I wouldn't recommend this to anybody, especially not to the Disciples fans. Good idea killed by totally non-functional battle-system.",1,0

"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the current iteration of Valve’s top-in-class competitive shooter, and the first to be maintained in the very modern way it has been. Learning from its experience with Team Fortress 2, Valve has a miniature economy in CS: GO that revolves entirely around gun decals. Players get a few ‘drops’ a week after matches, which can be a gun decal or a weapon crate – the latter of which cost £1.49 to unlock with a one-use key from the store. Obviously this economy is tailor-made, and so there are extraordinarily rare and mysteriously fantastic-looking gun and knife skins (with prices in the hundreds of pounds), then a large range of other skins tapering down to the common-as-muck variety that trades for pennies.  I don’t pay much attention to the CS: GO economy as a whole, though it’s interesting enough, but it’s important for a non-player to understand that a big chunk of the game’s audience takes it very seriously indeed. In the days after a new Operation launches countless forum threads are launched about the value of the new goods, whether someone should sell this new rare drop they got or hold it for a while, Twitch streams with giveaways and 50 crates being unlocked and so on. You get the picture.    I give such context on CS: GO’s economy because – even though it is a subsidiary part of the game to many including myself – it is the molten core of Operation Vanguard. CS: GO is a regularly-patched game but the major updates come in the form of Operations that introduce new maps and new skins, at the price of around £3 for an access pass – with the nice touch that maps are available to all players regardless, or made so shortly afterwards.  To give an exhaustive history of Operations would be no more useful than a general overview. If you play Counter-Strike then the chances are you play a lot of Counter-Strike. What the Operations do is freshen things up a bit – naturally they don’t disrupt the regular Dust-Mirage-Inferno cycle of competitive play, but you get some unfamiliar environments to tool about in, the chance to score some fancy new weapons, and in the context of a game you play almost daily, £3 a few times a year is chicken feed.  Operation Vanguard is different, and the changes are not for the better. The first problem I have with it is major: the way it’s sold seems to skirt the borderline of deception. To participate in Operation Breakout you bought an ‘All-Access Pass’ for £2.39. To participate in Operation Vanguard I bought an ‘Access Pass’ for £2.39. The difference is obvious side-by-side, but of course when OV popped up in Counter-Strike’s home menu I bought it more or less instantly, thinking this was the same thing.  OV’s selling point is two ‘campaigns,’ a series of missions with three branching paths. The missions are things like ‘Win 16 rounds on map X’ and ‘Kill 20 chickens in Deathmatch mode,’ and completing one bags a pre-determined award – either a weapon crate or a random weapon from a specified collection. So far, so OK. But in fact OV has two more campaigns, both of which cost £1.79 to access – which follow more or less the same pattern.    To be crystal-clear about this, the money is not the problem. I’m happy to pay for Operations, and OV’s combined total of around £6 in the context of the time I put into Counter-Strike is really not an issue. But that switch from ‘All-Access Pass’ to ‘Access Pass (with the right to buy more access)’, just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me right off.  First of all I felt conned. I bought the OV pass in the same way I’d bought all the previous Operation passes, expected it to be the same deal, and realised I’d been fooled by the removal of ‘All.’ Secondly, what the two ‘extra’ purchases offer is basically a re-skinned version of OV’s mission book. But thirdly, and this is the real killer, you’re encouraged to buy them to self-medicate the most egregious, enormous, climactically wrong and frankly offensive design decision in Vanguard.  There are multi-day cooldowns on missions. That’s right Rambo, you may have thought you were buying another set of missions and drops to liven up day-to-day business in CS: GO, but in fact Vanguard is a campaign designed to play out over a set period of time, with the only limiting factor a bald external one: cooldown timers.  Let me set the scene for you. I love Counter-Strike. I saw Vanguard was out on a Thursday, and cleared Friday night. Got in a few beers. Booted it up and bought the pass. I played the first mission, cleared it in about 15 minutes. Chose a second, the killing chickens one, and that was another 15 mins. So around half an hour into my evening of joy I was given a four-day cooldown for the next mission.    You can slice this any way you want, but it’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The sad thing is I get the thought process behind it. Consider: you’re Valve, in charge of a game where players (a) want new content but (b) put in so many hours that they’ll rush through anything almost instantly. For example, mission chains. Operation Breakout introduced missions in the form of random drops, which parcelled them out over time but had no larger arc. It was fine but the missions never felt… important. So Operation Vanguard’s missions are in structured patterns, with defined rewards, and are given the desired longevity through simple brute force of timing. You will not complete this content before we say so, because you can’t.  Oh, except that if you buy the extra mission packs, your cooldowns decrease across the board, because now you’re allowed to do more missions in a set period. That’s right. You’re basically paying to reduce cooldowns. In a Valve game.  The thing is that Operation Vanguard is only a ‘campaign’ in the same way that a pile of biscuits is ‘lunch.’ The missions are basic objectives like ‘Win 16 competitive rounds on Season’ or ‘Get 100 FAMAS kills in Deathmatch mode.’ And what do you get for completing them? Either a drop from an existing collection of guns, with a minor chance of a rare gun, or a weapon crate. The first is fair enough, but the second… I mean, at this point I already felt pretty rinsed by Operation Vanguard, and now it’s ‘rewarding’ me with crates that I need to pay more money to open.    There is a school of thought that says Valve has done this in order that a flood of new crates and mission rewards doesn’t flood the in-game economy, instead trickling them in over the coming months. To that argument the only appropriate response is – who cares? I play Counter-Strike: GO because it’s a great game, I don’t play it because of the economy, and while I accept the latter is how Valve makes money, the moment it starts intruding into the game – if indeed this explanation holds water – then the economy is not acting in the way that it should. That is, it should be improving the experience rather than throttling it.  The sad thing is that Operation Vanguard comes with my favourite selection of community maps yet, including two in Season and Back Alley that feel like potential classics. Yeah they’re all over the place in terms of favouring one side or the other, but this is par for the course with CS: GO and will be tweaked over the coming months. Every CS: GO operation freshens the game up with some new environments if nothing else, and the point of Operation Vanguard’s structure is to elongate this beyond a few days – to really showcase these excellent maps by forcing people to play on them semi-regularly for missions. It at least manages this.  I want to emphasise that I’m an enormous fan and c",1,0

"An okay tower defense game. Gets boring very quickly, but to be honest I really dislike the genre, hence why I might be prejudiced. If you like tower defenses, ignore my review, otherwise I recommend to pass on this one. It's just building traps and watching enemies walk into them and die. Sure, the game provides some challenge, but the gameplay itself is just setting up traps as quickly as possible and shooting some enemies from time to time.",1,0
"Now the thing to note with this review is that I am not complaining about the game. The game is fine, excellent, a real contender to the crap of Battlefield Play4free, but the only thing holding it back is the current licensee of the game, Aeria Games. Once upon a time, there was a company called Redduck, and they created a game called A.V.A. Now they licensed it as a free to play game under Ijji (for the US) and it revolutionized free to play games since it had PERMANENT WEAPONS. not once that timed out after some number of days, PERMANENT WEAPONS. Now, some games had this too, but AVA was different, you could get this permanent weapons for in game money, without ever having to pay a cent, (I was one of these users). In fact, while some would consider the game flopping with multitudes of free users, the game thrived, until Aeria Games noticed the competition and profits this game was making and decided to gain control of this mini-monopoly. While this went smooth at first, things started getting rough when Aeria started offering more and more items using its real money based currency-AP. At first, it was just skins, to make the existing guns look cooler, and no one had any complaints. But then, the game became unbalanced as the free users found themselves being outgunned by better weapons that one had to pay for. A new form of balance was needed, the switch to time weapons. However, while this might have balanced the game instead it ruined a once perfect game, for the OP (overpowered) AP gun were not timed (some were, but most weren't, at first), no, the igc (in-game-currency, the currency you get for playing the game) guns were timed, and soon, it was discovered they were nerfed (made weaker). One by one, the full time AVA players left, never to return again, today the game is in danger of being shut down. A dying FTP game, saving your money and play SF2 (Soldier Front 2). Its still living with events every week, and a growing fanbase, don't waste your time with AVA, under Aeria passes it on, fixes its issues, or worse, shuts the game down.  edit: this game has be ruined too much, there is no point in trying to start to play this game, only play if you are an older player who is returning, not a new player",1,0

It was beautiful. Now i sit here, and watch this CS:GO matches... So many people watch matches... But 90% watch them because of f***ing bet...  It will never be like sometimes...

"Initially this was a good game... no really- it was. I Mean who doesn't enjoy dropkicking helicopters to death in a 'free roam' environment. between a massive slew of unlockable powers and movement mechanics, some really stylish animation, and overall addictive gameplay- this game has a lot going for it. However, between a thin story (It could've been a lot better if there was just more character depth) and some maddeningly bad boss fights *cough* elizabeth green *cough* and the abysmel slew of bugs that invariably result in stunlocks and instant death- the latter parts of the game will probably leave you feeling like you should go play contra to unwind. for a game released in 2009 to have so many weird bugs is. well... not so great. Especially from a publishler like activision. Still the bugs arn't so bad as to completely ruin the game. All in all i'd give it a 6 out of 10. The animators did great, the graphics, for the time, are OK. (Would be better if not clearly aimed at consoles) the story and gameplay itself could be a little more solid. Still worth buying if you catch it on sale, but be prepared to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at a couple poorly designed boss fights, the ocassional unavoidable stunlock, enemies running around at mach 12, and the autotargetting system leaving you spinning in circles at 90mph.",1,0

"I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that.",1,0

"This game is obscenely huge. My guess is that it's about 3/4 size of vanilla WoW, and it kinda feels like wow. It has tons of dialogue and quests, all of which have voice over. It must have been very expensive to put this thing together.   Combat system is solid, you have to actively move around dodge or parry/block incoming attacks. There are 9 type of weapons and each type lets you perform different moves.  You can develope your character in 3 main ways (destinies). Warrior, rogue, mage or you can mix there 3 trees to your taste. But spending point in trees lets you unlock so called Twist of Fate cards which provide you additional bonuses, the more point you spent in one tree the better cards you unlock (capped at 109 points). There are cards for dualdestinies or even tripledestiny if you choose to distribute your point in all 3 trees, but point are limited so you may not have enough to get the highest tier abilities in trees. And if you build you character 'wrong' or you are bored by one playstile you can always visit a Fateweaver npc who will reset you pints, for a price.  Last but not least there is this  reckoning . It's basicly a god-mode you can activate when your  fate bar  is full, you gain fate in combat. Time slows down and you deal additional damage, your fate bar slowly drains. Whenever you defeat enemy in this mode you can perform spectacular finisher and thus gain up to 100% experince for every enemy you defeated before you chose to finish one.  It all sounds good right? Almost too good, and that is the problem. Due to game's sheer size there a high probability that you will get bored, sooner or later gameplay becomes stale. Also story isn't the best, it starts off with rpg's evergreen cliché, amnesia. And honestly in the end I wasn't paying much attention so I'm not entirely what was the deal with your protagonist.  I'm not saying that there are no player who would enjoy this game from start to finish, but I'm certainly not one of them. It took me several hour to get to it, then I had fun and 40 hours later it was getting more and more boring again and I rushed through last 2 regions (Klurikon &amp; Alabastra). This game has certaily it's value it's just not that fun to play for long. Maybe it's way too big.",1,0

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

"There are two seperate components to this game.  The single player is fast paced and action packed, but extremely linear. A few stealth sections are present, and are OK by FPS standards. It fulfills its purpose of teachingthe player the controls well enough to play the multiplayer.  The multiplayer is fun in theory, but several problems get in the way in practice.  No dedictated servers ensure near constant momentary lag.   The player base is not very mature, and there is a good number of cheaters.  The unbalanced perk system permits EXTREMELY unfair advantage.  There is no votekick option.  Waiting time in the lobby is quite long as there are many players who purchased the hilariously overpriced DLC map packs that you most likely do not have. The only way to get around this is to pay 90USD for a title that already has a sequel, which has only served to lower the player population.   If you really like the gameplay style, get Black Ops for the console.",1,0

"Yes, I loved this game it's awesome! It never gets damn boring! If you're so much into leveling as I am, you're gonna have much time spend on this game! BUT! Here's the ♥♥♥♥ing thing! There's a important reason why I write this TODAY! I've bought this game like one or two months ago! I enoyed it a lot til this day. Because when I joined a match today I stumbled into a hacked lobby, which is actually nothing in usual in cod as you may know, you just gently exit it... But today, I ♥♥♥♥IN GOT BANNED FOR JUST NOTHIN! It is just ♥♥♥♥in rediculous! I did not do one little rule breaking thing, and got punished for the 'crime' of another person! I even tried contacting the the staff, as adviced by steam... And this is what came out:    1 Message by you on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 6:53 As I today started steam and thought about playing a bit Modern Warfare 2 Online, everything was fine. I logged into steam, started the game and finally went into an Team-Deathmatch game. Then i quickly realized, it was a hacked lobby. Since it was some kind of Snipers-Only match. I then turned around and went out again. Then the strange things started. Firstly my name was, for non me known reason, completely dark blue, as if I'd have set it up in my Steam name, those color combinations I mean, which I did not! I thought then 'it might maybe be just an bug...', so I just started to look for another match, another TDM one. But this time, when I'm entered, I immediately got kicked out and left with the message 'Cheat detected.'. I was just shocked! Because I did nothing wrong! I was not hacking at all! I just accidently joined such a lobby! I even asked, before leaving, who was hacking in there. A player with the name 'Progster', or something like that, responded. So I tried another time to play a match and the exact same thing happened. Until that point my name was still blue. I decided to restart the game and see, if it may goes back to the nnormal state. And so it was. My name then turned white (or orange in the menus I mean), but the ban still existed!  So my question is, if you may could reset the ban and instead punish the right perpetrator. I did really nothing wrong and I was so happy when I finally got the game. I just can't believe that I got really banned... All this happened like half an hour ago. So I beg again for resetting this somehow happened ban. This has already happened to me in the past, but I did not got banned for accidently joining an hacked lobby...  Thank you very much. - Message by our staff on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 6:53 If you have been VAC Banned, the ban will not be removed.  For more information, please refer to our FAQs:  https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4044-QDHJ-5691  2 Message by you on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 6:54 But it was really not my fault! I wasn't hacking at all! Is there no possible way of checking this? 3 Message by you on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 7:05 So this is what I've read in your FAQ: Q: I am a legit player but I am afraid of getting banned?  A: It is extremely unlikely that VAC will make a mistake when banning someone. Even if this occurs you can simply contact Steam Support who will usually lift the ban if it was given wrongly. Again, this is extremely rare.   So please...    Now you see, they wont even keep their word. I don't even think they read what I wrote there! I bet it's just somekind of an auto message! Since it was posted immediately after i posted mine. How rude of them! Im gonna be patient until tomorrow... But still, for everyone who is about to spend money on this, to this day its a pretty high price for the game, keep in my this could happen to you, too!!! ive read through some threads as well. I dont think there is hope for my siuation, since those people never responded with something positive again...",1,0

"This game was piece of art when it first came out, so many improvements from Call of Duty 4.

As for the multiplayer I cannot say the same, let me start off saying that Modern Warfare 2 is only worth playing for it's singeplayer due to the fact that the multiplayer is full of hackers all day everyday, and you can risk being deranked in a specific server, that goes with saying you can be at risk for a VAC ban for claims of cheating, the multiplayer is nice and all, lot's of intense fighting, however the hackers are the main reason why multiplayer is ruined for this, so I do not recommend this game for it's multiplayer.",1,0

I had a bit of fun with Postal 2 back in the day so when Portal 3 promised me a honey badger as a weapon and a better camera for the game I threw my money at this once it was on sale. As I purchased and installed this game I found the free roaming atmosphere that left the world open in the previous game where choice was key to story progression had been replaced with a small linear map that pushed obnoxious cutscenes in our face with a voiceover that screams 'I'm trying to sound like Duke Nukem.' The worst part is that this game actually gave me herpes. As I played this game I found that my fingers started breaking out in blemishes which then spread to my arms. Before anything could spread further the honey badger jumped out of the screen and ripped out my jugular. With my last breath I write this review.

"This game is not bad. It does not anger me, disappoint me, or rub me the wrong way. It's just kinda there. The game plays like a cross between poker and solitaire. You see your stacks of cards (top card only per stack, like in solitaire), and you see the same for your opponent. You move cards around like in solitaire, stacking them on other cards, except you're trying to make combinations of five cards, which can be poker combos like flushes, straights, etc. You then use those to attack your enemy, and vice versa. You have bonus card thingies on the side of your screen that you can use to attack when you build up enough rage.  It's an okay premise, but it doesn't really seem to change and the story is just okay. It's one of the least compelling games I've played. I have nothing against this game, which is really saying something. I typically love or hate a game, but this one is just kinda meh. I wouldn't recomment paying more than a Steam sale price, by any means, but I'd recommend you play the demo if you're interested. The gameplay you experience in 20-30 minutes of that is pretty much the entirety of the gameplay from what I've seen thus far. It's not very exciting or interesting, and nothing draws me in to make me want to keep playing. It's an okay game, but that's it.",1,0

"This game is without a doubt an arcady first person shooter, just like Call of Duty is know to be. Simple mechanics, decent graphics, and semi accurate story (im not sure the characters in-game actually exsisted), and hey! The first Zombie mode (all WaW DLC maps included). Unfortunatly the ports to the pc arent always good and ive had multiple problems with this game since i bought it (2 years ago). for starters there are a few wierd problems with intel socket GPUs, i would not use it with them since there is a wierd slow down/ speed up when fps goes up and down like a yoyo (This might be different with the newer ones, since i used an intel HD 3000 with 6gb of 1333 sys ram. partly because the iris pro operates with a small amount of ESram, i suppose a ram upgrade would suffice.) But it seems to work with an FX 4100 with 8gb sys ram and a 2gb GTX 660 SC (super clocked).  Now last time i checked the multiplayer was almost empty, since the nature of call of duty is everybody moves to the next game and starts again. and MW2 was incredibly popular. So its hard to find a game online. Not to mention the majority are modded and i expect there are plenty of hackers waiting to prey on your patience, althought it would be completely usless for them.  Since this is the game that brought in the idea of zombie survival, there isnt much too it, compared to BO1/2. Border up windows get money kill zombies that get in, get money, buy new guns, kill more zombies. yadayadayda. Its the mode at its infancy and dont expect the full blown mode it is today.  In hindsight i would not have bought it. But hey! this is to help you guys/girls to decide.

"Counter-Strike, this one also known as Counter-Strike 1.6, is a team-based multiplayer realistical/military shooter. And a very well known one at that. It was first available as a free mod for Half-Life 1, being patched regulary up to version 1.6, until recently it got it's way onto Steam, as a serapately sold title.  So, how is the player base? Counter-strike 1.6, being popular self, has an active player base. You will see many servers, up to 32 players. At very least there are many Russian servers, as it had a cult following over there, can't really see past them. On bad side, most seems to prefer 'Terrorist plant C4' mode and then De_Dust2 is the most played map. A lot of servers run small mods, that may alter balance or other small things. And most of it, playerbase had a lot of time to play and master this game, so new players will be more frustated than having fun learning.  Counter-Strike is a very well known realistical FPS. It gained it's popularity while being free mod for popular Half-Life, because it provided something else what wasn't overused yet - realistical shootouts (using models of real weapons, you know) in team multiplayer. Unforgiving and furious. Or unbalanced and twitchy one-shot kills with headshots. Whichever one you prefer.   Counter-Strike has two types of map. First, 'de', is a mode where counter-terrorists have do defends few market spots on map from terrorist. One of the terrorists spawns with C4 in inventrory and has to bring it to one of the marked spots to plant it adn start to countdown of T's victory. Roles change as Terrorists will have now to defend this place from CTs, who's aim now are to defuse the bomb, in which case CTs will win the round, no matter how many more Ts are left. Pretty interesting mode and most played, otherwise this game would have been camping fest. And if one site is too well defended, Ts can go to another one. And then there is a second type, 'cs', in which CTs have to to rescue hostages by bringing them back to base. The problem there, is that hostage NPCs aren't perfect (though good enough) and since CTs have to rescue them all, Terrorist can camp in one of the spots around them, since CTs will have no choice but to come to win. Much less played and even if it does, it goes like your everyday Team Deathmatch, just killing all of opposite team. Much simpler anyway.  Now, the core gameplay... There are few rounds. Each round starts with each team spawning on their side of map. There is no respawning during round, once person is dead he is out, so you will have to worry much more about getting insta-killed. There are no items placed on map itself either (on correct, official maps), no kind of medikits. In spawn place, you have 15 seconds to press 'b' button (or whichever you set) to bring up 'buy menu', where you purchase weapons and equipment for the round witht he money that you earned so far. Yep, when round ends everybody gets some sum of money to spend, with winning team getting more, an ingenius design decision that helps losing team to get steamrolled even harder. What you can buy there is a pistol, primary weapon and any of the equipment. (Yep, if it doesn't smell like prototype of modern military shooters) Once past purchase screen, you are free to run and shoot. And here comes the art of recoil and aiming. For you see, one of the more important thing that is used in this game is accuaricy of your weapon. If you move it drops. if you jump, it drops. It drops while you are shooting too. Thus it becomes more importanly to get good position, making assaults more compilated, and you often have to relearn to shoot, making few clicks instead of just holding down mouse button. You will have to be often walking instead of running, to keep accuaricy while moving (it also makes you silent, so do it often), or just stand and crouch sometimes. Burst shooting is better there and for long range targets you want to be just click few times. Another important thing is that you can shoot through some walls with more powerful primary weapons. So don't be surprised for people shooting through door, walls and even just over the corner, it indeed does small damage to whoever is behind. The game also emphasises aiming because it supports headshots and they do a MASSIVE damage. And you also got three kinds of grenades. Explosive (HE), which explodes, good for throwing into chokepoints. Flashbang, which blinds whoever looked at it when it blows for few seconds, quite annoying but good for stroming into room. And Smoke Grenade, when you don't want enemies to see you coming and don't want to be under direct fire, good for open spaces with snipers (who instakill you when you peek around corner). Protip: You run slightly faster with knife out.  And well, while on theory it sounds interesting, as well as empashises teamwork. here comes the downfall of the game. The weapons, while make people with gun fetish happy, are badly balanced around each other. There are just best and bad weapons. From pistols Desert Eagle is the best, they behave as backup when you got no time to reload primary weapon. Shotguns are theorically good for close range but in this game they are useless and Assault Rifles can kill even better at close range. Sub-Machine Guns category had advantage of no accuaricy drops while moving, but are still inferior to Rifles. Rifles category has two best guns: all-range assault rifle like AK-47 and all-range sniper rifle like AWP (which doesn't even require headshot to one-hit kill), exactly what majority of people use. The only Machine Gun is 'pew pew pew can't hit'. And all-range is all-range, random is random. You may run and shoot in general direction of enemy and pull off a headshot from your AK-47 by luck. Or you may walk around corner, thinking of your next grandious tactical plan, just to get headshotted in insta-second by guy with sniper rifle from close range. It's just so full of cheap and frustating, the rage is probably the main thing that keeps players coming back for more, not honest fun, as well as luck of possibly pulling few magical headshots. Slow-down when being hit doesn't seem to be good idea either, making it harder to get away from the choke points. And random spread is not actually random, it just randomly follows one of the pre-set pattern. And yes, if you will learn them, you will be able to control your shooting better and get on top. Exactly what puts apart newbiews and elites, and exactly what elites seem to boast about when they want to say that Counter-Strike 1.6 is the best because it takes more skills and time to learn, with artifical challenges like this one that makes little sense. And well, once you spend your time to learn them, you will still find out on top that it didn't make the game any more amazing.  But you know, it's not too bad. It does teamwork well. Sometimes the game just works. When you work along the team, round the corners and storming the next room, where you follow teammates, supporting each other. Provide covering fire to the corner. When upon entering next place, each one covers his own direction, as some of the rooms just have too many places from which enemies can shoot you (smoke grenade and flashbangs help in these cases). And it's pretty damn nice at those moments, until they get ruined by something stupid, something you don't feel like could be prevented. Yea, getting shot by sniper.  And yes, this game has good enough sounds. No music, sadly. The graphics are quite HL1 high-definition era, but otherwise are fine enough. The levels are a bit of bland though.  Can't really recommend it. Because everybody who will like such games are already playing it. And player base of this game had too much time by now, that they will be just way too skilled for new players, who will just get destroyed and it will take a long time to get onto same level. It's not like there aren't enough military/realistical shooters anyway.",1,0

"Essentially a single-player RPG with the contents of a MMO-rpg (expect the social aspect)  Some of the games artwork can at times be appealing, but personally I prefer a somewhat more toned down and realistic style. In this game, the characters have overly sized hands and weapons etc all showered with all the brightest colours the designers could think of.  The game consist of a few faction quest lines, which at times can be interesting, but all too often quest are 'go to certain point, fetch/kill, and return). Real choicemaking is non-existent.  The main story line is bland and generic, even with the '10 000 years' of background history the develpoers brag about. Magic elves, technical dwarfes, in-between humans... . The lack of good voiceacting only contributes to the game's inability to immerse, with probably as few as 10 voice-actors trying to the best of their ability to voice all characters in the game.  The combat-system is quite nice. Quite easy, but a lot of ways for the player to adapt underway to the way they want to play. And unlike more classic RPGs all character developments can be changed for a small fee, so that the player don't have to think ahead. Nice, for some... . Almost all ingame quest-rewards and looting is scaled it seems, so the player seldom experience any sense of joy or positive surprise when overcoming obstacles. Many enemies are scaled too it seems.  Personally I had to stop playing this game after encountering a game-breaking bug (Her righteous fury-quest), of which there is no official fix to 4 years after release (due to the developers bankruptcy, I guess). Therefore I could not fully explore the main idea of this game - fate. I find the idea of fate troubling on a logical level, and the game as far as I played it, did only contribute to this with all its logical fallacies.  Nice enough game if you are looking for mind-numbing, button-mashing action-rpg, with little need for investment on the player's part. Stay clear (even on sale), if you are looking for immersion, challenge and a sense of accomplishment.   This game will suck the marrow out of your bones if you are a true RPG fan. 5/10",1,0

"I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that.",1,0

"Have you ever played an MMORPG and felt, 'oh gosh, I wish there was no once else but me and the NPC's around here'? Then this game is right up your alley. This game is right down to the core an offline MMORPG. You get tons of trash armor, there's something that reminds of dungeons, kill and fetch quests everywhere and as much action in the gameplay as you would expect of an MMORPG. While the overworld have some pretty places to look at, you rarely get much of a chance to do so since you spend most of your time inside somewhere.  Positive: + Combat is responsive when dodging and there's nice hit detection when hitting an enemy + The armor is the game looks good + Overworld is pretty and there's a lot to look at + If you dig deep there's can be some fun character builds  Negative: - Using shields in combat is absolutely unresponive and awful - The amount of trash equipment you get makes it a chore to find anything. You spend more time going through trash than you do comparing which weapon to use - Questing is VERY overwhelming in this game. You get quest, on quest, on quest, on quest. - Questing is completely uninspired. If you've ever played an MMORPG you probably have experience with the kinds of quest you get in this game. - They don't put much effort into getting you interested in the story, which is needed in this game since you get so many story side-quests. Sometimes you end up doing a quest and out nowhere find out it was apparently a huge part to the main story, but unless you're really reading and listening to every single NPC on the way you won't get anything from it. - I played over 10 hours and not a single hint of a mount of any kind. Wouldn't even be a little surprised if at least 5 hours of my gameplay time has been just running from dungeon to dungeon and city to city just to get filled with quests. Some cities only exists to give you quests. - Overworld, while pretty, feels very empty. You get the feeling of playing a dead MMORPG everywhere and it just stops the world from feeling alive at all.  With all of this said, you might find some enjoyment if you really enjoy making original character builds and mess around with that. But if you're anything like me and just enjoy some classic warrior action this game is going to bore you to tears and you're better off with Guild Wars 2, which actually is an MMORPG with an alive world and have fluid combat as well.  Only buy this game if you're starving for some wRPG action.",1,0

"I'm going to try to write a review that's a little bit more descriptive than the other ones.   AVA is fairly very old game. On high graphics, it looks amazing, albeit, not as good as today's fps games' graphics. The gameplay is fast paced and it feels really good. It was one of the best f2p mmofps's out there. It was even better than some paid fps games. There's a reason as to why I say, 'was one of the best.' That's because everything about this game went to the dumps when ijji handed it over to Aeria Games. Sure, gameplay is relatively the same, but it's just not worth playing anymore. Aeria Games decided to remove one of the best features, permanent guns. If you're bounced around between f2p mmofps games, then you know that permanent guns is a very attractive feature. Permanent guns was one of the reasons that I settled with this game. Next, they decided to make the game pay to win. The only permanent guns that you have are the starter weapons. You need to maintain and repair them by paying with the game's currency. But an update greatly increased the repair prices. In order to maintain your all your guns and still make a profit, you need to play for around 6 hours each day. And those 6 hours aren't even going to pay for the guns that you want to buy. Those are expensive, and they disapear after a month! They made these changes to give players more incentive to play, but in reality, this game has become a chore.  I can no longer recommend this game to anyone because it's not good anymore.",1,0

"Advantages: a good idea, an opportunity to play on a network Disadvantages: poor performance, graphics, textures, defects. Collection of my reviews on video games continues. Today we will speak about the most famous first-person shooter 'Counter-Strike'.  Igrushechki this appeared quite a long time, already in the year 2000 and won the gamers. Then all these 'shooters' were a novelty, and of course all like this game. I knew about it a long time, I heard enthusiastic talks about it, heard the word 'bots', 'contra', 'headshot of', 'ks'. And what is it, I managed to learn five or six years ago. Games then I was not 'tempted', but even then I have appreciated this game for three and a minus. Why? I'll explain later. Now the whole of the game. Created her notorious guys with the short name 'Valve'. About 'Valve's' I will say this: all of their games on the subject stopped 'fantasy' and 'half-real.' And this game belongs to the second category.  So, the creators of the idea is quite tempting. Confrontation of the law against terrorists. They gave the game the proud name of 'Counter-Strike', ie 'counter-attack', but that's just shock, as such, no intrigue in this game. And that is? There are running with a gun, a gun, a knife. Oh yes, there is another grenade (use 0). And you can take the shield (not a bad thing). We can play for the 'special forces' (which I did) and terror (very few people want). Most probably the main thing here is that we can play a 'bot' that is, our friends runs the computer, the computer runs our enemies, but we can play and through the network, where all have real people. Play over the Internet more interesting, but still 'stupid'.  I do not want to talk about any reality or fiction, but all I will say. I have not seen, not in movies, not in life, to special forces, and the terrorists jumped as the 'hare', climbed the stairs, as if running on the ground. And finally, it is that even the slightest preparation is absent, the men can not hit no shield, no weapons, no arms / legs. The hostages, but here too there are, behave calmly, stand, no one is afraid of fear or cry.  So, I criticized a little, and now tell you about the features. Game modes are different, rescuing hostages, rescue VIP-a, defusing a bomb, knife, grenade. A quest we give money, we buy ourselves, that it is necessary, for example, body armor (a rare case when it is not worn in advance on fighter (in reality)). On the job, we allocated time, which is usually enough. Each of the men says that he wants and commands that it is possible to give no one is listening. By the way, there you can sprinkle a logo that can be selected in advance. Beauty is not gaining.",0,1

"Counter-Strike is a tactical first-person shooter video game which originated from a Half-Life modification and features real-world weapons.  Counter-Strike pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing the mission objective or eliminating the opposing force. The game has both individual and multiplayer options. Bots can be added into the game. The online-multiplayer option is activated via Steam.  Other than similarities in basic gameplay, Counter-Strike is not in any way related to Half-Life. The original version was marketed as a commercial mod, but since then it has grown into a separate game in itself.",0,1

"**** TL;DR ALOT OF HACKERS INFINITY WARD/VALVE DONT CARE ANYMORE**** **** ALMOST EVERYTHING IS 'OP' IN THIS GAME THATS HOW IT WAS BALANCED****  Probably my favorite call of duty and ive been playing since launch, but there are ALOT of hackers these days and there are also people that spam grenade launchers all day, and there are people that will DDOS or kick you if they dont like you or you make them mad. It feels like every 3/10 games has a hacker on a GOOD day and it seems to get worse whenever there is a holiday (the kids are off school).Ive had entire nights of trying to play this game and every lobby has a blatent aim botter/wall hacks so i just have to play something else.Why do people hack in a old game like this?  The only time to buy this game in my opinion is when it is at 50% off MINIMUM but i have never seen it go lower than that  so you need to ask yourself: can i deal with hackers,grenade launchers,and possibly modded lobbys all day?  if yes get the game while its on sale and try to enjoy whats left of the game  if no then just skip it and just enjoy the memories of what the game used to be like and go watch a twich stream Kappa  I can not recommend the game in the state that it is in now",1,0

"So i did some research and found that this game crashes if you enable interlacing, which is something that has to do with your gpu and how it streams its data that almost every modern gpu uses by default, which has to be changed in the B.I.O.S. Which makes it confusing how I managed to play about a half an hour of this before it crashed in game, and loading a save only made it crash again during the loading screen, and the community seems to not have a fix for it. Starting a new game also didn't work in case you didn't think I tried. Downvoting until i hear it's fixed, odds are with a game this old now it will never happen. Really fun though, controller pretty much necessary.  Edit: So I looked at this review and realized that I pretty much didn't cover any of the game I actually played, so in short, it has some decent puzzle elements, like stopping a fan blade over a death pit and walking across per say, or walking up to a dude, taking his gun and punching him in the face. You would not believe how much fun that is until you try it. I've played through most of the game on my friends ps3, which is why I picked it up, however I'm still dissapointed that there isn't a solution for my problem no matter how hard I look, considering my BIOS is apparently crap and I don't have interlacing options. This is a good game, and I reccomend picking it up, just not on PC, I hate to say it.",1,0

"Initially this was a good game... no really- it was. I Mean who doesn't enjoy dropkicking helicopters to death in a 'free roam' environment. between a massive slew of unlockable powers and movement mechanics, some really stylish animation, and overall addictive gameplay- this game has a lot going for it. However, between a thin story (It could've been a lot better if there was just more character depth) and some maddeningly bad boss fights *cough* elizabeth green *cough* and the abysmel slew of bugs that invariably result in stunlocks and instant death- the latter parts of the game will probably leave you feeling like you should go play contra to unwind. for a game released in 2009 to have so many weird bugs is. well... not so great. Especially from a publishler like activision. Still the bugs arn't so bad as to completely ruin the game. All in all i'd give it a 6 out of 10. The animators did great, the graphics, for the time, are OK. (Would be better if not clearly aimed at consoles) the story and gameplay itself could be a little more solid. Still worth buying if you catch it on sale, but be prepared to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at a couple poorly designed boss fights, the ocassional unavoidable stunlock, enemies running around at mach 12, and the autotargetting system leaving you spinning in circles at 90mph.",1,0

"This is an alright game. The story is interesting and the mechanics are kind of fun. The game offers over 100 hours of adventuring fun. The skills allow you to fully customize your character into three different skill trees and get special bonuses depending on how you do it. You can also respec as many times as you like(with ample coin).  However, this game has some glaring problems. For one, the game is plagued by copious bugs. It is very frustrating to have to reload the game once or twice an hour because you get stuck in a loading screen, or stuck in the floor, or because the game just feels like randomly crashing. The game also has a strange and clunky cheap feeling to it. The cities are filled with guards who have strange psychic powers and can sense wrong doing from half a mile away. You're allowed to play good or evil and make choices in a Mass Effect like style. This is fun until you realize that your choices really don't matter much. You can go into a town and kill everyone, but that just means you killed a bunch of quest givers, so there really isn't a point. It feels like EA put a lot of effort into making the expansions and just left the bugs, because fixing bugs doesn't make money.  Overall this was an okay game and I recommend it if you'd like a nice time sink, can get it cheap, and can overlook the cheap design and buggy gameplay.",1,0

"From my original review, Postal III was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful sequel to Postal 2.  However, let's take it back a few notches.  Postal III is a third person shooter, unlike Postal 2, which was a first person shooter. The game, gameplay wise, is similar to Postal 2. You shoot ♥♥♥♥ and perform tasks. However, Postal III introduces alignment. You can be good, or bad, and depending on your actions, you get different endings. For example, helping cops bust a hippie pot ring aligns you Good. Killing everyone during the bust aligns you Bad. That is a pretty cool feature that makes this game one of the more unique Postal games.  The game makes outside references to the likes of people such as the infamous director Uwe Boll, Gary Coleman from Postal 2, and other such things. It's got the Postal feel, and everything that is there is great, but it doesn't work all the time.  That's really my only main complaint with the game. Due to layoffs and rushes, the game is extremely buggy, and crashes often. The game runs on Valve's Source Engine.  Postal III on the inside has all the mechanics and gameplay aspects to make a good Postal game. However, on the outside, it's a buggy mess that crashes often, has gameplay breaking bugs such as cutscenes not playing, parts of the map unrendering, and other such things.   It's price isn't really warranted, considering it is a buggy crashing mess. If you get it gifted, or buy it out of curiosity, you might be dissapointed, but the game itself is still enjoyable if you can look passed it's flaws.",1,0

"The game is actually good, just not for the price.  I picked this up for three dollars, it came with another game and it was at Dollarama in a physical case. I figured multiplayer on Steam was a thing, since I originally bought a copy for my friend from the same Dollarama and noticed it had steam.  I'm a bit disappointed that it still doesn't exist, same with a lot of features that you'd expect. However, it seems to be ready for multiplayer to be added, as well as the ability to support never-incoming workshop content, since the mods are all really simple reskins.  The game is very simple and fun, and the story is mature, B-movie level garbage, as if Kung Pow: Enter the Fist was directed by Cheech and Chong.   If anyone can find Mr. Healey and get him to mend in workshop and multiplayer or pass the license off to someone willing and capable, it might do a whole hell of a lot better, rather than abandoning it for the PSN version, or even the iTunes comedy doodle version.  Worth 3 bucks, not 10.",1,0

"Tips for noobs:  ~ Skills ~ -Alchemy, lockpicking, persuasion, and stealth are useless skills. -Up to 5 levels of each skill can be found or bought in the game (6 with DLC). -Detect hidden should be invested in immediatly. I've found Purples and Yellows in hidden chests. -Blacksmithing is incredibly OP. -Fateweavers reset all skills. Use this to maximize your training potential (You can be too overleveled in a skill to train it) -Mercantile is excellent for early game. Once you have 2mil+ gold, reallocate those points to something worthwhile.   ~ Combat ~  -Bows with the 7 charged shot ability can one shot bosses when fired at close range.  -Invest early in +health/second gear. This keeps you from overusing health pots.  -Weapon damage stats may be misleading. A Dagger with 30 phys and 30 piercing will read 60 damage. Another dagger with 20 Phys, 20 Piercing and 20 poison/5 seconds will also read as 60 damage. -Use Reckoning often; it's quick to recharge. Combine with experience potions for exponentially more exp.   ~ Misc ~ -Quests are black and white regarding moral choices. These have little repercussions. -You will outlevel the available gear considerably. -Many zones and quests will be skipped. -NEVER repair via a blacksmith. Always use repair kits, it's astronomically cheaper this way (even with 0 Blacksmithing skill) -Explore early. This aids greatly when fast traveling from redundant quest to redundant quest.  -You can buy back EVERYTHING you've ever sold in the game. Only sell to the Fence in Star's Camp. That way you can buyback anything you want (even if you stole it) if you choose to respec.",1,0

"RECOMMENDED JUST FOR NOSTALGIA, besides that, NOT RECOMMENDED!  It's the father to the modern Counter Strikes and FPS in general. That's a fact, but that doesn't mean you should play this. We have CSGO now, it would be ridiculous to pick up a old, outdated and dying game like CS 1.6. Those who play it do so cause they've been doing it for 15+ years, but no new players arrive and it is too much blocky graphically to be even considered for purchase these days.  Great game, but too old/outdated and dying. Don't recommend, unless you're here to get some nostalgia from the old days. (I still give it thumbs up cause it's still a GREAT game and we can't publish a analysis thinking on the time we are but on the time the game was made, to compare it to it's days instead of current days)",0,1

"'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.' A review by Richard Valkinsenn.  EDIT: My original review of Modern Warfare 2 has been updated to reflect my changed opinion of the game. I have a lot to say about it, and not a lot of it's good. The review is now broken up into two sections and will cover the game's campaign and multiplayer suites, respectively.  ---- CAMPAIGN REVIEW ----  Modern Warfare 2 is the pinnacle of the Call of Duty series, second only to it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. Unfortunately, factoring in both the game's single-player and multiplayer suites, that's not really saying much. Campaign-wise, admittedly, Modern Warfare 2's campaign does feature a thrilling, well-acted campaign, and comes packed with thrills and chills, the latter of which is mostly contained in the campaign's notorious 'No Russian' mission. While the campaign's level design is linear, thankfully the player is given a wide variety of roles throughout the game's runtime. One level will feature a tense series of firefights with loads of enemies while another will have the player moving stealthily in a semi-linear fashion from point A to point B. As for long-lasting appeal, somehow, Modern Warfare 2 has a charm that has withstood the test of time.  The campaign also features a co-op mode featuring missions based on scenarios seen not just in Modern Warfare 2 but also it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. These missions are widely varied and feature time attacks, stealth missions, and other various modes for up to two players to engage in. There are a few missions which require no less than two players, but thankfully, the majority of the missions can be completed solo, if players so desire.  Sadly, while the campaign and co-op modes are pretty solid, as far as a PC port goes, the entire package as a whole is found wanting. For starters, the game's options lack many essential PC features, like a Field of View (FOV) slider. In fact, it seems the developers went out of the way to make it difficult to even edit the native FOV via console or cfg edits. Not to mention the fact that the lack of separated audio sliders makes trying to tailor the game's audio experience to one's liking impossible. What makes it even worse is the lack of mod support, meaning basically that making custom content for the game is something that's just not gonna happen. Above all else, what makes it all even worse is the game's multiplayer suite, which only serves to highlight many of the game's glaring faults.  Campaign Verdict: I liked it.  ---- MULTIPLAYER REVIEW ----  Years ago, I played Modern Warfare 2 on Xbox LIVE and rather enjoyed it. However, having transitioned to the PC in the last several years and having played other, superior online titles, I've found Modern Warfare 2's PC multiplayer suite to be nothing short of a train wreck.  In addition to the glaring lack of an FOV slider, so much power and choice was taken out of the player's hands in this game. Dedicated servers, or at least a server browser for choosing matches is non-existent. Voting to kick or ban problematic players was left out. Mod support for custom content is gone. A much-needed feature like hiding the in-game chat log is just not there. And sure you could host a private match, but hosting a public match with custom rules and map rotations is a thing of the past. Well, unless you hack it in, but then you run the risk of getting hit with a Valve Anti-Cheat ban.  Then you get to the actual gameplay that Modern Warfare 2 has to offer... and it gets a little better and a lot worse from there. While MW2's maps are thankfully not as restrictive as later titles in the overall series, they still suffer from a near-complete lack of interactivity. Not everything about the maps is terrible, however, as they do allow for a multitude of different tactics and approaches, though this also applies to hiding spots and long, open stretches for campers to exploit. As far as the game's arsenal and perks go, there's a lot of room for mixing and matching to create a lot of different approaches and playstyles. At the same time, weapon customization is sadly hampered by the fact that only one attachment is allowed at a time, though a certain perk can allow up to two. However, adding this perk to a loadout means that no other perks in that perk's category can be applied.  Above all else, there's one thing that makes Modern Warfare 2 just about unbearable at any time, and it's an issue that also extends to the entire series, overall. A lot of the methods for getting kills in Modern Warfare 2 require little to no skill to employ. An example would be the addition of quick, one-hit knife kills that can be require little more than a button press, in addition to lethal traps that can be laid for other players. Several of the game's perks also exacerbate this, like a perk that expands the lethal radius for explosives or another that increases the distance over which knife kills apply. Not to mention the fact that the game doesn't treat fired shots like projectiles; once the sights are lined up, bullet hits are instantly guaranteed, no matter the distance.  Overall, while it has many high points, Modern Warfare 2 on the PC leaves way too much to be desired. A glaring lack of much-needed PC features along with an array of lackluster gameplay features sours an online and even offline experience with lots of untapped potential.  Multiplayer Verdict: It could've been much better.",1,0

"While OMD is a very cute game, it suffers from some fairly crippling design flaws. Firstly, most of the levels' difficulty results directly from one decision the devs made; instead of allowing choke-points or open spaces or a single path, the people who made this game decided that each level be bifurcated, but provided portals to allow us to traverse the two. Pick one, devs. Difficulty or ease. As well, barricades are among the most expensive single buildables. In this vein, it is much more economically viable to murder all the monsters yourself, as traps are A) very expensive and B) reset much too slowly. So why, for the love of Atheismo, is there only a 'cash bonus to trap kills' purchaseable!? Why can't we simply rely on weapons? Oh, right-- because the devs decided to split each level in two, so we can't simply use one route or the other. You're forced to use both the (mandatory) crossbow and (shoddy, unreliable) traps. Still, it's a fun romp, even for its faults and flaws.",1,0
"This Part of the Call of Duty Frabchise was pretty much fun back in the days of its release, nowdays you will most likely only find hacked lobbies &amp; hackers playing online.

"The games dead. Its basically worthless to anyone in USA unless you want to play with third worlders. Even then theres only a few servers it looks like. I would rather die than play with South Americans. Anything south of the US border is just hell ( I have never had a positive experience online with these people and if you know anything about geopolitics I need not go into that), so I advise not dealing with these peoples idiocy and just going with CSGO these days unless you want to LAN this game.  One of the greatest FPS games to ever come out and will forever remain a classic but also a game that can still compete design and gameplay wise with games released in more current times. We will never have the natural form of support from players and ESPORTS ever again. This is before ESports was just a way for devs to market and shill a game. This was from when people who liked to play a game competed and not just a bunch of rich kids trying to win monetary prizes like ESports is now (who else could play CSGO all day erry day in this economy?)  People got behind this game because they liked it, instead CSGO is all about market manipulation and human psychology manipulating with less consideration about gameplay because they want the most monetary return. If the idiots will pay hundreds for a digital knife skin then why would any company invest in gameplay that won't have direct returns like a digital nongood would have?  The video game market is full of idiots who will dump money into anything now just so they can distract themselves from the politcs, economics, and slowly declining living conditions of the western world. Bread and circus in its truest form.  CS 1.6 is from better days, more honest days. When people who wanted to make games, and people who wanted to play games were very closely related and the average IQ of someone who was online was higher than now. These days every idiot has an internet connection. That is to say, the target audience then was just better than the target audiences of todays games. This is exampled many times in economics.

"One will find it is quite easy to encounter persons of highly polished skills in the original version of the Counter-Strike games. This is evidenced by thousands of hours on many of the players records; keep in mind that Steam has not been tracking game hours for a good few years after it first came out with this mod!  I highly suggest one passes by this out of date game, as classic as it may be. I compare an exaggeration of the experience for a new player to that of being anally entered, spontaneously, by barbed nethers. Overwhelming, painful, and a strong sense of defenselessness.  One would do well to instead spend their time playing the latest, 'sexiest' version, anyway. After all, the gameplay is an evolution on the one this game has to offer. I also recommend passing over the current middle-child version: Source.",1,0

"This game is obscenely huge. My guess is that it's about 3/4 size of vanilla WoW, and it kinda feels like wow. It has tons of dialogue and quests, all of which have voice over. It must have been very expensive to put this thing together.   Combat system is solid, you have to actively move around dodge or parry/block incoming attacks. There are 9 type of weapons and each type lets you perform different moves.  You can develope your character in 3 main ways (destinies). Warrior, rogue, mage or you can mix there 3 trees to your taste. But spending point in trees lets you unlock so called Twist of Fate cards which provide you additional bonuses, the more point you spent in one tree the better cards you unlock (capped at 109 points). There are cards for dualdestinies or even tripledestiny if you choose to distribute your point in all 3 trees, but point are limited so you may not have enough to get the highest tier abilities in trees. And if you build you character 'wrong' or you are bored by one playstile you can always visit a Fateweaver npc who will reset you pints, for a price.  Last but not least there is this  reckoning . It's basicly a god-mode you can activate when your  fate bar  is full, you gain fate in combat. Time slows down and you deal additional damage, your fate bar slowly drains. Whenever you defeat enemy in this mode you can perform spectacular finisher and thus gain up to 100% experince for every enemy you defeated before you chose to finish one.  It all sounds good right? Almost too good, and that is the problem. Due to game's sheer size there a high probability that you will get bored, sooner or later gameplay becomes stale. Also story isn't the best, it starts off with rpg's evergreen cliché, amnesia. And honestly in the end I wasn't paying much attention so I'm not entirely what was the deal with your protagonist.  I'm not saying that there are no player who would enjoy this game from start to finish, but I'm certainly not one of them. It took me several hour to get to it, then I had fun and 40 hours later it was getting more and more boring again and I rushed through last 2 regions (Klurikon &amp; Alabastra). This game has certaily it's value it's just not that fun to play for long. Maybe it's way too big.",1,0
