Ruined my life.,1
"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1
This game saved my virginity.,1

"Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this. I've got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP. And too all the people who will keep playing this game, all I can say, as always, GL &amp; HF &lt;3",1

"CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best  game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.  It starts off with a team trying to kill another team.   I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.  Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.  When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.  CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.  Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.  In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).",1

Best shooter for 10 years. Steam evolved because of this game.,1
"One of the best FPS Games, the 1.6 Version will stay always in our hearts. I recommend it vor everyone who wants a tactical/action shooter.",1

Playing it since 2010. Still bad at it.   10/10 Best game in CS series.,1
This game is the best game forever &lt;3,1
"Blame this game for the rise of the online multiplayer modern military shooter. Good game, great custom maps, terrible community. Not much has really changed since 2000, has it?  I don't think anyone still plays this particular version of CS though.  Edit: Wait, there are over 8,000 people in-game right now. Wow... guess I have to give this a 'yes' then because it isn't dead.",1

Best game ever! Started my gaming addiction :D,1
Probably the best FPS shooter ever made. Nothing can beat Counter-Strike 1.6.,1
Playing this game since 2001. It ruined my life. Five stars.,1
"  Update to my review with some shameless advertising 05/10/2016:   Hey readers. I am now hosting a server on CS 1.6 where you can play and enjoy the fun experiences I did back in the day.   Map rotations vary from Vehicle, Aim, Surf, Knife, Defusal, and Hostage maps! IP Address: 173.199.73.78:27025     Review 21/10/2014:   I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.  Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.  You can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?  Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...  There is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles.   1337/10  Leet crew 5 lyf  Kicks csgo's ♥♥♥ by a mile. I forgot how good wallbanging is in this game.  P.S - CS 1.6 is the only Counter Strike game where you can headshot with a knife or buy Riot Shields. Enjoy!  Oh yeah, you don't have to pay to use sprays in this game either.",1
"Well, look at my hours played you can already tell if it's a good game or not.         (YES IT IS)",1
Still better than Call of Duty!,1

"First of all its my first online game ever. I was very young and i was playing with my friends LAN matches sometimes for fun sometimes with bets the loser treats refreshments. xD This game its the reason that i maked my mum to buy me a PC to playing this game at my home. With the time i learn how to modding on CS 1.6 servers,plugins and more stuffs about PC. After this i learn how to aim on the enemy head, how to fire inside the walls, how to hear someone with his steps and HOW TO FIGHT!!! I have played many FPS(First Person Shooter) Games that they called me hacker of my fast killing. I had so fyckin good and bad moments on that game that i will not forget never. For others its only a game for me it was MY LIFE! This wasnt a review but a little story.  SO COUNTER-STRIKE FTW ♥♥♥♥♥♥ES!!",1
" After 14 years of existence, this legendary game is still in the Steam top 10 most played multiplayers in the world .   While earning tons of money based on Counter-Strike sales, Valve shows its appreciation to the players that bought the game by still not maintaining it and treating it like it doesn't even exist. Even more, starting with February 2013, Valve has released a couple of minor updates for Counter-Strike which intentionally created problems for the game(suddenly stopping afterwards) so that the players would be forced to migrate to and buy CS:GO(which currently has and most probably will keep having major problems like fps drops and hit misdetection - problem present on all Source engine based multiplayers since 2004).  Congratulations, Valve .    Counting the players that migrated to or play the non-Steam version of Counter-Strike, the game still easily classifies itself even today in the top 5 most played multiplayers in the world .",1

"I only write this because of how nostalgic I feel. The game that gave me my passion for shooters. Hands down, in my opinion, best game made in history.  This game, I cannot explain how many emotions it gave me, and thousands or millions of other players.  Cs 1.6, please stay alive.   Pros- Everything Cons- Nothing",1
"'Lock and Load.' 'Go go go!' 'Fire in the hole!' 'The bomb has been planted.' 'Counter-terrorists/terrorists Win.'  It is uncountable just how many times have these few sentences echoed in cybercafés across the world. For many, days were spent in front of the computer screen, manipulating the WASD keys with left hand and whirling the mouse with the right one. People yell and frown, they cheer and jeer as they team up their cyber-persona and pit them against another team. It doesn’t matter who won, who lost, who managed to kill to most of their opponents and who died the most, as everything will be scrambled up and reset when a new match begins. What is important is that, for those who are a part of the team, this computer game is their reality. These personas within the computer screen are their true identities. This is counter-strike.   Originally a modification (mod in short) made for Valve’s critically acclaimed Half-Life, Counter-Strike has gained much prominence since its initial launch. It is one of the first and definitely one of the most critically acclaimed multi-player computer games of all times. It is also the game used for many professional electronic sports competitions, such as ESEA League. Of course, this does not put Counter-Strike as a “professional only” game, as it has been enjoyed by many since its launch.  Getting started with Counter-strike is simple. You start off in one of the two teams: Counter-Terrorists or Terrorists. Before the round begins, you will have to purchase your own gun from the market, namely the famous AK47, M4A1, Desert Eagle, MP5, AWP and many more. Do not ask me why the counter-terrorists (namely the police) have to buy their own gun, and that they will have to go out with their lousy default colt pistols. Perhaps the government had some budget cuts and the SWATs have to buy their own guns. No one knows, but at least this will balance up the game. Also, you can equipment such as Highly-Explosive grenades, Flash-bangs (not recommend for beginners), smoke grenades, helmets and kevlars. You can also grab a defuse kit if you are playing on the side of the counter-terrorist, but normally we will steal that from dead teammates. Oh and you will be given a knife for free. Don’t worry about it, as most likely you use it to run instead of anything else.  The gameplay is fairly straightforward as well. There are quite a few number of game mods. The most frequently played ones are the Bomb Defusal maps, such as the all-time famous de_dust, the Hostage Rescue maps such as cs_assault, the VIP Escorting maps and the Kill Them All maps, such as the custom fy_iceworld and awp_map. Like all multi-player First Person Shooters, you will need good coordination and communication with your teammates if you want to win. Don’t worry about it though, because if you are new, just stick around and listen to what others have got to say. Just remember, you are not John Rambo, you only have 100 HP, and a stray bullet from a sniper rifle (AWP) will deal more damage than that.  As time press on, the mechanism of Counter-Strike became outdate. Of course, the legacy of Counter-Strike continues through its successors such as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike Online (Asia only) and, the newest of all, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Throughout the years, Counter-Strike has evolved to become what it is today while its legend remains. Together with Half-Life and (maybe) Team Fortress Classic, Counter-Strike has not only helped Valve to thrive as a gaming company, but also defined what First Person Shooter should be.",1
10/10 Would get 'Fire in the hole' tattooed on my ♥♥♥.  Again.,1
It's a nice game...,1

"Nice oldschool game! Counter-Strike is very cool game, but now we can play the CS series of games like CS:Source and CS:GO... I can't say which game is better, it's your choice. But i can't forget this game like my childhood, thanks to VaLVE for it!",1
I tried it a few times.,1
"With only ~4000 hours of playtime (plus a few thousand prior to Steam), i might not be worthy of reviewing this game.  So i'll just leave it at: recommended.",1
"Counter-Strike is a great series. Though the real change they made was in CS:GO, Counter-Strike has been one of my favorite FPS games of all time. If you prefer a fast based shooter, this game isn't for you.  Counter-Strike can have exciting moments where it's you VS 5 others, or where you have no defuse kit with only a few seconds left to defuse the bomb  A comparable version of Counter-Strike's defuse gametype is the Call Of Duty 'Search and Destroy'",1
"This game is like an infection, you can't uninstall it.",1
"Compared to CS:GO, this is pure gold. Joined a French server where I asked if they could speak english, and they did. Someone said no rush and everyone listened. The community is way more friendlier and the game isn't about how volvo can make more money.",1
enjoyed the game for only a few minutes...,1

"Steam Awards Nomination 2016 (review for the badge)   When I saw the The “Just 5 More Minutes” award category :: instant flashback &amp; cold sweat..   Year; 2005, clock; around 7 pm. Tomorrow is school day and I'm at a local Internet Cafe playing with some friends ::  Counter Strike 1.6  :: time flies, u know how, its CS. Cell phone rings; constantly. 'Yes, I'm coming home, just need to finish the match, 5 minutes top'. I'm losing .. big time. I skipped some calls later (big mistake) for the sake of the match. Long story short, I was late and there were consequences. Left in hurry after and didn't pay the net fee, not that day at least. Time; 1+ am, game-over.",1
This game will never get old &lt;3,1
It's a real legend .. legend of PC games,1
There's nothing to say about this... :)   Legend  ,1
"First starting off as a cute, little mod based on the GoldSrc engine, a heavily modified Quake engine, Counter-Strike's legacy continues to strife for a decade and a half over. Initially developed and released on top of a Half-Life modification, with the inspiration from the developer's strong theme and intriguement for military warfare and terrorism, the mod's success was immediately a marvel to behold; selling over 25 million units as a whole in the Counter-Strike franchise.  The maps and various scenarios set around the globe, players assume the roles of soldiers on two teams, counter-terrorists and terrorists. Both with a task, depending differently on the mission. Bomb scenarios, the terrorist team must plant a bomb, in a secured bomb location, while the counter-terrorists must fight back and ultimately defuse the bomb, if it may have been planted. Hostage scenarios is where the counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages being held by the terrorists. With both these modes, it has become a traditional campaign over time in different sequels.  The player, depending on what team they have been assigned to, can change their class into eight different character models, as well as buying weaponry and equipment, such as armour and grenades to help against the opposing team. As the round is about to begin, you're left in ''Freeze time'' that allows you to buy things with the money you earned by killing opponents the rounds before. This of course, gives players the time needed to choose wisely on what many strategies they will execute and whether it will be successful compared to your opponents.   This game is also highly customizable on the player's end.The game gives the options allowing for the user to either install or create their own custom skins, spray graphics, sprites, sound effects and HUDS that can be used in-game. I forgot to mention that modding is possibly one the biggest things that makes Counter-Strike such a versatile game to begin with.  I don't have much to complain about this game, other than it's become one of the biggest targets of hacking and cheaters, since its release. Aimbots, that auto-target other players while the player should naturally aim and shoot is just on of the many cheatings that players have executed. Wallhacks, that allows the player to see through walls through work by displaying objects that have translucent textures and can easily see targets through them, while the opposing team has no idea from their own perspective. To me, the cheating in this game is now more to do with experimenting than it is to do with cheating overall.   There's a different meaning when it comes to something that is outdated and old-school. Old-school is for nostalgic value, something that will guarantee to put a smile back on your face from all these past memories you've experienced and this is what the first title of Counter-Strike engulfs. Outdated, being something you don't particularly want to go back to, while there is the famous remake, Counter-Strike: Source, that runs on the more powerful and overly-recycled Source engine, allowing for better graphic and communication capabilities. Nevertheless, if you're looking for original flare that is burning in the Counter-Strike series, this game is definitely for you.  And to think, all of this success for the Counter-Strike series began as small little mod. Proof on how something so little, can create something so big. Recommended.",1
This game is unlike the other counter strike games. This game requires a different type of skill. You have to become used to the recoil each weapon has. You also have to become familiar with the different advantage points of each map. I personally think this is the best counter-strike game.,1
"I'm sorry to say for other games, but with counter-strike 1.6 i had best gaming experience in my life.",1
I've had lots of fun with this game. Graphics are outdated but community is still here to support it.,1
best sequal to pokemon since skyrim,1
"Ah, this is where it all started from.. The mecca of online competitive scene.. I still remember bunking my extra classes, and play this game in a bunker of a gaming center, during my school days. I didnt think, that it would take root inside of me, that would fruit up, some years later.  Come the post graduation years, and I found myself playing this again, this time.. on a competitive level and making sure I had fun, the entire time I spent, whistling away at this ..  Fond old memories.. Still growing strong.. Still making more and more, as we keep walking through the life..",1
"The game that started it all. I love Global Offensive but i always return to 1.6 because of the hardcore, old-school feeling.  I don't even know why i'm recommending this because obviously you all have it... Right?",1
If you dont like 1.6 then you can suck some balls,1
Played 60 fps with a 20 dollars laptop. top kek mate,1
Graphics is not everything! :) Old school love.,1
Old but gold. I really can recommend it to new CS GO players at there rise!,1
"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.  Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.  Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.",1
"This game is legendary. This started back in 1999 and haven't got lost the pleasure of playing it. The graphics are not the best, it's an old game, but it's FUN! That was the point of the game! It's one of the best first person shooter in the world, it's not me saying that, all over the world people consider Counter Strike 1.6 one of the best shooter games. And it had lans and big event until CS:GO showed up in 2012. It's still played by LOTS of people. 17 years old and still rocks!!",1

"This game appears to remain No. 1 FPS Action games since 2000 for around 8 to 11 years. It is a intense game as your health and your exposure is important as well sticking together with your team mates at all costs. You should maybe try this game and learn the routes in common CS maps like dust or assault. Go on try it!  However they are a several downsides to this game like the weapon nerfs like the recoils and smoke grenade failing to detonate airborne and the lame Tactical Shield. And cos this game is so popular that thousands of servers host this game online, that some PC criminals tend to take advantage on players like using hacking or server addon hacking materials. So you maybe best to stay clear of weird or dodgy servers with extreme adult material and Steam cannot unban victims who got hijacked and VAC banned, so please be careful!  But if you are old and wise enough to handle this intense action game...BUY IT, SOLDIER!",1
Oldshool classic. Totally worth of buying it!,1
More than 15 years and yet best FPS ever made.,1
I want to you add achivements for CS 1.6 because game is legendary!,1
Wordless.... very very good.,1

"In the days of my youth I was told what it means to be the game And now I've reached that age I try to do all those things without a shame No matter how I try I find my way to the same old jam  Good times, bad times You know there was a game When a woman left home for a brown-eyed man But I still play and not seem to care  Sixteen, I fell in love with a game as sweet as could be It only took a couple of years till I was rid of it I swore that I won't play again and I did not come back But when that CS:GO came out I knew it will be sad  Good times, bad imes You know graphs' not at 1st place When a 'smurf' plays against silver ranked men Bring me back to those happy days  Hitbox was good and people were kind now it's not the same Those amazing rounds deep on my mind and all the pros into hall of fame If you talk about cybersport so that game was of that type Now just money flows like a river and everyone's getting hyped  Good times, bad times You know what do I mean When people were saying - go 1 on 1? And you knew it will be fun   9.3    Nearly the best online game in the world.  Don't start playing GO if you haven't played that... who am I talking to, you never played you never will.",1

Childhood,1
Best FPS game of all time. It's a shame only a few people still play it. Great for older Counter Strike players and newer ones to experience what older players had with this game :) This is where Counter-Strike is love Counter-Strike is life really have a meaning.  After several thousand hours in the game I still love and cherish it. A must have for any FPS player out there.,1

Pillar of Online FPS gaming.  This game will never die no matter how many new versions are launched :),1
"Simply THE best shooter that you can play, to forget the anger that built up inside of you after playing too much CS:GO. It truely is a relief to play another shooter than CS:GO, without messing with your aim, movement, etc.  Just set everything up the way it is in CS:GO (sensitivity, key-binds, etc.) and escape from the austerity pressure to perform well in CS:GO. And RELAX theres nothing you can do wrong here. Even when there's a cheater, just don't give a f. I mean, there isn't even a stats-record. Like there's only a serversided stats-tracking if at all. So without specifically searching for your stats on a specific server that has some kind of player-stats on it, nobody will ever know how bad you are/were :)",1
"The “Test of Time” Award  This award is for the game that is just as good today as the day you first played it. Newer games may come out, but it doesn’t matter… you’ll always come back to play this one.  ;)",1
1.6 = my midle school years...my best years ever...1.6 full of life full of memories 1.6 = &lt;3,1
Dropping in an old review here. Always a fun game but too bad the newer versions has taken over.,1
I have 800 hours of gameplay on this (since I got steam!). I played it for 6 years before then. Its wonderful. The best game I have ever played.,1
While people are outside playing Pokemon GO I'm playing a real game.,1
"Counter Strike is the best shooting game, i've ever played. The 'real cs', where you plant bombs etc. is not 10/10 gaming, but look at all those great mods! The greatest thing in cs is playing mod servers, and you do not need to download them from your web, you just simply double click that server, and that's it! At first I recommend to play normal cs, if it gets boring try other servers. Oh and original maps aren't that great, except de_dust2. You must try cs even if you think it has low graphics. Gameplay is much more important than graphics, remember that!",1
"I still remember this from my childhood, It was the first FPS game that I ever played in a computer.  8.5/10",1
"A still alive first-person shooter, since 2000. The game that changed everything, along with Half-Life. Still, the best first-person for thousands. And you know why? Because this game's focus isn't on graphics. It's for having fun with your friends, or, even aim for world turnaments.  All proffesional teams, such as fnatic, navi, sk, still play Counter-Strike, doesn't matter if it is 1.6, Source or Global Offensive.   Highly recommend this game.",1
"I don't like because Steam blocked redirections from server to server. I know that people using it to slowhack, but now... servers with redirection are unusefull..  Also, VAC not working good for Counter-Strike 1.6. Maybe it could be good for some update, or something...   I can give you anything you need for it.  Contact me.  Kinds and Regards, drag1c.",1
it's a good game butu must to make strong vac ban bcz cheaters those days a lot in 1 .6 they make game suck :\ u must control this game bcz it's international game and a lot of people love it  and thx for read my review,1
"Such a highly reccomended game for those who want to get it, playing this game in 2016 reminds me of the old style games i used to play on the playstation 2.  I recently came back to play this game due to the fact Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is simply a great game and wanting to seen the origin.  10/10",1

I've never met so many Brazilians in my life! 10/10,1
"Arguably the best competitive fps so far, the skill ceiling is very high; however getting started is easy.",1
"Old good game never dies.  I remember first time playing this game when I was in elementary school. Hiding teacher to play this game with friends is very fun, you should let your kid have experiences like this.",1
"One of the most favourite game of my childhood I have spent so much time playing it and I loved it.  From a little cute Half-Life mod to this... When Counter-Strike was first released it gained it's popularity immediately and become number 1 online action game, one of the most successful competitive games ever created which was easy to learn but hard to master, now Counter-Strike is dead or at least for someone because it's pro scene died in 2012, yes the pro scene is dead but the game itself is still alive, after so many years people still play and love this game, even it's pro scene lasted for unreal time, imagine it started in 2000 year and lasted for 12 years how cannot this be legendary, it's when graphics doesn't matter only gameplay.  I strongly recommend to play this game at least once if you have ever played it and enjoyed, it might not be as fun as before but I still recommend, if you like original games or havent played CS at all and started from CS:S, CS:GO doesn't matter... You should really give it a try.",1
Best competetive game of all time.,1
i have been playing this game since dial up and absolutely love it addicted. never know what some one is gonna do. fy is deatchmatch de is bomb map cs maps are hostage many mods and plugins that keep the game exciting and new along w new custom maps being made frequently,1
Nice game,1
I miss the good ole GldSrc engine,1
This game is just amaizing. If you have a game with cheaters then change the server with admins that actualy do stuff right like cs.kopideja.lv  Yes The graphics are outdated and the physix may make no sense but this is what started it all... If you havent played this and you play other CS games then you know nothing about this game... Buy it play it and enjoy  For me this game is more fun than CS:GO or CS:S because its calssic and was a my favorite childhood game 10/10,1
Played it over 2000hours..woah.. all i can say is..this...is old but gold.. Couldn't let go of 1.6 even after csgo came out.Cs is just so much fun!,1
A must have classic.,1
"Counter Strike 1.6  The only game that lets you have a 5 kill streak and a defuse with 300+ ping  11/10- Would lag again.  Also, a surprisingly successful dating program. Watch the chat when a girl gamer joins the server and see how many players hit on her. Counter Strike is truly the definition of 'international love'.",1
  miss this game ♥,1
"Score says it all. There's another version out called Counter-Strike: Source, but it's nothing compared to how the original Counter-Strike is. Plus, now adays it's really really cheap, like 10 dollars off of steam. As well, it has like the biggest competitive gaming community in the world, with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of tournaments and players etc... good stuff.",1
Think you got skills because you came from CS:GO?  Think you got skills cause you came from COD?  Think you got skills cause you just bought fallout 4 and still got money left on your steam account?   Well let me tell you a story.         You're going to suck ♥♥♥.       Alot of ♥♥♥.,1
NOSTALGIA  classic footstep sounds classic knife default weapons no 'Russians' no troll not p2w [ same all cs games - (but nexon zombies is p2w) everything is O.K. + 11/10 Best game ever. -,1
Perfect for anybody who like shooter game. Just be careful when searching server though.,1
Gaming History!,1
best bhops 2003,1
"Quake was the first game I was ever really addicted to and focused a big portion of my time on for months or years at a time. Counter-Strike was the second - and easily more addicting. There's a reason that I still compare every multi-player shooter experience back to original Counter-Strike, to this day. There's a reason I still compare every server community to this (Counter-Strike servers each had their own community and personality and people truly got to know each other back in the day, compared to these days, where a server is just something you're automatically dumped into and feels like every other server).  Despite many iterations, nothing quite plays like the original. It's not hard to see why there are still 10,000 to 60,000 people playing this  at any one time on any day , fifteen years after launch and why it is always in the top ten games currently being played on all of Steam.  This is where it all started. Without this, there's an entire genre of shooter and multi-player that just vanishes. The original days of Counter-Strike remain the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my entire life. It's unlikely that will ever be trumped.",1
"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.  Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.  Counter-Strike is a good game. I recommend this game.  Rating 8/10",1
Dont buy this game it's too much fun,1
Consumed my teen years. LANs lans and more lans. Memories.,1
How to end your life  Step 1 - Download this game  done .,1
"Counter-Strike was the game that changed everything for me in FPS games, coming from older games like the FPS Game Blood back in (1997) when I was only 10 years old and Half-Life, Counter-Strike changed everything for me it was litterally the best thing ever.  The quality of the game was never about the visuals for me but about the game play and performance and Counter-Strike litterally had it all in my opinion.  Even today after so many years, I occasionally come back and play Counter-Strike just because it is one of the greatest Counter-Strike versions flat out, anyone disputing this are most likely people that started playing either Counter-Strike: Source or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive first then tried Counter-Strike but if you played it in the right order there is no disputing this, because this game might frighten most the new generation that has expectations to visual graphics having to have a certain standard before they will even touch it.  Counter-Strike is not about the visuals, that is just a bonus, if you want visuals then you probably playing the wrong game, Counter-Strike was never Battlefield nor CoD which probably to many looks visually stunning.  If you want quality in a game then Counter-Strike is one of the best games to play and get, hence why I am recommending this game.",1
Best CS of all time!!!,1
Awesome oldschool game ;),1
"Nice game, my first time PC games.  9/10",1
"Play this game to understand why we say this game is the best FPS of one in the world.  Counter-Strike is release over 10 years. but a lot of player still play this game. (including me).  Why? Because is so easy, fun, and memory. I am play Counter-Strike started in 2002 to now. is over 10 years.  Is like Half - Life . This game is revolution in FPS.",1

Best Game Ever xD But I Cant Play It On My MAC :/,1
The best competitive first person shooter ever created.,1
"Game is really good. I like it because of the genre of the game.  I will do some pros and cons for the game  PROS -This game is really old (15 years now), and people still buy it and play it -The game has over 3500 dedicated servers -The community is really big for the game this old -There are really good welcoming server admins -The game has good graphics even for the 15 year old game -It's fun to play  CONS -Some server admins are kicking people because of their high Latency -You have to have really good connection to the internet to play the game as it is meant to be played  I recommed it. I rate it 8/10, would Flashbang my teammate again!!",1
pleying it after school itz very funny,1

Still the best of counter-strike! :) keep it alive,1
The game may be old now but it is still a great game and full of fun custom maps. It's a good way to spend time with frineds and/or family with low hardware requirments and cheaper pricing. The game may be modded to improve your expierence as well which is allows for more customized game play that never gets old.,1
it was one the best fps games back in a days.. would go back in time when this game was still popular   10/10,1
Harder than CSGO,1
A game that is so much fun and nostalgic.  Brings back so many memories.   Always in my heart. &lt;3  10 / 10 - Still fun nowadays.,1

It was the year 1998, i-ve been having my Pentium3 PC for a few months (just upgraded from a 486 DX2 with windows 3.1) and my cousing comes along and shows me the new game he got...  I ended up playing it for a whole year... over and over again.  And then came along Counter-Strike 1.1 in 2000... and then the other mods from Half-Life.  Thank you for my beautifull childhood",1

" Counter strike is one of the first-played video games when I had a PC 9 years ago.  I had an illegal version installed from a third party website, yes I never heard Steam before. And sitting there, playing against bots almost over the night.  Display - A CRT monitor about 15.6 inches. Processor - Pentium Celeron singel core processor with 2.3 GHz. Graphics - nVidia Geforce 4 MX440  Memory - 256 MB with uknown specs anymore. Up to 80 GB hard disk storage that's all I got.  Later on more games came to me running on this PC for more than 2 years before I got a new one. Wolfstein, Battlefield, Medal of Honor, Half Life, Voice City and something like these. ",1
This game was so fun before css and csgo,1
"Now i know what you guys are probably going to say: 'OMG this game sucks the graphics are bad D:' and like 'Pfff this game is old nobody still plays it. well it's not, its a game that's made like 13 years ago so don't expect frosbite engine graphics etc... instead you get the way more epic pixel-ish graphics and really classic sounds, and this game is still active with about 30k to 40k players each day.(That's more then all cod games together) And in my opinion it's a must have game since it's one of the best games ever and you still can install skins etc and it's price is good it's only 10 euro or dollars for this great game.",1
Classic which started the legendary CS franchise.,1
"A heart-pounding, visceral experience that gets under your skin. The 'just one more round' addiction factor is very high. When you play it properly, with team work that clicks like a well-oiled machine, the game offers a sense of accomplishment and comradery that is simply amazing.Buy it, download it, whatever; just get on board and enjoy. Sure-fire fun for the online enthusiast.",1
"This game is one of best games for me. I recommend this game to all, but i recommend buying Counter Strike: Conditon Zero and completing the game on hardest difficulty two times. Then play Counter Strike. This is one of old generation games so I wanted to buy This game is one of best games for me. I recommend this game to all, but firstly buy Counter Strike: Conditon Zero and complete game on hardest difficul two times. Then play Counter Strike. This is one of the older games so I wanted to buy it first because i wanted see what it was like before. I played that game, my older brothers played aswell . So when you play this game you have the feeling that you went back in time and played it. Gameplay has been perfect for years. The grapichs are still awsome to me, I play a lot of Black Ops 3 on ps4, this is way better than that for me. So if you have pasion and love to games first play Counter Strike , trust me you will had a lot of fun.  I rate the game10/10.",1
  i love this game :),1
Old but gold!,1
"The best FPS game of all time hands down ! I have been playing this game from the early betas right from the begining ! (I still remember to this day, the character's legs weren't moving, it was on cs_siege) This was back in late 1999 or early 2000, now its allmost 2017 and I am still playing ! That is 17 years. This game has stood the test of time. Modern games are spurring like mushrooms with advanced graphics and whatnot, but none of them can give you the experience that this game can give you. I can sincerely say that there are a total of 2 maybe 3 games in all gaming history that can match this game's gaming experience. All in all I recommend this game to any new players who may come across it, who are looking for an amazing online multiplayer experience, and also a big shoutout for the old-school player as myself, don't stop playing this gem ! I sincerelly fear that it will take a very long time until a masterpiece of a game like this will appear, maybe even never. But who knows ? Untill then start cs 1.6 gl and hf ! :)",1
Counter-Strike 1.6 ruined many hours of my life!,1
The best CS version! Old school :-D,1
GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME!,1
"My old game :) , Good Game ever",1
"Buy Condition Zero instead if you want to play with bots. And Global offensive if you want to play multiplayer. But wait, I'm not done yet. Your PC/laptop can't handle CS:GO or CS source but still wants to play Multiplayer? Then this legendary FPS game is the right place to do it.",1

Where it all started :) A true classic to the Counter-Strike Series that will never get old.,1
Great game. A must have for any Steam user.,1
"better than cs:go: - you have spray feature (removed in cs:go) - you have flashlight &amp; nightvision (removed in cs:go) - you have dark maps and/or dark places on a map (removed in cs:go, dark places are pretty bright, this is why there is no more flashlight &amp; nightvision, it destroys the immersion, dark places &amp; dark maps are useful for many aspects ingame (hiding or warcraft server when cloaked or when you want someone to knife) and reminds me of 2002 game bf1942 where dark maps are not really dark lol. VALVE shame on you) - You have character selection (removed in cs:go) - you have no ranking &amp; market feature (added in cs:go, everyone plays cs:go because they think they end up as a rich-♥♥♥♥♥, also on every server there is trade spam in chat and even you get friendrequest spam from traders, also community is not looking at your skill anymore, but at your rank and not every server + singleplayer against bots has rank enabled.)  - You have no CoD clone like CS:GO  Unlike CS:GO, everyone plays this for fun, not for useless skins, money, rank etc.. also, here you cant waste 600$ for a skin. You can get even new models (which does not only change your weapon texture, but the model) from gamebanana for FREE! You can make your M4 look like the G36C etc.  10/10 my fav childhood game",1

"Counter-Strike is a pretty old game of 'shooter', which was developed in 1999, and since 2000, supported by Valve. This game immediately caught on millions of players around the world. The game is a confrontation of terrorists and counter-terrorists, representing the forces of good and evil. Objectives of the opposing sides differ depending on the map, in which the battle.  And here is my thoughs..  This is the most entertaining video game i've ever played since 2007. I think i've played this game like 2000hrs i guess, played only the cracked version in that day... I finally i bought this game and it's worth 10 bucks indeed. I still play CS 1.6 because i had an amazing childhood with it! By that i didn't mean online or with bots but i had lots of LAN-party's in my country and my friends still play it though but theres still Lan-party's sometimes in my country ^^ The game is still fun and it never gets boring! I mean todally this game has lots of gamemodes which is ZM/ZE/CSDM/GUNGAME/FURIEN/SURF/DEATHRUN/BASEBUILDER and more and more and more... It's just fantastic! :D  10/10 Would recommand it!",1

"-Love to shoot people with real life guns with different names? -Have you ever dreamed to kill terrorists and even be a terrorist? -Love playing the same, universal map over and over just because it's the only map you'll ever know? (*cough* dust2) -Have you a desire to work as a team to complete objectives? -Do you know how to speak Brazilian-Portuguese and Romanian? (Awesome because many servers have players that have Brazilians, Romanians, and many other South American/Eurpoean players) -Love nostalgia? -Love to have fun? -Love getting an extra game with bots in it for free?  -Love randomly dying from wallbangs?  Great, you've come to the right game. Seriously though, despite the somewhat smaller North American community (Which is still big for the old game it is) it's probably one of the greatest games i've ever come to play, and i've only had it for about a year, and i'm gonna add hundreds of thousands of hours playing this. I don't even have actual friends that play with me yet I can still have fun with this game. From the countless recoil patterns to remember from all the guns, to the extremely friendly community (for the most part) and playing all these classic maps. Yes, of course there's hackers, you'll see a few of them, but they don't ruin the game. Either the server's admin can just ban them or you can just go to a different server, it's not gamebreaking or anything. And besides, if you get this you also get Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, which has bots. Hell, you can even download Zbots for 1.6, and it waypoints for you! Definitely get this game. This game stands the test of time.  10/10 Would throw brick-looking grenades at terrorists again.",1
" Counter-Strike:  I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer.  Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.  CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. ",1
"If you can't get Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, this is great replacement for it. It's not as popular, but it still has a big amount of players. Some servers may be in languages you can't understand, but the game is still very fun and requires a great amount of skill. One of the best first person shooters, that still holds to this day from 1999. Although the game's graphics...aren't really the best. Even then, you can get skins, map textures, etc. to spice the graphics up a little bit. Though to me, graphics don't really matter. Highly recommend this game. 9.5/10",1
"I've been playing this game for 10 years (7 or 8 years on non-steam), and it still amazes me with the fact that people are still playing this game.

What a super friendly community.  Best multiplayer fps game in the history of mankind, never gets me bored with tons of user-made mod, and one thing that this game never cease to amaze me is the fact that this game has a better hitbox than CS:GO (come at me CS:GO plebs)  1.6/Counter-Strike, would get rekt by a player playing in the earthquake again",1

"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. It was initially developed and released as a Half-Life modification by Minh 'Gooseman' Le and Jess 'Cliffe' Cliffe in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the game's intellectual property acquired. Counter-Strike was first released by Valve on the Microsoft Windows platform in 2000. The game later spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the Counter-Strike series. Several remakes and Ports of Counter-Strike have been released on the Xbox console, as well as OS X and Linux.   Set in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of members of combating teams that include counter-terrorists and terrorists. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the map's objectives, or else killing all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.",1

"CS is fast paced, intense. this game will not disappoint. The 'just one more round' addiction factor is very high. I've been addicted since 2007. I don't have a ♥♥♥♥ing vision for what i am saying. I'm making this ♥♥♥♥ up as I go. Buy it, download it, whatever; just get on board and if you enjoy it you will NEED it!  Counter-Strike 4 life.",1

"Counter Strike, A game which changed the era of First person shooting game since it was born made in 1999 beta version Released on 2000 'The Game' Released on 2002 *I think*   I personally think counterstrike or CS made steam what it is thou Dota 2 and several others are there. This game has been ranked Number# 1 Since 2000 In front of my eyes. Ranked 1 by several industries and one of the most online server recording having more servers than any other game, Game  tracker.com  not rs.",1
im not 12 u idiot im 13. my dad works for valve and if u win im calling hacks and texting him on my nokia to tell him to ban your computer from the internet you noob. my mom owns microsoft so ill break ur windows noob.  if u use mac u need to die.  this game is ok,1
"The mother of all FPS games! Although some may argue that this is a outdated game, I still love it. You get that awesome freedom of movement which you cannot get on CS:S (as much) and on CS:GO. In addition, this game nearly runs on all pc's even potato's with wires. It has a large modding team behind it (AMXX), which isn't affiliated with Valve but nevertheless it makes the game 100x better, and adds amazing mods to it.",1
The best FPS game in history !,1
Even though the new CS is out the old never gets old.,1
So i buy this game to become good at counter strike but i don't good because 1.6 is hard so i buy source to become good at counter strike but source is hard so i buy global offensive to become good at counter strike but i become silver 1 and realise game is not hard... life is hard and friend once told me to kys (kappa your soul) and i think it is great idea! Any way if you good at counter strike game it is fun if not deinstall game because if you're bad at game you are bad. Overall great game but also bad. Yes thank for read!  Btw Paradise Hillz is ugly ♥♥♥♥. Thank for read!,1
"One of best FPS games ever, it's about 14 yrs old, but still getting updates. Thanks valve.",1
"Best Esport game of 21th century .   Good :   -easy to play -no cheaters ( maybe 10% if you play on random pubs) , in CSGO 60% cheating. -best game for tournaments as 5x5 -not boring , you can play again and again to improve ur skill  Bad :  VALVE did not support number one online action/esport game before die  was a lot of bugs   9.7/10  Recommend!",1
"Pew pew since 2000, still works!",1
nice game...very nice,1
i love this im old player,1

Old Good FPS.,1
What a greade game had real good times whit this,1
Its alot of fun.,1
"Yeah... the old Counter-Strike.... Everybody know, what CS is.. Counter-Strike - My rating - 9/10   Why or Why not to play this old classic ?  Positive:  It´s a legendary game, and if u playing games like CS:GO etc. u will like it, cause it will be legendary in your library. Almost everybody played CS 1.6 'from start his cs:go career' Counter-Strike 1.6 is latest and best version on the game, and if u purchase CS, u can play it, if u will download it, there´s is some chance, that u cant play it (Win 8 etc).  Most of legens/pro´s in CS:GO played CS 1.6, it´s like beginning, and it could be your beginning!   Negative: No more good tournaments on CS 1.6 (On CS:GO are tournaments like EMS, Dreamhack etc.) Graphic+Gameplay - Graphic sucks... but its still better then WarZ:P Gameplay.... yeah, crouching sucks, aiming sucks... u know... bad gameplay, if u see CS:GO, when is all so smooth, u will hate CS 1.6... but if u play CS 1.6 before then CS:GO, its good for you, and u will like it (probably:D)  So... my opinion is: It´s legendary game, everyone, who likes FPS must have this in his/her:P steam library. :)   ",1
"Counter-Strike is a pretty old game of 'shooter', which was developed in 1999, and since 2000, supported by Valve. This game immediately caught on millions of players around the world. The game is a confrontation of terrorists and counter-terrorists, representing the forces of good and evil. Objectives of the opposing sides differ depending on the map, in which the battle.  And here is my thoughs...  This is the most entertaining video game i've ever played since 2007. I think i've played this game like 2000hrs i guess, played only the cracked version in that day... I finally i bought this game and it's worth 10 bucks indeed. I still play CS 1.6 because i had an amazing childhood with it! By that i didn't mean online or with bots but i had lots of LAN-party's in my country and my friends still play it though but theres still Lan-party's sometimes in my country ^^ The game is still fun and it never gets boring! I mean todally this game has lots of gamemodes which is ZM/ZE/CSDM/GUNGAME/FURIEN/SURF/DEATHRUN/BASEBUILDER/MIX/PCW/CM/AUTOMIX/BRUSH/ARUSH and more and more and more... It's just fantastic! :D  10/10 Would recommand it!",1

Flashbang my face,1
"One of the best classic multiplayer games ever!  Best gameplay in multiplayer games i've seen.  Most People, who play CS:GO never played CS 1.6, which is kinda sad.. Not a single CS Game can replace 1.6.  Btw. Most E-sport tournaments were held in cs 1.6.  So since CS:GO came out, CS 1.6 kinda lost advantage. (Mostly cause of the years it already has.)  We will miss you 1.6 &lt;3 Thank you for all the love and fun you gave us .. :(  R.I.P.  Remembrance of Counter-Strike 1.6:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrUMZZiheLU ",1

will forever and always be my first love,1
Basically this game was released back in the year 2000 and still is one of the most played games on Steam.  So clearly it must be good because so many are still playing it. I definitely recommend this game and if you don't like to shoot terrorist or counter terrorists you can always try different game modes like zombie modes.  10/10,1

Its old game Bat steal playing all world.. :),1
Hands down the GOAT.,1
"(I've deleted all the comments on this because I wanted to give a serious review about this game and delete my older one, so here ya go)  This is the older Counter-Strike as most people know it. Some people usually don't find enjoyment in playing it due to it being either 'out-dated' or 'glitchy'. I personally tend to enjoy this game from time to time because it's an original game made from the first Source engine, and old school shooters in general ain't too shabby either. Due to the game having a small amount of space to fill in your computer, it rarely ever lags, which makes sure of no interruptions to your enjoyment. It's also just as Competitive as the present Counter-Strike games, though there isn't any seperate Comp gamemode, unfortunately. But that's something that Valve decided to save for later purposes I suppose. Still the King of FPS Games (IMO), I would definetely recommend playing this if you enjoy tactical teamwork in your Online Gaming.",1
i still dont know where A is on dust,1
"Old school! Played this game from the VERY beginning and I still play it. Not as good as I used to be, but I can still hold my ground for an old guy! :D Recommend all players that like FPS games to get this and play it. Still lots of servers out there and still lots of players.",1

"One of the best games ever out there. Yes, it is old but it is JUST amazing. Much better than CoD; and just as good as Battlefied 3 or 4 maybe :P. There are many things tod if you get bored of the tactical playing in games. You can bhop, deathrun, surf and a lot of other things. This honestly should be a $60 game for how good it actually is. So just get this game as it is simply amazing!",1

"I've been playing this game since 2004, this game is mind blowing awesome. If you're not looking deeply into graphics, but just want to have fun playing, then this game is for you. Multiple gamemodes, will keep anyone amused. If you don't have it, then what are you waiting for? Get it now!",1
"Great FPS game, recommended! ",1
Old but gold!:) I like it.,1
It is a good Co-op game for online gamers.,1
"One of the classics of the shooting genre and precursor to most of today's modern shooters, for all the good and the bad that may imply. Counter-Strike 1.6 is the second iteration of the original Half-Life mod and, quite likely, its most popular incarnation. The rather simplistic gameplay coupled with accessible system requirements and intuitive controls make it one of the most long-lived shooters today, still sporting a massive fanbase.  A game that must be tried at least once by any shooting game neophyte.",1

"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.",1
"1,694 hours on CS 1.6.. No regrets.",1
"Played this game for the first time in 2008. Since then I have clocked more than 5000 hours, that's how addictive its multiplayer is. Father of all FPS in MP. Plus has several mods deathmatch, hns, kz, gungame, scrim, zombiemod and paintball. It's been 14 years and the game is still going strong atleast in the Indian scene.",1

But was i also a little geek who couldn`t wait to get back home from school and viciously murder anyone in my path of winning the match?Hells to the yeaah. Note: Can you believe i`m in Medical school, after all of that?  Rainy day cs-playing is the best thing in the world, hands down.

"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.",1

I used to be professional but now I suck at this,  And I dont think i can play as I used to, but it still worth playing this game. Counter Strike is about competition. I'll always like to shoot at my friends' faces.  Counter-Strike is the best game-mod(-game) ever.  Valve wins.",1

"I haven't written a review in a while but I'd like to do one for this game. Before CS:GO came out I played this game every now and then after school but I normally played Source. I started playing this game after I remember the difficulty and skill needed to handle the aiming in this game and honestly after all these years this game is still amazing, if you get the 'These graphics are ♥♥♥♥' mindset and focus on the gameplay it's amazing. It's fast-paced and some of the modded maps are insanely detailed. Amazing game with amazing replay value.",1

Go get it! Fully recommended - 10/10!",1
"CS:GO is good. CS is great.  I keep on playing, and school I will be late.",1

Recommended. Here is the pros/cons of this game in my humble opinion:    PROS,1
"It is a very good, classic game, which started the multiplayer shooter game series of Counter Strike.",1
:$,1
"buy counter-strike 1,6",1
♥♥♥♥!!,1
Counter Strike 1.6 is a box with million unforgivable memories of mine inside. Great coop which you will never get bored by. Most liked deathmatch and zombie mode.,1
Its a good game :D,1
Old game...But GOLD game!,1
"Well, here it is. Some call it 'the mother of shooters', some call it 'bullsh*t'. Well, I can´t tell, whether you will like it, but the fact is, that it started one of the first big shooter franchises ever.   Pros:  -awesome gameplay -awesome gunplay -nostalgia -teambased -mechanics   Cons:  -a bit outdated though   I myself like the classic Counter Strike, but I think there should be big Skillbased MatchMaking Sites like FaceIt or ESEA (if possible even free ones), because the Competetive Mode from Global Offensive is pretty good (even though sometimes it sucks with its rank system).  I think, that it is a great game, but perhaps some players will be put off by the old graphics, but these are pretty good, if you imagine, that this game is about 16 years old.    Must Have for a shooter fan or anyone else who loves 'old' games  9.8/10",1

"So I just played the original Counter Strike, CS1.6 for about an hour and after over 100 hours of both CSS and CSGO, this game is AMAZING! But so different! I love this game and its game series! It taught me tactical gameplay and how much communication is key but this game lacks a bit of that but not much. I absolutely love this and highly recommend it!",1
"Good old game, but time is up!",1
Amazing game . Totaly adictive and loads of fun . Have been playing from quite long now. Never did i get bored of playing counter strike 1.6. :),1
  Old but Gold,1
Absolutely outstanding game. beautifuly made and an absolute masterpeice to say none the least. If you don't have a good PC or want the old cs retro feel. Pick this up and enjoy yourself with some mates. Awesome game.,1
"Game which dragged me in gaming, as outdated and old it is, the best memories for me lies within this game. I mainly played because of mods, which were great, like Zombie Mod, Death Run and WC3FT Mod",1

"Not long before this game becomes yet another timeless tale of gaming's glorious past, and far from dead is that past.   Newcomers to PC Gaming: Point is, it's a classic, and mandatory if you own a PC. So in short, straighten the hell up, ignore your idiot friends nagging you for a game of League or DOTA or BF4 or Planetside or whatever other garbage you've convinced yourself is good, and start from the ground up when you build your collection.",1
"Few years ago, we first heard that CS 1.6 is dead, some organizations have dismissed their CS - team, people screaming that the game is dead and we need to move to CS: GO. It seems that now it is not so! If you pay attention to the broadcast with IEM 6 WC, we see that CS 1.6 By Views prevzashla SC 2, not only is this game broke all past their records. So why CS 1.6 is dead? I beg to differ. According to spectators IEM 6 CS was the best in the tournament. I think CS 1.6 hardly died, she would die only if we want to do! As for CS: GO it grows, developers even began to read the 'Feedback', the game has changed a lot of things. Open Beta -version of the game was to be released after the new year, but I think the developers have not yet sufficiently satisfied with the result. As for the keys to the CS: GO, something I'm working on that would get a couple of the key for you guys! I will write how I succeed!",1
Seriously im playing this game because of kreedz mod and climbing other than that is ♥♥♥♥ but still cool tho,1
"This is the BEST FPS ever, Counter-Strike was the game, which made Esports evolve big time and is the reason for alot of great games today. Without Counter-Strike, i guess alot of good games wouldn't exist today.",1
"Can shoot terrorists and be terrorist. Can plant bomb as terrorist.  Counter-Strike predicting ISIS before it even existed confirmed? More updates as they come.   UPDATE: Valve has replied to my message, and only said 'Never email us again or we will ban your Steam account'. Yes. So I wondered, what if I ran this through my decoder machine? So I ran it through my decoder machine. And it came out as this lonely message: Trump did 7/11.  What could it mean? I'm not really sure. I'll keep you guys posted.   UPDATE #2: I've done extensive research, and it appears that this decoded message either means that Donald J. Trump owns a large chain of convenience stores, or that he is an international terrorist threat. At this point I'm not entirely sure which it is. If you have insight into this topic, please reach me at  xXilluminartyboizXx@internetexplorer.com . Thanks.   UPDATE #3: This might be my final update. I found a note slipped into my underwear when I woke up this morning. It was adressed from Valve. I opened it, naturally. Inside was one, simple sentence: Trump sees all.   Guys, listen, I don't know for sure if Trump did 7/11, or he made ISIS, or anything, but it's been fun trying to figure it out. If I don't make it to another update, and they get to me first, just tell my hamster Poochins that I loved him. Peace out.",1

The best game ever :P,1
The classic. If you haven't played it yet give it a go (oh the pun) and don't let the lack of ShineyGrafix™ disappoint you. I have both the later Source and currently latest GO versions but still come back to the original version from time to time because it is still fun and its classic style is still completely fine... and a lot of people who still play CS regularly shares my view.,1

"Great game, been playing for 11+ years.",1
"This game STILL continue to live on, but why was that? Well it was quite due to that fact that CS:Source isn't that much like by the pros since 2004 as CS:S as quoted: 'Too easy' and such, so the match for cs 1.6 grew more and more and that it was so hyped and praised and good, it still have matches even after 10 years of its 1.6 release (2003 - 2013) in which just kind of died out for CS:GO, but still, because of it's core gameplay and the fact that the commuity has been long just playing this multiplayer long and long and long, it is a game that will take long to die out, since it has a strong community base for it.  Since this game has been, well for long, then you should commonly see the use of wallhacking, cheats, aimbot, fake servers been used today, and the fact that there are quite a lot of empty servers now, but there are populated servers that are good and good community, but there are part of the community been off ever since.  It is seem a bit late to just buy and play this game, but it is still great to check it out if you are new to the cs series, or otherwise if you don't have GNU/Linux (In which I have), then you can buy Counter Strike : Globle Offensive anyway, since it is newer and (I think) has more players and pros playing it now. But if you want to have this raw action, then cs 1.6/cz would be great, you can get the bundle too if you want source as well, but source is fun to play as well.  Verdict: 9.5/10 - It still holds it place.",1
This Game I'm Playing Forever! :),1

The best Multiplayer FPS of all time.,1

I don't think there is much to say about this game since it has been said already. I enjoy playing it even though I suck at it. A lot. It's much harder than CS:GO for me but it has proven one thing: a game with bad graphics can still be good in 2016 ;) I apologise for my English.,1

"The classic action FPS: Counter-Strike, has made a huge impact on my gaming life, ever since I was a pre-pubscent,6 year old child. Enjoying various betas and versions throughout it's development, the game has evolved from a mod for Half-Life, to one of the most viewed and played eSports.   If you haven't already, buy it,play it and enjoy it. I have nailed countless of hours on different accounts I've had, and of course the non-steam versions  10/10",1

This is not a game I bought. This is a piece of my childhood that I paid to have back.,1
Best online shooter ever!,1
"I'll remind you: I've played CS 1.6 into oblivion on another account. 101 hours is not the full representation of my gameplay in this game.   CS 1.6 is a classic game everybody almost knows what is, at least if you are an FPS player. Of course today it is very outdated and not something you would otherwise play as your main game, but it certainly is something to take a walk through every once in a while - especially as a trip down memory lane or as a fun little LAN game to take your mind off modern games, which can get tiresome after a while (at least in my honest opinion.)   I can definitely recommend this. I played it a lot, and all the while, despite my review of it, CS:CZ had an end consensus that was a better smooth gameplay somewhat, this is one of the best games of all time. At least in terms of the FPS genre. No doubt. But if you were to play it today, you'd have to be patient as the only people still playing this online are either veterans, somewhat experienced people or cheaters (on VAC-insecure servers which there also is quite a lot of.) If you're lucky, you might still find that some of the best servers that kept the community going might still be up. Maybe.   Tread carefully, but definitely try it.",1
"The game of my childhood. I never get bored of it,     OLD BUT GOLD   ",1

"About Counter-Strike Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.  Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.  Gameplay Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.  Counter-Strike is a good game. I recommend this game.  Thanks Valve Thanks !!! Old but Gold !!!  10/10 From Me Sweep Playing this game since 2004",1

"I'm not one to criticise a game but, this has to be a great title mostly for it's 'Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role,' system even if it had many problems. The gameplay is great with plenty of user created content to play. Vanilla gameplay is not advised as it gets repetitive fast. Overall gameplay is a 8.5 out of ten. The sound isn't very good with it's annoying tracks, the only way to fix this is to download custom gun sounds but thats a pain. The sound wasn't even good in 2000 when the game came out and thats telling you something. Overall 4.0 out of a possible ten. I know this is odd for me to review a game off of this but online community. The community if few and far between, there are BARELY any good servers up and sometimes the community is awful. (still not as bad as team fortress 2 IMO XD) Overall 6.0 out of ten. Graphics usually take the backseat in my reviews but, I do have to say the graphics are OK I mean in 2000 they still weren't as good as UNREAL 1 or IDTECH 3 but they get the job done. Overall 6.5 out of ten. My verdict is that this game is good and still is I have to say this is a damn fine game earning my score as an 80% out of 100% (BTW This is all criticism because, I AM A CRITIC.) (I go into detail about every problem a game has.) Therefore I recommend. Monstercat signing out.",1

"There can't be better than 1.6 throughout all these years playing it since I didn't even know what's steam. Buying the original game feels way better than non-steam no lag experience as some of you say. It's hella worth the time spent it's been almost 7 years for me playing this game since I was a kid. My childhood and maybe later would be my adulthood also being spent on it. The amount of mods/servers are unbelievable! all of them are amazing as I tried them all. I can't deny that I am addicted to it but, yet! It's hella worth to re-born and be played like the past times! Tournaments and more. I can't withstand the ignorance of valve to it's amazing old games! Just remember that before cs go came out, your success was not in CS:S or CS:CZ it was all in this game. &lt;3",1

I went around on Cat Walk, Threw a smoke, and went to cut the wire of the bomb the Terrorists had planted. I almost cut the Blue wire, and it could have cost us the round. 5 Seconds goes by, and it says, 'Counter Terrorist wins'.   At that very moment, I just realized I had won the game.  That is my story.  Counter-Strike = Thumbs up!",1

Du ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!,1
it is the best counter strike ever,1
awsome game world's number 1 game awsome,1
"Oh,I remember the good times when I played CS withouth even knowing what to do but still having fun. Now we got CS:GO and CS:S and CS isnt getting so much love. If i would play CS i would not play it alone,just with a friend. Anyways gets 9/10 for making my childhood beatiful &lt;3",1
This is my all time favourite game. It is one of the first game I played. This game has been with me until now and I am still playing it with a big joy. It may be old but there is no other game that can replace it in my life.,1
Best of all times,1
Easy to learn. Hard to master.,1
A pure masterpiece of an FPS,1
"This Game Is a classic master piece. And has AMAZING replay value. As a young gamer my self growing up in a world where most casual gamers are xbox humping, cod playing, graphic ♥♥♥♥♥s. It is shameful that this game is not played. This game made and broke friendships and made a childhood for many people. Even if you dont play the game often. Please just get it for it to be in your library. 8/10 for some bugs and a now strange community. But nonetheless a great game.",1
the reason i started using steam :D,1
"so old, but gold.",1
very good game,1
Call of Duty™ ripoff,1
This game is ♥♥♥♥.  5/5  Must have.,1
"This game changed gaming as a whole. One of the best FPS of all time, if not the best. But its all about the gameplay. Its how CS plays that will get you. Huge online community, thousands of mods, nostalgic graphics, excellent gameplay, nice sound effects even if they r outdated. CS 1.6 is my favorite FPS and is much better than Global Offensive in all aspects. I played this game so much before i got Steam, this game is just spetacular. Even in non-steam gaming, lan houses,competitive play, CS 1.6 is still incredibly popular. 10/10, congratulations to the developers.",1

"I used to play this game with my friends when we had to do military service; it was a lot of fun pretending that we were fighting Russians while putting to use what we would learn during training. However, it seems that the only people who play now are Turkish children who hack and have bad ping so, I would not recommend this game any more.",1
"Great game. I have no words. The controls, graphics, and the gameplay are really good, especially for the time. It's fun, there is a lot you can do too. Would definitely recommend this game.",1
Highly recommend this game to all..:D,1
The chat was overfilled with people blaming for hacks.  I like it that way.,1
i love cs 1.6 but in this one there is no bots  ,1
The Best FPS :D,1
"2400 hours in 2 years, ruined my life.",1
Yes Counter-Strike ! The Best FPS Game Ever !  I always Play on this game it's super cool !,1
This is a very fun game if you can find some friends to play with. There are a lot of servers with custom content such as models or even game modes that completely change the game. Even though it's old there are still active servers with plenty of players on them. It's very easy to make a custom map if you wish to play one. Only bad thing is that the graphics and models are not that great. Also most servers are in spanish,1
This game is perfect and awesome!!!,1
Very nice 1.6 i like this game,1
Classic game. Love it &lt;3,1
Over 6k Hrs of non-steam version...And i didnt got bored.. Still one of best competetive 5v5 game ever made...   LOVE IT &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3,1
"While starting to show its age, Counter-Strike is a classic that you just have to play!",1
"Bought this game a bit too late... wish I would've been around to play it back in it's prime.  This game is simply a classic. My first Counter-Strike was Source. I loved Source a lot, and that lead to me getting CS:GO. CS:GO is now my most played game. ANYWAYS, I bought this game pretty recently and I love playing it. Too bad the servers are bugged I think, otherwise, still has an alright community. great gameplay and requires a lot of skill.  I love the wallbanging and the style you have to shoot. Not so much run n gun like the other games in the series.  I definitely recommend this game. Even though I doubt many people are still buying this game!",1
A briliant FPS game. Fast Paced Action. Skill Required = Good FPS,1
Lyf is 1 but CS is 1.6,1
"This is the game that started a genre, every shooter since CS has copied its competitive team-based style of play. Its the original to a legacy, and many people still play it to this day. It has older graphics for people who might not have an expensive computer, plenty of dedicated servers, and the core gameplay that is known worldwide is right here where it belongs.  But obviously you know this already unless you've been spending your life playing on Xbox and playstation. Right?",1
"Old is Gold, if you dont have a superior machine, no worries you will still enjoy the classic",1
"A Very good game indeed..... proves that graphics dont matter, gameplay does",1
"This game, is not a multiplayer game, is THE Multiplayer Game. This game is classic, is a monster! Counter-Strike... I love those words. This is my 2 favorite game of all time. To be good in this game you must be a strategist, to have a good team relationship, and takes dedication. This game has tons of weapons to choose. THe game modes are PERFECT, the other community gamemodes are even better! You like COD with zombies, well, this game haved zombies before COD, and better zombies. In what game are you gonna do a deathrun, where you must be alert to everything and to have skills to survive and kill a terrorist? In what game are you gonna kill zombies, while they run at full speed and all your teammates throw granades and shoot as if there was no tommorow? In what game are you gonna surf on wall? In what game are you gonna find this quantity of maps, and good maps!? In what game!? Battlefield and COD can have better graphics, destruction, campaing and more guns, but, they will never have the community that Counter-Strike have.    We made Counter-Strike, Counter-Strike made us.  (English is not my first language)",1
1 Word 'Classic' :D,1
Started playing this game when I was 8 years old ( 2002 ). Bravo Counter-Strike! ,1
BUUUM ! Head shot!,1

"The most addictive thing , EVER!",1
best game of all time.,1
"We will never forget about 1.6 , at its time this game was not only a game , it was a sport , a purpose , a way of living , i've been playing this since the beginning(back in 1999 or 2000 can't remember for sure :D) and i don't know what the world of gaming would have been today without it , so Counter Strike will always remain the king :D",1
The best FPS !,1
FOREVER THE BEST!,1
Its a good game !,1

"So many years with us, but still the best game ever. :)",1
"Will play this for like 10k hrs, for sure",1
One of the best games I played and playing till now ^_^,1
It s good game.,1
"Still the best FPS. Even after playing CS GO, 1.6 will always have a place in my heart.",1
"Great game, tho graphics are not nowadays quality because it's been made in 1999.",1
"The greatest multiplayer shooter experience I've had since Quake 1. The e-sport scene also helped it alot, it's the only computer game I've really followed when it comes to e-sports (back when I followed the CPL etc). The design of the game was simple but very effective and delivered a multiplayer experience that few other games can match. The Call of Duty and Battlefield titles, although good in their own right, never drew me in like Counter-Strike.",1
This game is awsome and will be for sure in next 50 yrs :),1
csik is for real mans,1
"Best FPS game ever, if you are truly a gamer, dont miss it",1
"This game will always have a place in my heart,I grew up with this one.It also doesn't require a good PC,you don't need to worry about ranks too,simple as that and don't be put off by the graphics...By the way you can still find surf/bhop servers so it's worth it!",1
This is s good game(:,1

Always good as a trip down the memory lane!,1
"Nice game, i recommend it!",1
"Back when Counter-Strike was good. Of all games in this series, the other games aren't as complete as this one. Though this game maybe feels outdated, it does pack alot of fun for anyone who is a fan of FPS games. The FPS function in this game is superb and it feels great to get headshots and so on. If you're intrested in this game and if you're fully aware of what you are getting in to, then get it!",1
Old school game.,1
"1999 is when this came out, but when I was born. Gladly though I grew up to find out and discover about this magnificent piece. There was no other game that I played once I purchased this with some B-Day cash on Steam. First time playing, I got mutilated like the noob I was, but when I started playing more often, I became better and everyone else can too.   This isn't like the CODs or Battlefields that I have played here and there today. No it's much more different. Counter-Strike is a Tactical FPS which relies on teamwork and tactics more than fast paced arcade action. You don't unlock weapons, you buy them with cash earned from kiling enemies, completeing objectives, or winning rounds although you still get a little for loosing. Think of the game as Cops &amp; Robbers. Robbers blow things up and the Cops don't them too.  On the extra note, this game has probably one of the best modding communities out there. There too much to do or put in here but I can slam a bit down. -Zombies Survival/Escape -Soccer (Or Football for the Europeans) -Surf -Bhop/KZ (Climbing Zone) -Pokemod -Gungame (Those new may have heard such from Call of Duty's spinoff) -And more, etc.  So now that I've explained the game I guess I can lay down some pro's yet con's to playing Counter-Strike 1.6  PROS -Fun/Unlimited Gameplay possibilities -Booming community that has been alive for 15 years -Plethora of servers to choose from -Competetive and Casual at the same time -Fun to play with a group of friends -More skill based than many other games out there -Cheap price   CONS -Graphics from 1998 may seem slightly offputting -Not an easy game to jump right into, as it takes lots of time to become better -May seem repetitive after a while  I came into CS late. But, I'm glad this was the first one I owned.",1

"After 16 years of existence, this legendary game is still in the Steam top 10 most played multiplayer games in the world. it's one of the best shouter games ever made !! you can't get bored of this one, trust me i have about 1.3k hours here on steam &amp; more than 2k on the non steam version =) but ppl left it to play 'modern games' like cs go &amp; battlefield &amp; COD .. what a shame !! there still some alive communities &amp; servers so don't be afraid ... but the sad thing is that there are many cheaters (you will get used to see them anyways, thank god there are many admins who can take care of them) i love this game so much but after all maybe this it's the right time to let it go. maybe one day i will comeback to find it alive again like the old days, maybe one day :) anyways, i totally recommend this game for everyone! don't be shy go buy it now if you didn't already do !' this is a must have one !'",1
I don't have to tell you what Counter Strike is right? The Steam version is better then a pirated one since the servers work perfectly and it got most bugs out since the days of Won. net,1
10/10 Would review again.,1
One of my favourate game.... :) ,1
Playing with people within this game made me a bad person.  Playing with people within this game made me reetarded.  Playing with people within this game has formed a tumor inside my brain.  Playing this game will make you a homosexual.  And you will like it.,1
buy this game,1
Awesome game! Never had so much fun with any other game!,1
"The best CS ever made, in the history of CS. World class game. Only skill, no skins, no betting, no random spraying, no luck factors involved unlike some games *cough CS:GO cough* :D",1
Nice game :D,1
"I remember back in the days when I was called cyberathlete. This game was so awesome with wallhacks, playing on unofficial VAC servers hosted by Online Game Cheat community. The player with best cheat was master of time. I wish I was that guy when I had a car in Jerusalem. You know three wheels and stuff with aimbot on the roof, freaky oh yeas.",1
Get in position and wait for my go !,1
One of the best FPS games of all time.,1
"This is not a game. This is a life.  I'm so sorry that there are too much cheaters on servers, but if Valve can make it better , it would be great :D Remember old good times, waiting to start a new match between Na'Vi and fNatic &lt;3 And all other teams... Then somebody made a cheat, and destroyed a game. This game changed many lives, many people. I think this game become the world best game ever. For me, it's the best game. I play it every day, but it isn't like sometimes. Now graphic is important. Well, it isn't. I know that this game is dead already... I want to get it back, but there is no way to do that.  Cheaters are everywhere now. In every single game. You can buy cheat for CS:GO for 5$ I think... My friend bought it. I asked him : ' Why did you bought that ? Isn't it better to enjoy playing the game without cheats? ' He told me: ' I want to beat everyone. I want to be the best. No one can stop me now. '  I don't know why are you doing it, this is beautiful game. When I played it for the first time, it was awesome :D Finally a game that I can play with my friends on LAN. And, till today, I'm playing it. I never downloaded a cheat. I don't need that. I want to learn how to play, to be the beast in the world... Now everyone is wanting money, money money... I heard about CS:GO Lounge aka CS GO betting site. Now everyone is watching matches because of skins, to get free money... Well, when I was young, in 2005. I waited with my friends a CS 1.6 match. It was beautiful. Now i sit here, and watch this CS:GO matches... So many people watch matches... But 90% watch them because of f***ing bet...  It will never be like sometimes... Or we can change everything...  Valve please, get this game back to life &lt;3  Thanks.",1
The best game ever,1
Great,1
''Fire in the hole!''  10/10,1

If you didn't know this game is the reason Steam was invented and for that reason alone I believe everyone on Steam should own this game. Edit. Nominated this game for the Test Of Time award because no game deserves it as much as Counter Strike.,1

Old School Rules B-),1
"Counter-Strike - a series of computer games in the genre of team first-person shooter based on the engine GoldSource, originally appeared as a modification of Half-Life games.  You have to compare, so this game I will compare with СS: Source and CS: Global Offensive    Pros:    1. Battle PVP.   The multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential of the idea of the game. The most interesting part of this is. Under the bot can already tune in, but not in the real players. They can deceive, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes.   2. The atmosphere and realism.   In all games, Valve is always a great atmosphere and I was impressed. It is evident that the developers have tried to do everything in this game, as in real life. For example, the sounds. Unfortunately, Valve released a patch in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with new sounds and they made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.       Minuses:    1. Cheaters.   Well, as without these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s? These sons of dogs prevent us from playing. Creators of cheats have always been one step ahead of the creators of the VAC anti-cheat. Valve is trying to improve its anti-cheat and have it turns out.I say that Valve do nothing, not worth it.   2.Graphic arts.   She was good at Counter-Strike as long as did not come out Source. I'm not picky about graphics, but after 30 minutes I start to hurt your eyes. Yes, and in general, this game proved to all that the graphics in games are not the most important thing.   3.Termination of support.   All good things always come to an end, and Counter-Strike is not an exception. The game goes more and more players, server empty.More Valve does not release an update for Counter-Strike and does not support it in e-sports.     Conclusion:     Despite the fact that in this game there are downsides, even if they have, but still this game is legendary.  If you ask me, as you Counter-Strike, the fond memories flooding back me, maybe I can cry .Game, which was able to give me a lot of positive emotions..  ",1

"I like this classic game! All textures,all weapons....I think this game was the first, and I hope to be still, the best!",1
"The original CS.  This is where it all started, 1.6. While many forget about 1.4, 1.5 and those versions, 1.6 is a great standalone title.  Graphics wise, you have to be able to run this. If you can't run CS at all, not sure why you have Steam. Simple, and basic is what a lot of people would describe the look and feel of CS to be.  If you haven't played HL original it make look a little stupid, but the game is still great inside. Original can't get more original here -- when talking about the base game idea(s).  Great for people with low end comps and internet like Link Freeman and his dial up. This game was made a while back so keep that in mind!  7/10",1

"Great Classic,still popular",1
"RECOMMENDED JUST FOR NOSTALGIA, besides that, NOT RECOMMENDED!  It's the father to the modern Counter Strikes and FPS in general. That's a fact, but that doesn't mean you should play this. We have CSGO now, it would be ridiculous to pick up a old, outdated and dying game like CS 1.6. Those who play it do so cause they've been doing it for 15+ years, but no new players arrive and it is too much blocky graphically to be even considered for purchase these days.  Great game, but too old/outdated and dying. Don't recommend, unless you're here to get some nostalgia from the old days. (I still give it thumbs up cause it's still a GREAT game and we can't publish a analysis thinking on the time we are but on the time the game was made, to compare it to it's days instead of current days)",1
When your potato can't even run cs:source. 10/10,1

"Counter-Strike was one of the first video games I have ever played and will always be up there in my list of favorite games.  I had just installed it. It was my first multiplayer game and I though I'm too new to play against players so I played only with bots slowly progressing from easy to to the hard ones. Then one day I joined a Dust II DM server. It was chaotic, but fun. I didn't even know the map then, but I learned it by playing lots of DM. I slowly climbed the integrated server ranks and made friends with one of the admins...then after a while the server disappeared.  After that I found out about deathrun. I was horrible at it, but the regulars helped me and I started visiting the server more and more. Apparently the same server chain had a gun game server too. Now that was amazing. Completely different people played there, but again friendly ones. After a couple of months the server chain was shut down...  I continued playing aim, awp, jailbreak and other mods. I didn't even play the classic mode, it wasn't of that big interest to me, though after a couple of months I stopped playing CS.  I can't not recommend this game, because I have so many memories from it. Nostalgia.",1
"This game ruined my life. It's an awesome title! I never knew a game 14 years old would be so good and still, it's active in the community! That's really nice! This game is a huge hit in the market and still there are lots of buyers.   It is a little thought for a guy like me who just plays non fps games.  But still, it is really interesting and amazing to play with friends and online too!",1

"I remember being a younger kid, I had a brother take me out and walk for about 30 minutes to a gaming cafe where they have this game being played 90% of all computers. Playing this for the first time as a kid, I felt it was so realistic lol. It was like being in a new world, basically. We came back to gaming cafe every once a while whenever we can afford it. One time, my dad came home early and we were not home, lol. Somehow, he figured out where we were at! Good times good times! This is one of few games that made my childhood memories.",1
"No matter what they do to newer versions of the game, this will be the best one.",1
"Best hours I spent in my life (arguably &lt;_&lt;), even after so many years I'm still learning... That's ok because that's what make Counter Srike trully special, the learning curve is so steep that you'll never get bored, if you're up for the challenge of course... This game is the true tactical FPS multiplayer, many new games with fancy graphics try to accomplish what CS 1.6 did and fail terribly.  1.6 needs more love from valve, it was one of the games that made steam a 'thing', hell, back in the day it was the ONLY game to bring loyal users to the platform, the games available at the time were very reduced and steam was just an annoyance, to be completely honest we all hated steam, it was a broken nightmare.  Valve could show some love for their baby... adding trading cards, bg's and emo's or even skins would be a great start... one call only dream.. :)  tl;dr: Steam was very broken and the 1.6 playerbase kept it going, valve should recognize that.",1
"What is there to say, this game started the insane multiplayer fps mania. If you are interested in custom modes (zombie mode, deathrun, bunnyhop) or just want to check out the roots of this amazing series of games, you ought to give this one a shot, but if all you care about is dust2 24/7, you should get CS:Source or Case Opening Sim.   9/10",1
CS 1.6 NEVER DIE :),1
nice game old school,1
"Wow this game is amazing its addicting,oldschool,ragers and more! Well this game tough me something... Rage and play I mean I play oldschool games and i like them but this one is the best",1

Still better then COD.,1
it's ok,1
When you play cs go always remember where you started! :),1
Been playing CS since 2003. Despite what the box on tactical ops says no really it's not better than counter strike. CS is the best first person shooter in my opinion. The reason 1.6 is better than GO or Source is because it's about player skill not graphics. The hit boxes are much better. In order to be a great player you need to know how to execute movement even bunny hop.   Best game ever.,1
Old but good :D :D,1
very much better tha csgo AND YOU KNOW,1

"-This is my opinion your experience may vary-  counter strike a name that almost anyone will recognize. Before I played counter strike I knew that it was a game loved by thousands even millions and that people play it every day.  =The Graphics=  this game's graphics are good (IMO) and it may not look to good by todays standards, they hold up just fine.  =The Gameplay=  The gameplay in Counter Strike involves starting out with some money to buy equipment, you earn more mony by killing members on the opposing team rescuing hostages, deactivating bombs, or plant and explode the bomb, also 1 life per round so work together.  =My Verdict=  I love this game the people who play it are pretty cool most of the time and the game can really suck you in and $10 may be kinda steep in for a game this old but it comes with  -Counter Strike -Counter Strike: Condition Zero -Counter Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes  wich all come in the $10 asking price and I would give this game a 9/10",1
this game will always be the best out of all the cs,1

"This game is a prime example of how a great game tends to pass the test of time. Although the graphics are very outdated (graphics aren't everything), the gameplay is good enough that the game is consistently on player number charts even after 15 years the original mod was released.  BE CAREFUL: There are a lot of FAKE servers out there. Be sure not to click on those.",1

"What can I say? My teenage years were in a large part defined by this game (pity about those hundreds of hours disappearing from record). This game is the reason I made a Steam account to begin with. This game made me love online gaming (even if it's a tough, one-way love). One of the first breakout e-sports (alongside Starcraft) and a significant influence on the FPS genre. A piece of gaming history. Play it if only for that, and see for yourself.",1

"Not much to say, really. The pinnacle of first-person shooters, that still manages to live on today. The community is not what it was, let's say, 10 years ago. However, this game still manages to be an enjoyable experience for anyone wanting a good old wholesome first-person shooter experience. Highly recommended, though if you haven't bought it until now, don't buy it, due to the lack of support from players, and the high difficulty of the online play.",1

If you have an older machine i recommend it to play, cause there are still many servers, and game mods active!",1

Awesome game been playing for years,1
"I still think this is the best version of any of the Counter-Strikes out there, and it's been a decade since it came out.  Yeah, it's lacking graphics compared to the newer ones running newer versions of the engine. So what? Just got back on it recently and I'm realizing how much I've missed it.",1
you can't go wrong with counter-strike,1

"Awesome game, you can get easily addicted to it.",1
Hard as f***. Got destroyed by 12 year old korean children.  ,1
A great FPS game for people without a good PC configuration ;),1
"Playing the original  (kinda, after the mod-play anyway)  CS game in 2015 has a certain nostalgia factor, bringing back fun  (&amp; sometimes bleh)  memories for those who played and supported it during infancy. 15 years ago, I couldn't have imagined Counter-Strike becoming the competitive FPS-gaming standard that it is today, especially with its latest leap into CS:GO. (Global Offensive, even while taking changes as they come, is the new favorite goose-- Carrying the Law of Newer, Faster, Bolder-- But even there, the core CS spirit &amp; experience is true. And always slowly evolving...)   It's good to look back at how far this franchise has come, as even with each controversial change or update, I know each decision is calculated with the desire to keep moving forward-- While  (hopefully)  staying as true to it's core as possible.   LONG LIVE COUNTER-STRIKE.  &amp; LONG LIVE DIXIE MAFIA. ",1

"10/10, enjoyed my 17 hours of this compared to CS:GO and their kids screaming 'GIVE ME BACK MY SCAT-TRAK!!!!1!' ",1
"No r8 revolver, 10/10 will play again.",1
Awesome game !!!!!!!! i have many memories related to this game . No words for this game really.,1

"If you love the CSGO and want to see what CS is like you will love this game. The gameplay is good. The 2 things that suck about the game is the people that play in 5v5 servers don't speak english and I get kicked not knowing why. And the spray patterns dont have 1 specific pattern to each gun, after the first 5 bullets there are 12 different patterns the bullets can go",1
+++++++,1
"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1
I`ts my first game i`m play with non-steam 500Hours !,1

I think every huge counter strike fan should own this game. This was the beginning of the online fps genre and was a huge point in online history,1
THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER LIKE EVER COME ON THIS DARN PLANET!,1
"Half-Life: Counter-strike has redefined online play. This game has more potential and more online gaming goodness than any other game I've ever played. Finding good servers is always a concern when it comes to online play. As perhaps the most popular multi-player game in town, CS features literally thousands of servers at any one time. You'll almost always find guys to play with. ",1

THIS GAME RUINED MY LIFE!,1
;]]] +,1
First online game ever that i loved!,1
"this game is perfect i suport this , i love this i hope never to die this game :D",1
"Good old times when i played this game for the first time. I had 5 years old when i tried this game for the first time. As you know, this game is a modification of Half-Life by developers and it's a multiplayer first-person shooter. You don't have iron sight how you have in CoD or other shooter games + you need to know the weapons because they don't shoot where is the aim. It's hard to explain, but this game has so many modes and is awesome because if you buy this game, you will receive Counter-Strike Condition Zero and Condition Zero Deleted Scenes for FREE. You can play a normal shooter games with instant respawn or without it, but you can also play deathrun, surf, bhop, gun game, zombies and so on.  Pros: +The multiplayer is great +The sound is good +The graphics are very good for that year +So many play styles +So many maps +The gameplay is hard but great  Cons: -Hackers -Players who will destroy your game -Kids -VIP Servers who will OBLIGATE you to enter on their servers  This game reminded me how was the life when i was younger, so many hours in the front of PC, how i played it with friends and at school, how i ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off for the first time in a game and so on. (10/10)",1
A classic which is still very much alive!,1
Its A superb game doesnt lags normally via steam i recommend to hav more plugins in this defaut game,1
"Counter-Strike has come a long way and to see this game really brings out how much it has come. I feel as this game is not just a time waster but a reason to still be on the Internet. But In 1999, I crawled out of Counter-Strike’s wretched ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to become the man I am today. And, now, I’m tasked with rating the game. How does one even rate his mother?  In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.  Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.  In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game.

thats a BIG DONGER RIGHT THERE MMMMMMM YEAH BOY,1
"I went from CS:GO to this after 1K Hours on CS:GO and I still think this game is gorgeous. I'm really sad that I started to play 1.6 just now, and also that I missed the 1.6 golden era. Even if the physics and almost everything else is really different and 'strange' I find it more relaxing to play but at the same time harder then GO. A lot of players don't even know about this game, but people listen me! If you love CS in general you have to play this game at least once and please don't crack it...you'll find only russians on that versions and everybody knows how they play at CS ;)",1
"Good game, would recommend",1
I don't think I have enough in-game hours to review this.,1

Sexy fps game :*,1
"Advantages: a good idea, an opportunity to play on a network Disadvantages: poor performance, graphics, textures, defects. Collection of my reviews on video games continues. Today we will speak about the most famous first-person shooter 'Counter-Strike'.  Igrushechki this appeared quite a long time, already in the year 2000 and won the gamers. Then all these 'shooters' were a novelty, and of course all like this game. I knew about it a long time, I heard enthusiastic talks about it, heard the word 'bots', 'contra', 'headshot of', 'ks'. And what is it, I managed to learn five or six years ago. Games then I was not 'tempted', but even then I have appreciated this game for three and a minus. Why? I'll explain later. Now the whole of the game. Created her notorious guys with the short name 'Valve'. About 'Valve's' I will say this: all of their games on the subject stopped 'fantasy' and 'half-real.' And this game belongs to the second category.  So, the creators of the idea is quite tempting. Confrontation of the law against terrorists. They gave the game the proud name of 'Counter-Strike', ie 'counter-attack', but that's just shock, as such, no intrigue in this game. And that is? There are running with a gun, a gun, a knife. Oh yes, there is another grenade (use 0). And you can take the shield (not a bad thing). We can play for the 'special forces' (which I did) and terror (very few people want). Most probably the main thing here is that we can play a 'bot' that is, our friends runs the computer, the computer runs our enemies, but we can play and through the network, where all have real people. Play over the Internet more interesting, but still 'stupid'.  I do not want to talk about any reality or fiction, but all I will say. I have not seen, not in movies, not in life, to special forces, and the terrorists jumped as the 'hare', climbed the stairs, as if running on the ground. And finally, it is that even the slightest preparation is absent, the men can not hit no shield, no weapons, no arms / legs. The hostages, but here too there are, behave calmly, stand, no one is afraid of fear or cry.  So, I criticized a little, and now tell you about the features. Game modes are different, rescuing hostages, rescue VIP-a, defusing a bomb, knife, grenade. A quest we give money, we buy ourselves, that it is necessary, for example, body armor (a rare case when it is not worn in advance on fighter (in reality)). On the job, we allocated time, which is usually enough. Each of the men says that he wants and commands that it is possible to give no one is listening. By the way, there you can sprinkle a logo that can be selected in advance. Beauty is not gaining.",1

well it's counter strike....,1
"Lemme teach you about the Counter-Strike family history: Counter-Strike 1.6 was the eldest son. As he grew up, people came to love him as a good-hearted, generous man that was perfect in every way. As he grew older and older, the public came to appreciate the work he put in for everybody else and he soon became a household name. Him and his followers became very eccentric and stuck to the old ways. Counter-Strike: Source was the middle child. Everybody expected him to follow in his brother's footsteps but somewhere he went wrong. CS:S was a damn sight nicer than 1.6 and he was still loved by many but never achieved as much as his elder brother did, always in his shadow. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was the youngest child. CS:GO was the child that Gooseman and Cliffe became ashamed of. They tried to hide the fact that CS:GO was completely ♥♥♥♥ing autistic but eventually it seeped out and now masses have come to love him, even though 1.6 is the best.",1
Even after 15 years this is in top ten most played games on the planet. GG Valve.,1

"Even it's like 15 years old or more , it still leads the way for us , maybe not on classic modes , but for custom game-modes it's ... the perfect game , so many different ways to script plugins , ideas that attract people ... It may be underrated due to newer versions of CS , but as I said , you can't get the same , great and satisfying result in modding the game as in CS 1.6 . A great job , since 2000 :)",1
"This game is reccomended for cheap or crappy pc's!  Are you a random guy who is just looking for a game that dosen't lag, realy fast and great? You are in heaven right now boi! Counter strike is a great, fun and cool game that is great for competitive! If you get counter strike, you get counter strike condition zero for free!! That's right! FREE!! Despite the fact that the official servers have been shut down, you will have never ending fun and i may not be valve, but this is what an ad should be like.  BTW 100% reccomended.",1

"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2010 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2012. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1
One of the best FPS's of all time.  10/10 would play again.,1
The best ego-shooter ever,1
BEST GAME!,1
The best version of Counter-Strike!,1
"Words cannot explain how great this game is. Upon the release of Half-Life, I was privileged enough to have this game (as well as Team Fortress Classic) come included with the game. I played both A LOT more then I did with Half-Life which I felt no need in playing again after beating it and the multiplayer left a lot to be desired. TFC brought me many great years of fun but like so many great games in the past, it just mysteriously died out and now I am anticipating the release of TFC2 next year. Counter-Strike, however, still has yet to die. Infact, it is a still ever growing community and easily the most popularly played FPS out today and still will be for quite some time, at least till CS 1.7 is released (if ever). I began playing this amazing game from the day the much anticipated Half-Life was released and haven't stopped since. I was what you would call a *pubmaster* for several years where I'd just walk into a pub and have fun pwning noobs but for pure enjoyment. The following years, a friend and I got into competitive play and joined CALeague. The rest, I guess you can say is history. I've played many seasons of CAL and yes, I've been out of CAL-O for several seasons (only played open for two seasons).  All in all, this game is still easily the best FPS out there even after 7 years. Pick it up, and you won't be disappointed. Do not be fooled about CS: Source, thinking it is better or that it is the future of Counter-Strike simply because it is newer. It's a really, really bad game.",1

"cs 1.6 is love, cs 1.6 is life.",1
Good game cs 1.6 but steam make back cs beta V1.4  and make new maps beta maps and skins Beacuse the betamaps so good for cs go and cs 1.6  I just like this game but the maps are not fun make more plz  I thinks its good idia.:),1
"this game is juste, simply, clearly perfect, no game could ever get any close to it, i have CS:GO and yet i enjoy a lot more cs 1.6 then CS:GO  good points: - a classic but amazing gameplay suited for thousands and thousands of fun playing - a load of modifications and moded servers with a multitude of skins for best looking game possible (like Zm mod,ZE or BaseBuilder....) - low requirements for it, but yet it allows to play with soooo many people on internet on many servers, as anybody could run this game - very amazing low download size making it pretty much portable (400~Mb of download is still much less then other games) - and ofc, the nice spent hours with friends killing each others as well as working together (RIP to old friendships broken by this game too :P) - diversity of communities to enjoy a sociable envirement and getting new friends Bad points: - graphisme are not good for those who are getting used to nowadays games (some people might overcome this point by simply loving the simplicity of the game) - presence of annoying cheaters on servers and the small management of such problems - no single player mode and even if you fight bots, its not fun.  i think thats all for my review, i've been playing this game for like 4 years now and i still freaking enjoy it and i really recommand it to anyone with powerfull and low pc, it creates unbreakable friendship relations :v",1
well i dont own the game and i can still review it so there valve i review it,1
"I love this game.  All of my teammates always say nice things about me. They never tell me they slept with my mom. And the best part about my teammates is that if I get bored of them, I can reroll new friends and even give them cute names. I can even convince the other team to only use knives while I mow them down with machinegun fire. My teammates even protect me and use their body as bullet fodder. And if I get mad? I just type something in the screen and they all die for me so I can win.  It's the happiest and friendliest game on earth.",1
I love this game it's a wenderfull,1
"Been over 15 years and it's still alive. Never tired of playing it. Original gameplay has been great already and now with mods created by players. CS never dies, it respawns.",1

My Fovourite Game,1
  This is Amazing Game I Love It I am Playing Since 2009 :),1
"There's been a lot said about this game already, so...I'll say some more anyway, both about this entry and about the entire series.  Counter-Strike was created as a modification for  Half-Life  and quickly took on a life of its own, eventually meriting a standalone release by Valve. Its development process more or less invented the concept of the public beta. At one point around its public release, Internet traffic for the original surpassed the entire traffic output of Italy. The game itself across all its iterations can be described as easy to learn yet hard to master, like so many good games. Unlike chess and  go  however, CS primarily revolves around shooting people.  On the surface, it's simple. Counter-terrorists must stop terrorists from planting a bomb at a strategic location, or rescue hostages that the terrorists are holding. There's a handful of other modes included with the original, but they're almost never played. Players earn money over each round (more for winning and killing) to purchase more suitable guns and equipment.  In practice, rounds can sometimes end with one team being killed before any objectives can be seen to. Apart from a couple of series quirks that people have learned to love - or exploit, if they're Actual Pro Gamers(tm) - CS is pretty realistic. One shot, one kill and all of that. (No real story either, either explicit or in subtext.)   One thing CS has going for it that I haven't seen mentioned much is that you can play in bite-sized chunks if you want to. As far as I know, the reasons for it not being mentioned much are that the latest game ( Global Offensive ) has a competitive mode that encourages playing for entire matches, and that more dedicated players will often play for hours. Strictly speaking, I recommend playing in chunks: CS can get tense and difficult depending on your skill and the skill of your opposition.  However, the pacing is such that it's not exactly the hyperactive bulletfest most of today's shooters are: matches can end up as deadly games of cat and mouse as often as they erupt into firefights. Related is the fact that there is no prestige (apart from matchmaking rankings in Global Offensive) or killstreaks or what have you for players to literally level the playing field with. It can be frustrating to miss an opponent's head by a hair only for them to not miss in turn, or to be oneshotted out of the blue, but it's reassuring to know that skill is the primary factor here.  Another interesting thing is the individualism you usually see on display. Most players, especially Real Pro Gamers(tm), place a high emphasis on very skilled aiming, but a well-coordinated team that knows how to position themselves on a given map will generally have a big advantage against a team of lone wolf headshotters. CS doesn't exactly encourage team play or punish a lack of it like  Insurgency , but I will. (Encourage it, not punish the lack of it. (Much.))   This particular entry in the series still holds up; its aesthetic is more classic than dated, and you get the no-frills base gameplay that made the series what it is. If you're looking to get into the series I would still recommend  Source  or the cheaper, more modern (albeit probably more toxic) Global Offensive over this, but that's more a matter of preference and polish.  The main advantage this first entry has over the rest of its series is that you can play it on pretty much any computer these days, although Source is only a  little  more punishing on today's computers. There's a fair amount of mediocre (if somewhat classic) maps and no default bot support, but unlike the beautified expansion-slash-sequel  Condition Zero , you'll still find a lot of people in multiplayer; even more than in Source!  Please avoid Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies though. It may be based off this game, but it is bad.",1
"Counter-Strike is the mainstay of competitive shooters, with the kind of prestige the likes of Call of Duty strives so hard to achieve. A number of gameplay modes ranging from what used to be the highly popular VIP to the traditional hostage and bomb maps, to eventually leading directly to two now-released sequels and one upcoming release leaves plenty to keep one busy.  'Remember your roots.'  With simple designs to keep things tight and easy to practice (yet nearly impossible to master), Counter-Strike proves that a good shooter can stay in the forefront for over a decade.",1

"Albeit being over a decade old, it's still an amazing game. I have played it both non steam and on steam, making total number of hours played well over 1500 Counter Strike 1.6 does not come with built in game mode like deathmatch. Hence servers employ  amxmodx  [amxmodx.org]  to create new game modes and modify game experience of existing ones. Some of game modes that I came across are:  »   Deathmatch ",1

"Really worth buying it if you have some friends to play it with. Doesn't matter how many years have passed, you can always put togheter your old buddies to play some Counter Strike 1.6",1
great game,1
"This game is a timeless classic. It's one of the perfect FPS' that will ever be made. The movement, wall spamming, hitboxes, and map choices are what make this game the best. I've been playing this game since around 2003. Have played tournaments, been an admin for many clans, and strat caller for matches. This game takes serious skill to get good at. There is a huge learning curve, and that's what seperates this from other games, and noobs and pro's. The people who will get good at this game, are the ones who put the time and effort to learn everything. While the game can be a pick up and play game. Expect your ♥♥♥ to get handed to you, as veterans of the game still heavily play this, and they'll out shoot you 9/10 times. I have been called a cheater countless times in this game, and it all comes from me playing this day and night as a child, and my skills has also transferred into other FPS games. If you get good at CS, you'll more than likely be very good at other FPS games like Over Watch, CoD, 007, etc. Thats why I nominate this game for, The “Test of Time” Award. My friends think I'm dumb for playing a game developed in the 90's, but there's a reason for it. As I said, this game is the perfect FPS. It's a game I will play until I die. I can buy any new game on the market, and I'll be returning to this game shortly after. Take it from someone who has invested a lot of time in this game to get good. It's going to seem scary at first, as you will get rekt. But you will develop friends from within the various communities, and you will get better over time. And this skill set will make you better at other FPS games. CS 1.6 forever!",1
"I love this game, this is the best game i have ever played!",1

"Life is one .. CS is 1.6 only . I will not say it is the most fav game of mine . But it doesn't strive to be the most fav game of anyone . My fav game has to be GTA ! The thing why we all love this game and we all feel the urge to say this is the most fav game is that once this game starts , the human element takes over and we actually game with our friends ( and strangers) and that's what gives us the enjoyment; the feel of competitiveness and who is the best ; to be in awe of some good player and the list goes on . The game itself is not great but the way in which it just lets the human element takes over and be the silent spectator as we enjoy and have a good time , just speaks volumes of the greatness of this game ! The game is like a silent Guardian which governs us as we enjoy our life in the 1.6 way ! GG",1
This game is a proof that games do not need to have good graphics for it to be fun &amp; addictive. It's one of the games which gives you the oppurtunity to go online &amp; have fun with your friends :D,1

This game sooo awesome!!!!!,1

Still the best counter strike ever,1
"A fantastic game that improves your fluency in the foreign languages. Every server you visit has the charming alure of Mexicans and Brazillians; an honorable bunch of players who praise your skills with phrases such as 'filho da ♥♥♥♥!!!!!!', 'xiter!!!' and 'jajajajaja'. They are also very skilled players ingame; I often see a single player moving at the speed of sound, headshotting everyone in a blink of an eye, and getting all the praise from his fellow brethren, usually in the form of 'xiter fdp!!!'. Overall, I recommend this game to all individuals seeking to have a fun, non-hacker, non-english gameplay experience.",1
"Better than Source or even Global Offensive. Traditional old game that comes from another awesome game, Half-Life. You can not end your gamer's life without playing CS.",1

Best ever shooting game played in my life i &lt;3 with this game.....,1
"Its a great game, best for good",1
"In my opinion, CS is the single greatest first-person shooter ever created. Complex, addictive, challenging, intense, precise, and infinitely replayable, CS was the defining game for an entire generation of gamers. But be warned, this game is absolutely brutal if you are new to shooters.",1
good action game :D,1
"The best shooter,period.No game will ever come close to this one.Love it!",1
"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.",1

"When it boils down to competitive long lasting First Person Shooters, Counterstrike 1.6 is king. The unique money system on a two team map design is what puts Counterstrike apart from other Run and Gun FPS's. Many custom maps and mods are available, while still boasting a steady player base even 15 years after release.",1

My computer is real slow so this game is great for me. I'm recently no longer a n00b nor an ultra-blocking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I still suck tho. Gun Game or nothing!,1
Truely a game which signifies the value of 'Old is Gold'.... This shows that 'Graphics doesn't matter but Gameplay does'.... The Parent of First Person Shooting Multiplayer... Even though it's been more than a decade since its release but It's still one of the most favoured online games in the world. A must play for any die-hard First Person Shooter lover.,1
One of the best older Games.  Thumbs up for Valve!!!,1
Such an addictive game! (y),1
highly recommended,1
the best game ever!,1
THE BEST AS ALWAYS! :D,1
The Best Game Ever !,1
"A beacon of online gaming, that despite being a dated title, so many players come back to it because of the well defined game mechanic. There's no great depth of content, just a simple yet enjoyable platform for team deathmatch with map objectives thrown in. Years ago I spent atleast 1,000 enjoyable hours playing it.",1
Love everything about this game &lt;3,1
An old cs 1.6 game that almost every gamer played.,1
Old is Gold,1
"Not the first fps i played, but one of the big ones. Anyone new to CS can go and play the orginal and see how much its changed. Don't forget to crouch when shooting on this one.",1
game cool,1
.,1
"why needed to kill this game? it was and will be the best fps shooter ever, feel like CS:GO just a ♥♥♥♥ ...   i think the worst idea ever is the 'promod delete', thats a greatest game than Global :)   Im playing since 15 years, had 30+ lan event in Hungary, and i think just should have to use global achievement, LOUNGE (skins,trading,betting,etc..) and matchmaking functions, we have been a great geam what every counter player like, and want to play in any event...   the real counter strike will never die! and original half life engine is the best ever!",1
best of the best ))))))))))))))))),1
loved this game for years!!!,1
10/10,1
"Great game, best FPS of all time.",1
"I've played over 2.000 hours of this game and I really gotta say I love it. Counter-Strike has always been one of my favorite games to play, and the only thing is that the graphics are outdated, but that comes with playing an old game. Competitive playing is the best here. You really get to build up some teamwork and make some strategies to win games.  I can totally recommend it 9/10",1

"I ran out of spawn in a map called de_dust 2 running for b bombsite and got awped in the head, 1337/10 would run again.",1
Counter-Strike modifies the multiplayer aspects of 'Half-Life' to bring to it a more team-oriented gameplay . Counter-Strike provides the player with an experience that a trained counter-terrorist unit or terrorist unit experiences .,1
love this game,1
Not really know what to say...but still the best online FPS game :D,1

"Counter-Strike destroyed my life. I had been playing HL deathmatch, and was waiting for team fortress 2 (some of those early TF2 screens are still etched in my brain) I came across a new mod called Counter-Strike, it had just been released, Beta 1 there were only 3 maps I think and the player models were so similar that in the darkend corridors of Mansion you couldn't see who was what, so there was team killing galore, even a console command for extra money, but it was awesome, I'd never played anything like it. So I played it. ALLOT. I'd come in from college stick it on and play untill I was ready for bed, screw school work I had people to shoot in the face! Anyway I failed my A-levels and got stuck with crappy jobs, but looking back, it could possibly have been worth it, because damn I had fun! I don't know what its like nowadays, I did get fed up with the bunnyhopping AWP gits and from what I gather that is the way the game went, but this was it, where it started for me, and if you haven't played it once then you should just so you know where all your call of duty and all that balls came from.",1
cool,1
Great Game &lt;3,1
♥,1
"Counter-strike(1.0 - 1.6 not source) is one of the greatest esport fps games(if not the greatest) in the gaming history and is still worth buying today. Graphics doesnt matter for a good gamer, gameplay does...:D",1
great game. registry is awesome.,1
"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.  The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:  Bomb Maps: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage Maps: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP Maps: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion.",1
By far the best FPS game ever!,1
legendary game,1
I haven't played it that much but i can say that it's a really good game!,1

"After all these years this shooter remains to be a classic that can't be ignored. This game was a major turning point in the history of FPS, and this game is what made online multiplayer competitive gaming so popular.",1
"Best first person shooter to ever surface on to a PC or console. Counter Strike 1.6 is an old game but still very popular amongst PC gamers everywhere in the world. There are many clans and communities that still support this game, so its not hard to find a group of friends that enjoy playing. You can find various moded servers that include Warcarft 3, Call Of Duty Moder Warfare 3, Zombies, American Football, Prop Hunt, Paint Ball and many more!",1

One of the best games,1
"Over a decade later and this game is still the most-played game on Steam and for good reason; solid gameplay, controls, user-generated maps and mods; the list goes on.   This FPS personally serves as a model of comparison whenever I play any other first-person games.",1
"Best game known to man-kind. No enhanced engine captures the reality of this original. 1.5 was even better. Per. Head-shot boxes have NEVER been the same and since VAC I miss seeing the cheaters getting caught Red-Handed and added to the International blacklist. I still keep a black book of every IP at the scene of any crimes. If you want to experience the original AWP trying playing OP4. Shoot opponent in the hand or foot and they are toast! If you are still mad that 'they' Cliff and whoever took the silencer off the Colt I got the SOB back. Visit  ANTPLA.NET  to get skin pack II. Original was from ~01 and is still downloadable as General Sphinx Brothers of Steel BOS skin pack. I was there playing UK's Ganstawars Last Man Standing Gameplay type messing with the bots skins trying to get CS skins on Gangstawar bots and enjoyed how one of them was invisible. Sort of like a prank. If you can tommygun invisible opponent you are like a Luke Skywalker bad a$$. Skin pack II has the 'Starwars' lightsaber replacement for knife and the AK to plasma rifle from 1980's movie 'Alien'. The skins out compete CSGO any day of the week with 400fps instead of stuck on 30 same kernel. I got a duo-core up to 1200fps. Well I should not have shared the knowlege with other gamers on the map because next thing you know everybody was doing it on their own character. [AU] DeathWish settled it when it got to CS with rainbow coloured animated reskins instead of them being invisible. My first game was CS Canyon_Siege and I was wondering why we all were moving around as ghost spectators. I am not the Prodigy Inc SPHINX. I have only made auto-admin called 3 forms of punishment. It was for Admin Mod then re-written for AMX. Lost. No need for it anymore anyway. People still found a way to hack with it and fly around the maps prior to hook and vote for matrix, etc. Give them enough rope and instead of being slapped, killed, kicked, ban was in effect for short period. Essentially you mixed 2 words with lag and server and other various buZz words like gay server all these got punishments set fourth. Talking crap about admin was a slaying. Lag was a slap. It was based off Trinity and the server was the spirit. If trash talk is about the 'spirit', that is not forgivable or rather as tolerated and the ban was automatically set. That resolved major breach of security. Suddenly there is no need to have tons of admins. Most of whom were there just to exploit code often unintentionally, due to buggy 3rd party plug-ins such as STATSME.",1
It was the best game ever made before valve ♥♥♥♥ it up!!!And yes i still hardly recommend this hardcore shooter!,1
PLEASE HELP ME I FAILED WHEN I WAS MAKING MY GRAPHICS IN MY COUNTER STRIKE 1.6 I CANY SEE ANYTHING AND I CANT MAKE IT RIGHT I REINSTALLED IT AGAIN BUT IT DIDINT WORK SO PLEASE GOVE ME CHOISE I HAD SUCH FAIL AT PAST AND WHEN I CHANGED WINDOOWS AFTERWARDS THERE WASNT SUCH PROBLEM SO PLEASE GIVE ME CHOISE ABOUT IT :),1
"Counter-Strike...  This game is the reason to why I got a Steam account in the first place. I got this game six years ago from a near friend of mine. Everytime I was at his place we used to play this together in turns; he played for a while, maybe 2-3 deaths then I played. We had such a great time. But... the problem was that outside his house we couldn't play the game together.   At the time my dad didn't allow me to buy the game, so my friend ended up giving it to me as a christmas present. Since that day we played it all the time. One of our favorite servers was Eropid (HS Only). He (my friend) ended up beeing in 4-5 place for a while on the server.   Overall, I've had a great time playing this game, and still enjoy playing it today. The game was the start to my FPS gaming interest and since then I've bought every CS released.  I recommed this game to anyone who wants to start play FPS games; as it is a great starting game. I also recommend that you play it with your friends; that way you will get the most fun out of it!   Thanks for reading, and enjoy!   - nité  ",1

"Game lag spikes only when I have a headshot lined up. AWP or whatever it's called is one shot kill to the foot. Fire in the hole is yelled constantly. Grenades kill nothing. Everyone is Russian. I would probably love this game if It was still played by millions and I could figure out what the hell causes my frequent lag spikes. Pretty fun game though, great way to kill time. I'll be playing it more often as long as it stops lagging.  9.5/10 Would get killed by a AWP to the foot again.",1
The best of times and now it has passed 10/10 for years of gaming.,1
The only game i liked to play cool nice1 just disappoints me due to fps dropdown on flash light and smoke,1

Cool !,1
Cool !,1
One and only CS-game out there,1
"Well,what can I say about this game,that hasn't been said before? It's a classic. If you've never played it,you don't know what a FPS is. It's just an amazing game,created by amazing people. When those slow years of learning how to properly play pay off,you just travel into an another world,filled of headshots,screaming people,who don't like to lose,russians screaming at you for being a ''♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ NUB''. It's just one of the greatest games ever made.",1
Still haven't found how to buy mines or incendiary.,1
Nice game !,1
The best game!,1
:),1
The better version of CS:GO,1
"Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are great games but let's not forget about the original one, the one that made them, that without it, they probably wouldn't exist or would be different, this, this game is a gem I tell you. Now, you'll ask, why play this game when we have Source and Global Offensive? The answer is simple, either for nostalgia or to see how great this game was back in the time and where it all started, of course, the game version is 1.6 so it is not the oldest version but it does not matters, there could be many reasons to play this game, It got maps that aren't on Source and/or Global Offensive, It has a riot shield (even if I'm not too fan of this tactical item in Multiplayer games) and a different gameplay than CS:GO and Source, If you think Source is hard because of the recoil, of course, it's pretty similar to Source but it's a little different (or maybe It is just me) but anyway, you will get used to it quick, It's not like it was Arma... or real life.  I would suggest it to any Counter-Strike, semi-tactical, counter terrorists and FPS fans (except for those who are COD hardcore fanboys but who knows, you may change and prefer Counter-Strike to COD).  And remember this. This isn't the killing house anymore, this is real life!  9.5/10",1
I play this game since I was like 14 years old . Teamwork game in most of the times .  Solo game if you are pro . ,1
!!!,1
A classic game,1
"I started playing this game in 2008 as a boy in Sweden, everything changed from then on. I always remember all the countless hours I spent playing this game. (Note i played this game on non steam and a seperate steam account. I think the total amount of hours i played was around 2000)",1
This is the best game ever. Stands the test of time.,1
the legendary game ever made,1
Classic old school game. Still worth it! One of the first and classic FPS games EVER! I highly recommend it and even after at least 15 years there is a playerbase of over 15 000 people. 10/10.,1
"Great game, too bad its not competitive anymore",1
.,1
Best of the bEst,1
"First Counter-Strike game and the best in my opinion. Everything from models, sounds, game modes, maps is terrific! I recommend this over new installments in the franchise :)",1
This is one of the best game. The excitement to kill after getting killed is just awesome :'D,1
"Classic, never change 1.6. Pls. I went back for a few hours and man it felt good. I played 1.6 first when I was 6.",1
Greatest FPS of all time.  Nothing else needs to be said.  5/5,1
"The best game, 100% recommended.",1
Best First Person Game with low graphics Love it &lt;3,1
One of the best multiplayer games out there.,1
Excellent game. I have enjoyed this game for years.,1
"Once loved it, now, full of cheaters, VAC doesn't work like it should, people uses illegal CFGs, scrolls, scripts, ducks right in front of you, you were once a great game... 10/10 would still play it if remaining players didn't turn out to be such illegal noobs.  Back in 2002 THIS WAS THE GREATEST GAME",1
This is the best game i have ever played in steam :),1
"its nice game,buy it and make sure",1
"Its not a game, Its a LEGEND!!",1
...,1
"Amazing game, was great in the early 2000's but sad to see it die down. At least the CS:GO community has grown.",1
10/10 would headshot you in the face again,1
Seems that people know more about me then i do. (2k hours on other accounts),1
Surely a pick for fps gamers.,1
"the best , classic shooter of all times :)",1

"Since I grew up with Counter-Strike: Source, I can't give a full review on how I feel about this game. But concerning that I am very into the Counter-Strike series I'd have to say this would be a legendary game for me if it was in my time.",1
It's a fun game,1
Really enjoyed this FPS. Was the first game i played on a PC and loved every minute of it. Great for first time and more experianced players. Easy controls and have to say that the game runs very smooth. Will highly recommend it guys moving to the PC world from console as I did.,1
Nice game :D,1

♥♥♥♥♥♥,1
Yo game!,1
The first Counter Strike in the franchise and the community is still there and there are plenty of people who still play it and they are not toxic at all.,1
Great Game :))),1
"The original Counter Strike came out in 1999 and is still good. El Classico. If you can find a chance to play it, I would highly recommend it. Unlike it successors, you can feel and hit crisp shots that just aren't available in latter versions of CS. 10/10 Would recommend.",1
"I like this very much,is a good game!",1
The birthplace of a great idea.,1
"I haven't really played this much compared to CSS and CS:GO as I, probably, wasn't old enough to actually start playing with the GoldSrc engine in a competitive way when CS was super popular. I mean, now it's still incredibly popular for its age, but since I am now smothered with the creations of CSS and CS:GO, I will probably never play it properly.  But from what I have experienced - skateboards you can drive! I simply recommend it due to this!  (lol jk I'll edit this review soon)",1
I get sexually aroused while playing this game.,1
no you want sorce its all people play anymore,1
Nice game! :D,1
Nice game,1
:),1
Seriously Luv This Game....,1
The best old-classic game; walls are made of paper and you can cross with any gun a double-floored concrete but I rly rly rly rly laaik you CS1.6 ,1
"Good ole' CS. A definite classic and first installment to the Counter Strike series. It's worth a buy if you want to play with some Mexicans, Brazilians or Russians cause thats all that play this game now a days.",1
oSAMA,1
Very nice game. I play it since I was only 5 or 6 years old. :3,1
Can play hours on the game. There are better alternatives but for low graphics this is a good game :D :P,1
Awesome game  Most fun fps game ever TRUST ME,1
cool,1
"This is the worst star wars game I have ever played. There's no force powers, lightsabers, clones, droids, NOTHING. It's like they took out every element that would be in a star wars games. This would only be the best game if they later renamed it to counter strike or something along those lines.",1
I am glad they only started recording playing hours in steam games when i started working full time. I've spent so many hours in this game... Only multiplayer game that I played and still play from time to time.,1
10/10,1

"Counter-Strike! Awhh what can I say about this master piece? well, It's one of the best first-person shooters that have ever been made, still today you can find tons of peeople playing online! Don't be fooled by how many ours I've got playing this game on steam, I've played since early 2004, this game is practicaly my childhood. LOL You cannot compare this game to CS:GO, with modern graphics and ♥♥♥♥, yet both of them are incredible on its way. I love the fact that you don't have scope blur when you walk, the fact that M4A1 and USP have enough bullets. Love it!   I rate it 15/10 ",1
Classic.,1
"Even after over 16 years on the video game market, Counter Strike claims thousands of followers.  Guns feel just right Maps feel just right Graphics look just right and isn't outdated at all(Youngsters not accustomed to late 1990s PC graphics might disagree).  You will play CS 1.6 FOREVER. I'll probably play CS 1.6 zombie mode until the I have arthritis.",1
This game remembers me my childhood :) Best fps ever :),1
  Best game for all time!!,1
"The game is so dead now, all the good servers have long since been shut down....",1

"People in this game are divided into parts :  The 10% : Complete noobs who can't aim and don't know how to plant  The 90%: Have at least 1k hours each (legit, I tested dozens of servers and almost all of the people with Steam here have more than 1k hours in the game), can ace with a knife     CS GO is a cakewalk after this 10/10 IGN",1

"Comparing the game to CS:GO.    Pros:      Variation in lighting (darker rooms), along with flashlights and nightvision.    No background/ambient sounds in most maps (clear sound) (easier to hear footsteps and gunfire).    You can wallbang most things/walls in most maps.    Buying amunition (more depth in economical strategy).    MP5 ('nuff said)    Movement is much smoother and bunnyhopping is much more consistant and fluent, you feel much heavier in cs:go.    You can run the game on a toaster.    Character selection (I just think its pretty awesome).    Spraying (spray paint), boobs make for a great strategical distraction.    Customizing textures, maps, models ect. is great, you can mod almost anything you want, unlike in CS:GO.    No marketing system (skins), this one is a bit of a debate, personally I'm ok with skins (I've even spent money on it myself), but I prefer to mod a game rather than having to pay for a nice looking gun. Skins, simply put, are a way to milk the players money. Im thankful that CS 1.6 doesn't have this.    CS 1.6 has a classic/nostalgic feel to it, some people will like that, some people won't.    People still play the game, proving the game isn't dead yet.    There are many different and interesting modded game modes in 1.6 such as surfing, zombie, bunny hopping, jailbreak, deathmatch, gungame.     Cons:      Matchmaking in CS:GO is better, it is simpler and places you in a server with people around your level.    Grenade physics are awkward and hard to learn.    Viewing and casting games is much better/easier in CS:GO.    Few weapons are viable in CS 1.6, mostly just the AK, M4, AWP, Deagle and MP5    Sometimes bad/terrible hit registration.    Tactical shield.    No ranking system, personally, I don't care about having a pretty symbols with a bunch of arrows and stars, or having stupid rank names like 'SERGEANT MASTER ELITE SHOOTER PERSON', the only reason I'm putting it on this list is because ranking helps put players with other players that are about the level. In 1.6, any new player will find themselves playing against people leagues better than said player.    I did mention before that modded servers were great, but it can also be a problem, there are few classic CS 1.6 servers that aren't modded, most of them being deathmatch servers with 32 players, it's hard to find normal CS game modes.    Hacking is a issue in CS 1.6, worse than in CS:GO. It's harder to get VAC Banned in 1.6 and there aren't any features like Overwatch in CS:GO, to make it easier to detect hackers.    Servers can change your bindings and send you to other servers, this isn't a big problem as there are ways around it but it's still present.    The game no longer gets any updates, I know this isn't the games fault but there are still exploits and bugs in 1.6.   Some people will agree these pros and cons and some won't. I'm not saying this game is necessarily better than CS:GO, but it sure is a fun experience. I would definately recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games, especially people who play CS:GO. The game takes a while to get used to but once you do, you will find yourself playing this game for days. I havn't played this game too much, so theres probably a lot I'm missing. That concludes my review.",1

"That is a very interesting game, a very nice shooter game.",1
"This Game Will Never Be Bested, Still fantastic after all these years. Growing Up Playing This Game Was Amazing. The game that molded a generation. Best. Game. Ever.",1
"What i like in this game: Gunplay, good gun sounds and they give suitable physical impact, although animations haven't aged well ;) Teamwork/cooperation aspect, not very complicated, no real different player classes, but obviously a sniper won't go to assault tasks with the primary weapon at least Highly customisable, skins, sounds, textures, makes this game fitting for so many different kindsa players with a relatively little effort  Then, things i don't like in this game: Graphics, that's the only thing really, but the good thing is the simple old graphics make everything clear to see and distinguish",1
Hard and very fun game!!,1
cs 1.6 forever,1
"Masterpeice in FPS. Old FPS game with fun gamemodes, maps and community. Unfortunately there are too many cheaters, even Steam players started to cheat. But still an all-time favorite.",1

Valve and everyone else who made it thank you for the friendships that i created and how many hours i put it this game on my other steam i have like 4.5k hrs ,ruined my grades in school but well sweet memories.

Still an Epic game !,1
"This game is one of the best fps games ever. It's hard but it's definitely rewarding and for those who seek a casual experience in a shooter game, there is always custom gamemodes made by the community to play. Some of the best game modes is surf, bhop (bunny hop), minigames and jail too. There is even more. The guns is very balanced even though an AK-47 can oneshot if you hit the head, but that's hard to do.",1
CS1.6 so much good memories and still better then BF4 and CoD Ghost,1

"Hello,i have been playing this game for almost 8 years now,and as it seems,the game started to be less popular due to cheaters and hackers! I would recommend everybody to purchase this game and try it out,there is a lot of servers that use WH/AIM Blocks and are not able to cheat on the servers. Valve is banning more and more people with Valve Anti Cheat so yeah,keep up the good work Valve!",1
Nice game!,1
A classic.,1
"The classic. Although the graphics are an eyesore to some, they have a charm to them for me. Beyond that, I would say this about it:  Pros: Nice community Nice mods func_vehicle Excellent maps Great server variety Good gunplay Nostalgia Riot Shield Cons: Graphics may bother some No official servers No bots No source engine: This runs on goldsrc, resulting in some missing features compared to CS:S or GO, both graphics and gameplay wise.",1

This game is still on Steam's popular list. That says it all.,1
"Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this. I've got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP. And too all the people who will keep playing this game, all I can say, as always, GL &amp; HF &lt;3",1

"cs 1.6 is love, cs 1.6 is life",1
Its counter-strike...... if you play'd 1.6 back in the day you'll love it because its as close as u can get to an updated 1.6 NOTHING like source (thank god),1
Old but gold!,1
Been playing this game since it's birth. I have to say it's one of the best games I've ever played - still to this day.,1
It's ok.,1
this game is awesome,1

Brings back old memories,1
"Good Game, Appear Is The Best.",1
"there nothing but to say, ITS COUNTER STRIKE 1.6 best mlg game that ever lived! jk its not the most, but you know its really good! 8/8",1
Best FPS ever made for gamers with brain and good dexterity!,1
Good Game but is Hardcore to the core,1
CS is a must have for every Steam player.,1
"It is literally the granddaddy of online-FPS. Counter-Strike kick all other genre-mates in the but with exelent ballancing, skill on skill fights and multiplayer-action wich still captures many players. Iconic weapons, modding opportunities and a large community made the Couter-Strike francise popular for many players. A big contra is the many hacking and the fact that Valve forces you to use the Condition Zero-skins wich are not bad but don't fit in the game as well as he original skins do. It's old but that don't stop me playing the game exesive for many hours.",1
cs is the best,1
Nice game &lt;3,1

"This is a classic, online action shooter, one of the best out there.  10/10",1
Awesome game and is the rawrest of FPS you will ever get!,1
Best of the best game,1
"This I suggest you buy instead of Counter-Strike: Source if you have a slower computer and you want the game to work fine. Even though its age, it is still very fun. One of the best, if not the best multiplayer you will ever have on PC. If you have ever heard of rumors and what-not over hackers and and people who will kill you with an AK-47 from half the map away. I have yet to see a hacker in Couter-Strike and if your new, you will play on servers with less skilled people like yourself if you are new so don't worry about that. Great buy. Get it and enjoy 9.8/10",1
classic game.,1
The bomb has been planted.,1
"Simply My Life Is CS , Still the best fps game",1
Life is 1 but cs is 1.6 .....,1
Why are you reading a Counter-Strike review? You should already own it. Just buy it. For yourself. Now. :),1
if you want a first person shooter that takes skill. this is where major first person shooters started.,1
This game sucks.,1
One love from 2003 - Nowadays!,1
$1000+ for my new comp and all i play is CS 1.6,1
Would love to see how much time I spent on this game 5-8 years ago when I was a big player of 1.6 back in the day. Easily in my top 3 games of all-time! 10/10,1
The KKK approves,1
This game has the graphics of Half-:ife but is an amazing shooter. It has years of expirienced gamers still playing in its servers and... Dang it random person! If you haven't bought this just scroll up and press the buy!,1

"Now, what's funny is that I bought this game like 2 years ago, and sadly I have not been able to write a review about it, but I'll say, I remember like back in Elementary school like many years ago, I remember it was titled 'Half-Life: Counter-Strike', and during that time, I was always crazy about Military FPS PC games and had an obsession with them as a kid, and when I saw people playing this game, I had no clue but to think that this was some kind of an 'Army Game' like many other, but until I delved deeper watching people play it, I finally came to realize that this was not some kind of an 'Army Game' where you go on missions and do your thing, but turns out that it was some kind of an online shooter where you do the mission with other online players around the world, but when I began to finally get to play it back in my old elementary school years, I would still recognize it as an 'Online Army Game'.",1
One Of The Best Games !;),1
it's aweomse game!,1
Best of the Best  Master of all FPS games,1

"If you like shooting the bad guys then this is one of the games for you. When Counter-Strike was originally released in 2000, I didn't play it because I was like 1 year old. I play it now because of the fast/slow paced actions and the guns. There are a bunch of guns in Counter-Strike that you can use. There are little guns that are cheap, and big guns that are expensive. But here lies the problem with Counter-Strike... people don't even use all of the guns! Whenever I find onto a server, all of the players are only using the black gun, the brown gun, the silver gun, and the green gun. Even though there is a bunch of weapons, they aren't really all used much of the time. In the end, I play Counter-Strike because my computer is afraid of Counter-Strike: Source.",1
"This game is a very addictive First-Person shooter, which even by its age is still played by thousands of players and I personaly find it very relaxing to its multiplayer and singleplayer capabilities. I recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games which can be played alone or with friends, casualy or competitivly.    I r8 it 8/8 m8. ",1
"My first FPS game onlinr, awesome experience,best maps, overall really loved it",1
"If you thought people dont play old games anymore, you're wrong. Counter-Strike is still a game with LOTS of players playing, despite the game being 15 years old so far. If you have a bad PC, dont worry, because Counter-Strike can run on almost any computer!  With excellent controls, skilled players, good graphics (for its time), a big variety of guns, the huge amount of servers, the anti-cheat system, good level design (official maps), Counter-Strike is one of the greatest FPS of all-time, and I think everyone should get this game as it is cheap.   If you are a retrogamer and you never played Counter-Strike yet, you gotta do it. You wont get disapointed. Not at all.  I dont have much to say about Counter-Strike... its just so good... everything about it has already been said by others... what should I say now?   if you think Counter-Strike would be a bad purchase, you're commiting a serious error. Just go play it. Go! Go! Go!",1
This game has shields O.O,1
Surprised there's still 5vs5 competitive servers. This game is still alive.,1
Very Nice! Great time! 2006 best dreams...,1
My old hours were not counted but still is a great game to this day.,1
its super hard to play if you have played csgo before it,1
One of the best games of all times.,1
"This is one of the greatest games I have ever played, full of modifications, active and cool!! Can't say more.",1
sick game,1
Best game ever... fact,1
very nice game ! much better than the new !,1
"Been playing this game for 5 years plus and it isw still absolutely fun. Quite in fact a better game than Counter-Strike source or Couter-Strike condition zero. Great Gameplay (Scrims or for fun) Many mods I've played are quite good like Zombies, Trouble in terrorist town, surfing, and jailbreak. All are very nice to make the game relavent and quite new. I highly recommend thisw game.",1
"Epic and old-school shooter , the best in my opinion.",1
"For low computers is this game oldschool,but still GOOD classic game.If you have good PC you are playing cs:go. If you have a bad pc you are playing 1.6 😃",1
i tought wanna buy weapon. so press B what da f*ck doesnt work Buy key i check cfg file bind 'b' 'connect  cs.metin2gajik.com:27015'  it's like s*it,1
This game is awesome,1
nah u can rate this...surely cant...just awesome...the pioneer of fps gaming and still has its hold ..simply awesome 10/10,1
haven't played it enough to make a good review but it is an alright game from what i've experienced,1
This is a great game! Nostalgia! :D,1
Wonder if this game will get old...,1
The best game ever made by man!,1
It's like the most played game ever in the history of fps games.,1
I just love to play CS 1.6.. one of my favorites...,1
"Still a great game, worth playing for anyone who likes the Counter Strike games. Don't let the outdated graphics turn you away from this, who said graphics mattered anyways right?",1
CS1.6♥,1
One of the best FPS ever. :X,1
Decent game with low price!,1
Counter Strike is the most popular fps game we played in windows pc.,1
#1 Game that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Gamers off Back in 2000,1
very very nice game :D goooood job,1
Classic FPS,1
It's ♥♥♥♥ing Counter-Strike. What are you reading this for? BUY IT ALREADY.,1
Really fun and cool you should buy it it's really fun,1
The next best version of Counter-Strike after the now defunct CS 1.5.,1
Classic FPS! A must-have for every FPS player to explore the roots of FPS-Gaming!,1
Recomand!,1
"Everything from here onwards was downhill, but CS GO was like a ♥♥♥♥ing cliff. It'll never get better than this. Best FSP game ever made.",1
its like csgo but it isnt ♥♥♥ and you can get away with micspam and wallhacks and all kinds of goofy mods without valve forcing you to use viewmodels so you can see their fancy skins,1
"Endless fun i could end up with over 1000000 hours on this game XD. Everyone sucks at first because with this game its all about practice and trying things out, seeing what weapons you are good with etc etc. Anyone can be good at this game its all about how much time you put into it as long as you have some very basic FPS know-how you could master it for sure.",1
Hands down the best Counter-Strike ever made. It have the fun in it that no other game have. The feeling when u play for a example a Warcraft server. The time you put in and playing that game for so long. Don't buy CS:Go. But this sh*t 10/10,1
Classical... online gaming started with this game =),1
"The original Counter-Strike. The one who gave life to both CS:S and CS:GO. I first played this game when i was 7 (over 10 years ago) and i never forget how difficult it was for me to kill an enemy. However, this is great game and game that certainly belongs in the 'Top 10 Games of All Time'.",1
"You can't strike a counter, but you can strike other players with a knife. Or just constantly get one hit killed by enemies with deagles, ak's, and awps.",1

"hye, thats prettu guud",1
Was fun in the 2000's. Not playing anymore.,1
Best shooting game ever!,1
"People are like 'Bad Community' but its because they wernt here about 10+ years ago, when the community would help you with anything you needed. It's a good classic :^)",1
A cheap and simple FPS shooter. 10/10,1
Was ♥♥♥♥♥ by Mexicans on the only servers that have players called hacker whenever I killed someone  Learning Spanish through this game is better than actually taking a language course in school 10/10 classic game,1
Classic and yet still the one of the most entertaining FPS-style shooters that has ever set foot on earth. Gameplay mechanics are fun and yet challenging. Game provides many different gamemodes from regular deathmatch-bomb plant mission to platformer style of gamemodes. Overall an awesome game and I recommend it to anyone who has any cs experience or has any interest in FPS-shooters :),1
Ahhh! Good old memories..,1
Is an nice game,1
"Im a CSGO guy so i was skeptical when i played this, but its really fun and mirrors my favorite game in the series well 8.5/10 cuz u cant beat the GO (srry if im ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ppls off, i love this game too)",1
Does this even need a real review?,1
"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1
BEST CS EVA,1
"Have been playing this game whole my life (since 2009), played many other games including CSGO and still playing most of the time and will play in future. BEST GAME EVERRR..",1
Best game ever can't believe it's still alive.,1
In my opinion Cs 1.6 is the best shooter game ever.,1
"Counter-Strike is only available to play in multiplayer; no bots. So you're forced to connect to someone else's server and put up with randomness and repetitive maps. And of course, it's the GoldSource Engine and all that entails.  Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is considerably more fun, in my opinion. You get all the same weapons, but there's a pseudo-story mode, AI bots to play with, and different objectives and a variety of maps you hop around, all of them challenging you in new ways. Kind of like the current campaign contracts in Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2.  Get this game (package), especially if it's on sale. If not for the classic-ness (or nostalgia), then get it for the great single-player experience with Condition Zero.",1
only kids from venezuela play this game.,1
cheaternoob,1
I love this game ,1
Cant beat a Classic... unless you just kill it with a bunch of bot servers. Still the king of the online fps.  For the record CS1.4 on the WON ID system (Way before SteamId's) was the best version.,1

Pure cancer i like it,1
"The Granddad of all shooters! This game is the definition of 'Excellent'.   This game may be old, but it's still a great game to play. Also, its really cheap!",1
"Oldest Counter-Strike is the best, because people play 4 fun, they want to be better and better. People don't play to upgrade their 'ranks' like in CS:GO.",1
This Is The Pinicle OF ALL SHOOTING GAMES,1
"It's a 2000 game style but it steel like old school games. Low quality,low pixels that's the reason why this game is so popular.",1
Awesome game. Best fps game ever... you are gonna need some serious skills for this game.,1
Awesome game. First FPS I ever got good at and still to this day I can load it up and have fun playing this game. This game has a lot of history behind it and it probably the foundation for a lot of the new FPS most notably CoD(Call of Duty). Thanks to this game I learned how to play an FPS properly and will alway enjoy playing this game no matter how old it is!,1
buy this if you are a winner,1
"the best game in the world, a child ♥",1
"Even though CS go has taken over cs 1.6 , 1.6 will always remain in my heart , the Bhop , the mp5 sound , buying ammo and the most favourite the elite crew model :D &lt;3 . I love this game .",1

Pretty much the best FPS evar!,1
So many memories about this game...jeez,1
This game never gets old. The only thing you can improve is your skill 10/10.,1
One of the best oldschool FPS games ever!,1
The classic which is Counter-Strike.  A game that has been a platform for many competitive FPS games. Also a platform to E-Sports becoming prevalent in popular culture.   Buy this game and reminisce of what CS once was.   It is perfect and it works every time.,1

"If you like classics, here is something you should probably get. A mod from half-life released one year after half-life it is still one of the most played games in the world bringing players from all over the place to enjoy together. It has a rather simple gameplay and you're able to get most of it in a few minutes but at the same time it requires training if you want to be able to play well.",1

There was swearing, and people started spray painting on the walls and people were getting headshots by switching from one gun to a sniper rifle really fast. Then some idiot lobbed a grenade at me and blew me up. Now that I'm in Hostage Heaven I have plenty of time to slack off and not do my job.",1
Recommended,1
This game is a classic. I lost many hours of sleep and spent a lot of time playing this game from the 1.1-1.6 clients of this game. 1.3 will ALWAYS Have a place as my favorite time i played the game. Still love to pub with friends.,1
I love this game because way to give headshots better than cs go and sometimes players in the severs calling me hacker if they dead by me Imfaoo😉😘🇺🇿🙏🇺🇸,1
Played.,1

Well i played my first game got in a lobby FULL of cheaters every single server a cheater. Other then CHEATERS its a Fine- !! game,1
An amazing game with an abundance of hacks to choose from for those that want more from their games.,1
"Old classic - if you starting with Counter-Strike adventure, start with 1.6 - it's a good start 'From Zero to Hero!'",1
This game is fun. It have got bad graphic but that is ok . I recommend It.,1

another one bites de_dust,1
"I do believe this was the first FPS game I ever played and I remembered I really enjoyed it. This was the game who started e-sport growing, with players as Heaton, get_right, etc, and you can really tell how it has embarked the industry and media. CS is the top e-sport game in the world. There is reasons for that!  Great gameplay, voice, maps, gamemodes, servers and many fun things to explore in this old FPS game.   If you want to play serious or just want to have a fun, this game has it. I'd recommend to buy it if you want to be apart and feel like you own something that has revolutionize the gaming industry and the e-sport genre.   Or you could just buy CS:GO, that'll work aswell.. ;)  ",1
The best game there was and there will be! Great balance and impressive legendary games.,1
Was even great in Early Access.,1
very good game trust me i been in this business for years.,1
What i can say ? Just lovely classic counter strike. :) You are not player if you haven't played too mutch hours on non-steam.,1

Good game gave me a good giggle :),1

"This is what todays FPS games are based on, in one way or another. If the community was as big today as back in 2004 than this would no doubt be ahead of alot of other skill based (reaction times, sound direction skill) FPS games. I would certainly suggest this game above others.  The only negative is ofc the age of this game. This game is about how good you are, not about how fancy it looks.",1
Great game.,1
The best classic FPS game !!! &lt;3,1
"Just recently started playing this game. But so far it is so much fun, have not played it with friends yet but when I do it will be 10 more times the fun.",1
The Best :D,1
"oldest in the class, still the best.",1
must-have if you're a FPS fan. This game has started it all.,1
"Back to the classics! Never forgetting the thousands of hours I played this game, looking through every mod and searching for tons of unofficial versions of the game, because I couldn't afford it. I started playing 5v5s in Source and now I am searching for PUGs in 1.6 too. It will be so fun when I find some!",1
The Best GAME ever! &lt;3,1
One of the best games ever made ;) Definitely in FPS' Hall of Fame.,1
The first game I ever played... And I'm damn right GLAD it was the first game I ever played. Nostalgia...,1
The best game valve made after Cs:Go but the updates made the game very poor :( wish it could be like in the past,1
hate this ♥♥♥♥.,1
Good game.Classic's !,1
One of the best games ever!,1
10/10 would play again!,1
Admin will ban players and support hackers.   Best game I've ever played.,1
I really like this game.It's old but so good!,1
I have played this game for 10 years now since I was 6. It was not on my Steam until last year due to using nonsteam version which I regret. But hey I was little. I still play it even though I moved on to G.O this game is still fun to play with friends or in mixes/pugs. I believe this game was and is one of the best FPS games out there and there is no reason for you not to buy it. Enjoy.,1
Best FPS of all time.,1
Ruined my life. IMHO best online FPS shooter game ever made. 10/10 would start playing again.,1
Very addictive game 😃,1
"if you are an fps gamer aged 25 and up, then chances are you played counterstrike 1.6 excelled at it and was able to relate to it with pride  this game paved the ground for so many shooters, crossfire, alliance of valiant arms, left 4 dead",1
Better than CSGO Why? Less Russians  No Hackers Guns does not do fast aims Less rage than CSGO But bad graphics and low quality 8/10,1
"i think this version of CS need BOT update, so i can play offline bots",1
I remember skipping school and going to internet cafes to play this game... good times!,1
Best of the best ;),1

One of the addicted games.. like it :D,1
"Invaded by ethnicities with bad computers and awful ideas with their server management, it is now impossible as of today to get a decent match without paying for ESEA, even in PUG servers.  Not being racist, this is what actually happened. Surf servers and Fun servers finally died around 2011, whilst vanilla servers that ain't running dust 2 all day long died before Steam even came out, and all that's left is a bunch of latino-controlled servers with ♥♥♥♥-awful maps and enough plugins to give you a seizure and a thousand hats.",1
"An Old damn game, but you know, Old is Gold. It's a whole lot of fun when you play decently but sometimes irritating on pubs, Servers with limted slots, like 15, and everything unlocked, trust me, with some basic understanding of the game, it will be more enjoyable than masturbating.  **BEST THING ABOUT THE GAME** The netcode of this game is perfect, is very enjoyable and gives decent hitreg even with bad internet which gives you lag spikes upto 300ms. ",1
this is perhaps the first game that I play on PC,1
What are you waiting for? BUY IT AND PLAY IT.,1
"I.LOVE.CS This Game IS SOOOOO FUN Too Bad The fanbase is dead for this game but i got csgo and cscz but when i hit Z,X,C It crashes So i recomend CSCZ",1

I love this game :D,1
Is The Best Shooter,1
"Being someone who played CS:GO before this game, I must say I was pleasently suprised. The gameplay was great, and the community was quite helpful and much less toxic. I love Half Life, and this is very similar. Really fun to just do some deathmatch, I find it to be much more enjoyable then CS:GO. The bullets go where you shoot them, and hit reg is not awful. There is a much greater spread of maps here then in GO, and they are all great. The visuals and core gameplay are so simple, while providing incredible room for skill, which is rare and something I very much enjoy. The only downside and negatives of this game is that servers are often empty, but the core mechanics and gameplay are stellar.  Great pick up even for us modern gamers. It will give you a little taste of history, and what fps use to be like while providing an excellent gaming experiance.",1
Counter Strike is a great game. Even though it has outdated graphics it still has great gameplay. There are different game modes. 1 is where you have to defuse a bomb or plant a bomb and the other you have to rescue hostages and thats just to name a few. You will definetley enjoy playing this game.,1
"First at 8 years, since in 2007, A friend comed at my house and installed me a cracked version of Counter - Strike 1.6 . Well I played it like one thousand hours , my friend moved in other country, and when I was playing someone destroyed my CS. I didn't know how to install it again, so i watched on youtube ,I reinstalled it again, That story with the destroy repeats like 2-3 times. I started to be an admin at 10 years, yes 10 years baby, I was doing requests to be an admin and i was telling them i was from 15 to 25 :D Well servers that i was an admin closed , get to the next one , when this closed , to the next one and like that. I always knew that servers close because there is a lot of money to pay to have one. At 12 years i discovered Steam. The first year I did't have any friend on steam because i Haved a ♥♥♥♥ laptop and i was not able to play call of duty 1 on 30 fps. I continued to be an admin on servers. 1 year ago I discovered an server that I love, I have some great owners that are very nice, and some day the owners decided that the admins need to buy Counter-Strike 1.6 . I don't planned to buy Cs 1.6 on steam because i already have it cracked , but i loved the server so much that i buyed it on steam! I think that i have like 5000 hours of play with cracked CS's :)  I totally recommend this game! 11/10  Love CS 1.6! &lt;3",1
Bought this game (CS anthology bundle) back in 06 from a gaming store in Lamington road and it has been fun playing this every now and then whenever there are good public servers for this game. This game introduced me to STEAM platform as it was a very popular mod of Half-Life. It has been worth every penny to buy this game and I still play it more than I play CSGO.  I get reasonable pings (&lt;50) and I am on MTNL in Mumbai.  If you are newbie lookin to buy I'd recommend you buy the Valve's complete pack during a major sale.,1
  Best game in my life!,1

"What else is there left to say about Counter-Strike. Are you a FPS god, love fancy knifes, guns and killing all your friends? Then this game is probably for you. For everybody else, us FPS noobs, this is a fun past time with your equally bad friends. Learn how to crouch, how to hide and how to be called a 'stupid, sniping c**t'. Just buy the game already!",1

One of the most played Online Game Worldwide.The simplistic controls and gameplay is what made this game so much successful.If you are New to the World of Gaming and want to start your career with a FPS Shooting Game then i would suggest you to start with this one.,1

10/10 Best Game With Good Graphics but need to update,1
One of the best games.,1
I still play it sometimes.,1
Played it for just a bit ...,1
" PROS:  + great gameplay + big active community + great choice of weapons + huge amount of mods + lots of community created maps, weapons, AI, soundtracks, etc.   CONS:  - rare issues with graphic cards (especially for laptops) - has replacement in form of newer CS games   Comment:  What is there to introduce? This is a FPS game that most gamers know and the ones that don't should. The laughable half an hour I have displayed here was just testing out the newly bought game. In reality I have played many many many hours with my friends. I played it in high school. I played it in college. I played it with friends after work. While the graphics may be old and this game replaced by its' younger sibblings it still holds out the test of time. While I am no longer able to get my friends together and play this , this game will always be a fond memory for me. And who knows maybe I will pick it up some day again. What I can do is recommend this game to anyone who has not played it or people who are thinking about pruchasing this digital copy. The basic concept of terrorists vs. counter-terrorists is really fun and with the modding community the amount of variation is almost limitless. So grab it if you can, it is very much worth it.",1
  The best game i ever play,1
The best game ever played :) enjoing abou 12 years :) thanks valve,1
  Nice Game :D,1
Classic.,1
"Best way to get a nostalgia boner, must buy.",1
"The first game that struck down like lightning, stole our souls and maked us fight with parents to make them understand that you can't PAUSE an ONLINE game.  I remember the early day's of playing and the less than professional LAN parties we arranged in someones house. I can't think of ANYONE in my hometown that did not play this game (BEFORE STEAM even existed) This was the game that brought us all together on weekends, schoolbreaks and we even went as far as moving large CRT monitors just to game. I would like to see the lazy youths of today arrange a LAN where everyone had to carry a large 19inch CRT monitor with them :)  All the drunken insanity of 20youths in a basement-LAN (NO INTERNET!), killing eachother and sharing files on DC++. This was GOOD times or maybe Im just nostalgic about it...  It stole my youth, costed A LOT of keyboards (JÄVLA AWP BÖG?!) and drove our parents insane. AND NO UPDATES BREAKING THE GAME ALL THE TIME LIKE CS: GO.  What you bought was what you got and not a different game every month due to updates...  10/10 would waste my youth on this game again",1

"This game was nearly the first one I have ever played and still is in top 10. Don't be surprised that I have so little hours played onto my account, becouse I am still playing onto my half-life version with official cd-key.(played like 1000+ hours). This game is totally worth buying if you like playing in cooperation with friends. 2 team are tying to kill each other with one life. Point is: Terrorists are supposed to destroy a bombsite and Counter Terrorists are supposed to defend it. It works the same in hostage rescue, CT has to take hostages to safety. But if you are looking for a counter strike and good graphics, don't look here. Try CS:Source or Global Offensive.",1

Very old FPS with an awesome AK-47 recoil (͡ ͡° ͜ つ ͡͡°) I play it on a potato at +69fps and I die cuz I'm noob. So wat ? Buy it and get me if you can. (｡◕‿‿◕｡) I'm recommending this game if you play on a Pentium IV with your r3t@rđ friends. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,1

"Am I really writing a recommendation for this game?  Counter-Strike  or CS 1.6  is a classic game which started off as a Half-Life 1 mod way back in late 1999, and was later sold in 2000 which required both Half-Life 1 and the game itself. Where as now, you only need the game itself on Steam.   Counter-Strike was one of the biggest multiplayer FPS games ever made, due to it being playable on many computers, and just an overall really fun game. It has no doubt made a huge impact on the world of FPS. Especially in the competitive scene such as e-sports where 1.6 is still being played today.  However, it has aged. A lot. Especially in comparison to Counter-Strike: Source. So a lot of maps are quite spacious and don't look as realistic as many would expect to todays standards.   I actually prefer CS:S over this game as I just like the feel of it more.  I honestly don't know why I'm reviewing this game, as I'm sure everyone on my friends list here has played it. But just incase you're that one odd person out that for osme reason hasn't played it - try it out, and see whether you like it or not. ",1
This game will always be played :'),1
WOW THIS GAME JUST NEVER GETS OLD :) ONE OF THE BEST EVER! EPIC!,1
The best game ever.,1
"Despite all the yuears that have passed , Counter-Strike is still one great online shooter that is fun and challenging to play . However be warned : You will be killed countless times until you master this game .  Final Score : 8/10 ( Great )  Full video Review :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap_HeTcwY2c ",1
This game is a HUGE reminder of why PC gaming is a beautiful thing.,1
"It's classic FPS shooter game which I have been playing since it's been released and I still play it. Can't let it go entirely. If you are looking for a game with many different modes available this is a game for you. Example of available mods(servers with special modes are available online) are zombie mod, plague mod, paintball mod, soccer mod, jailbreak mod, gungame mod and many more!",1
"remember ! if u shot to wall on de_nuke or whatever map, u will get double kill or annother lol kill on annother map xD fkin hilarious &amp; bay for noaimed pro players, this can be callled start ramp to csgo. Coz u dont need aim there &amp; csgo also.",1
it's like CS:GO....but losing isn't even that bad in this one. which makes it better. no ranks which is also nice,1
"As my friend says this is a game where you must use your brain and where you need to be a team player, not playing for yourself so I recommend this game to everyone who loves good teamwork",1
Still fantastic after all these years. The game that molded a generation.,1
Just a classic game to play :) .,1
One of the best FPS.,1

it's the best game in history .,1
Tbh after a lot of hours on Warzone my opinion hasn't changed.This game is great.,1
Since CS:S is practically a graphics overhaul of CS 1.6 all my good and bad points apply to this game.  Only unique problem is that is kinda poory optimized for systems with specs well above the recomended.  8/10,1

tbh this game deserve to bee free on the store cuz it sucks af full of cheaters.,1
Tbh after a lot of hours on Warzone my opinion hasn't changed.This game is great.,1
I been playing Counter-Strike since 1999 and its 2013 and it still hasn't gone out of date. i dont think there ever will be another fps game like it.,1
Classic! One of the most fun older games that I own. The community is still large and thriving! Give it a try!!!! :),1

"I actually have 4200hrs of play time on this game and started to play it since the 'Cybercafe'-times to play it against friends on a very old version.  This past predicted me to choose just one option. This game is greatest game, which ever was developed. Thank you Valve for your product. It has been stolen my childhood (in a postive way).  I collected alot of great and horrible experience on that game.  Storytime: After learn of the systemmatic of the game. I learned how to shoot. Located the best spots. Choosed the best maps(dust/2, assault..) and rised up to landscape of custom mods as been known the 'heart of Counter-Strike' It begun with Only Knife maps and bringed me up to Surfing, Kreedz.. And after hours and hours of learning. I became extremly skilled. This was the best highlight on this game for me, to stand on a point where you reached the point and can finally say You unterstand this game and his shematics ( movements, angle, strafe, and much more..)  *Nostalg* I might be coming back to this title ... maybe not today or tommorow.. someday, it will happen...",1

"BEST GAME EVER  It's Half Life engine multiplayer (+online) base first person shooter - Coop team game.  Great mechanics and great playebility with basic idea creates a mix of perfect cooperative first person shooter (nothing more, nothing less).  It's the one of the most popular multiplayer games on the planet. Over 2milion active players. Before DOTA2 this was the most played online FPS game on steam.  + graphics + mechanics + coop team play + online servers + different types of playable maps (kz, he, de, cl, ...)  - not as much players as before  Graphics: 7/10 Sounds/Music : 7/10 Mechanics: 9/10 Idea: 8/10 Story : 0/10 Addicting: 10/10 ---------------------- Verdict: 9,5/10 (that -0,5 is for ... this game is not so popular as in 2000-2010 ... such a shame)",1

"It's the year 2015. This game was made in 2000. 15 years is alot in terms of technological advnaces. You only need to look at the break throughs, inventions and so on to know this. So i'm bought back to my original question why do so many people,play thos game now, the graphocs look terroble as they would seeing as it was 15 years ago and so on. I would assume becaise it is because of how succesful amd popular the counter strike franchise is. But they mechanics, movement,graphocs and many more wouldn't be good in today's 2015 gaming standards. Do u just play it to try amd revive the good old times or to simply run away from children?",1
This game is still awesome.,1
"Classic. Never gets old. Great mods, Good times. Much wow.",1
"An iconic game, perhaps the best game of all time, please buy it. 10/10",1
"This game has the best weapons with hard recoil and very hard to master them It's a team-base game so you have lots of fun with friends or random players on the servers Many game modes such: Deathmatch, gun game, zombie plague, bunnyhop, jailbreak, climb, etc. Also it has a great range of tactics and many more things that make it the best FPS and hardest    This game was released in 1999 and people still playing it       I'll probably say the same for CS:GO   ",1
"Can't find any people who speak english. That's okay, because I'm Osama.",1
"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.",1
"The game is great. Has the full potential, the graphics and gameplay are doing it.",1
Great Game,1

"Never before has a multiplayer game blended all the elements of true competition and sweat-soaked-shirt anxiety as well a Counter-Strike (CS). You probably already know CS as one of the most popular modifications for Half-Life. It's been available for download for over a year, at least in beta form. But unless you've got a super fast Internet connection at your house, you may not have played it yet as the nearly 100 megabyte download may be daunting for those of you not fortunate enough to have a high-speed connection. Thankfully CS has turned into a full-blown retail game and, while the two versions of CS are identical, it certainly worth shelling out $10 for this stellar title...plus you get a few more multiplayer goodies in the retail package to boot.  Let me start off by saying that the Counter-Strike pack is a stand-alone product. You don't need the original Half-Life to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is Counter-Strike.  There is a single-player component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. As a terrorist, you're goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counter-terrorist, it's your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.  CS is an action lover's dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike Half-Life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. You can't just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while you're in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.  It's the team-based tactics that make CS so fun. I can't stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensive side you'll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. If you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. I'm sure you've seen movies or television show demonstrating this 'Conga Line' style of infiltration. Well, that's exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. It'll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.  Visually the game will not disappoint. While the Half-Life engine isn't the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you can't tell who it is then you probably won't be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if you've purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.  As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your heart's content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, you're off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the 'wait and watch' feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you don't just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldn't have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.  Not surprisingly, the user interface is very Half-Life-esque. Gamers who have played Half-Life or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the 'Update' on the server page. First-time users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.  Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, it's hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.  So how long does the magic last? Well we've been playing this game for over a year now and we still can't get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! We're still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little school-girls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess we'll just have to get them next time!  In a nutshell, if you're looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. CS is fast paced, intense, and satisfying--this game will not disappoint. This is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of CS is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness. If you like to play shooters online, get this pack!",1

"It has been 2 years since i played counter-strike in my other account. I have at least 400+ hours in this game on another account as i loved it very much, As far as i know, I have CSGO now and i play that instead. I missed this game very much. I hope to get it again. This is just like the other CS games, You play as a Terrorist and Counter Terrorist. The objective of the Terrorist is to use the C4 and blow up 2 area's, Either one could do. A or B. While the Counter-Terrorist's objective is to Stop the bomb from being planted, If it is planted, They have to eliminate all Terrorist and Defuse the bomb. It takes around 5 second's or 10 to defuse, It depends if you have a defuse kit. It's a good game and i recommend it.",1

"Counter-Strike 1.6. Not One of the Best, Nor One of the Worst.  ★ Good Gameplay ★ ★ Bad Graphics, as it was Launched in 1999 ★  If you're going to buy this Game at this time, I Suggest buy Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.  (7/10)",1
THE BEST GAME EVER!!!,1
"  Counter-Strike is one of those games you can just love, coming from a guy who got CS:GO first I think Source beat it by the longest shot in a lofe time.",1
Cs 1.6 ... That Game!,1
"This game is very hard for beginners like me. However, I recently watched a guide that upped my skill by like triple:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS5tRoVYFtg   So if you plan on buying this game, I definately recommend watching this guide before doing anything.",1

"Love this game to be honest, great game which has its ups and downs, base of my PC gaming career, best game franchise based off of Half-Life what can i say.",1
"epic game really , maps made by nipper are awesome u can drive a car also but the fandom of this western anime was really big in 2001 year",1
Better than global offensive &lt;3,1
"You have this game to thank for modes like Call of Duty's 'Search and Destroy.' CS is arguably the most widely-played online shooter of all time, and it's still got a thriving community going on 12 years later. It's got simple, easy-to-pick-up gameplay that's spawned a massive competitive community. Unfortunately, it's extremely stale thanks to the fact that there are 3 game modes. Luckily, there are tons of customization options available online. Still, worth checking out for the sake of history.",1
"Played this since 2003, addictive game.",1
:),1
  Still better than CS:GO.,1

"One of the best games ever, really atmospheric and fun game, but i have to say its dead now and cs:go is a way better nowadays ;)",1
" Counter-Strike, in all of its versions, is just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy. It's a great game and all, you just can't stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days without stopping from doing it. The huge weaponry options, which you can choose, the smoothness of the gameplay and sound of the game, it's just really addicting. With this game, I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). I recommend this masterpiece to all the passionate Action &amp; F.P.S. players who are looking for a good, cheap and fun game to play with their friends. All I can say, as always: Good Luck &amp; Have Fun! &lt;3  10/10 ",1

"If you want a good time, you'll play 1.6. Game runs in 1080p with insanly amazing graphics. playing 16:9 1920 x 1080 allows for the best visual settings. Although many russians own the servers, there are a couple US servers which has limited russians. Good luck playing this game with your potato of a computer.",1
The best game ever!!!,1
"It has FREE, unlimited custom sprays, unlike Global Offensive, lol",1
I recommend counter strike is good shooter and also a good game,1
"This Counter-Strike 1.6 is really nice game but however it's dead right now because Counter-Strike Global Offensive is out. This game might still play little kids and russians because its cheap and good. In my opinion this game was really good, but try it out yourself.",1
I have played this game for many years (dont look at my hours) and i can say that it is possibly the greatest game of my genaration. i have played every game ever and like it a lot thank you good day ,1

Semper Fi CS Classic #1,1
"Counter-Cstrike 1.6 is one of the best FPS games. You can do almost anything in it, which is pretty awesome, at least for me, when the player can modify things to his/her liking. You can choose from many modes, ex. Knife, Awp, Aim, Deathmatch, Surf, KreedZ, Zombie, CoD MW2, W3 FT and so on. You can change models/skins, try almost anything if not everything. It is a shame that so many people did not see its potential, but ofcourse, the time goes on &amp; the era changes, but no matter what, Counter-Cstrike 1.6 will always be my n1 OldSql game. Frankly speaking, I reccommend to try out this game to any FPS game lover, because I think he/she will not regret it. It is year 2o15 &amp; its community still lives, maybe with one foot in grave, but lives on. Thanks for any reader &amp; his time reading this.  Regards,  iMIND™ ",1
"This one of my bests game, the game is so good. You have differents modes of game like a Zombies, Capture the flag, etc.  I recommend this game?: Yes but not to low graphics computers, the game looks like a poop in software mode.",1

"DO NOT buy this game, if you do, you'll never see the sunlight again !",1
"Get this game if you love repeatedly hearing sounds of 'Fire in the hole!', not respawning after you die and having to deal with players hundreds of times better than you when you first begin playing. If you enjoy a game of frustration with a terrible community who will look down on you for not having reflexes like a cyborg, this is the right game for you. Also, if you don't already have this game, you are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Please either buy it or leave Steam immediately.",1

Actually, if you play CS:GO, then this game is exactly the same except that the graphics are from 2000. But this does not matter. Gameplay is far more enjoyable then graphics!   And if steam was built aound this game, well, then it must be some good stuff.",1

"A wise man once told me 'Maybe you should load up some Counter-Strike 1.6 and ♥♥♥♥ around on some pub servers for a bit.'. And that was what I did. And it was good.  Then I entered a server with a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plebs. Sometimes there would be a player or two that could challenge me and we'd have fun little fights. We'd make jokes back and forth with the radio but when I started asking for nude ♥♥♥ pics (no homo), the dude didn't respond ;_; . Two hours later, I noticed a player wouldn't stop trying to jump on a single ledge. Failing, he would back up and then try again and again and again without end and never shot back. I just sat there are watched him. That was when I realized the entire server was just bots and my conversations were with the rare amount of human players. Didn't know what to think. ",1

It's very fun but bit serious if you can ask me.. this game made me very serious at some period of time but the gameplay is still pretty fun.. and to derp around with it.. such as editing it's textures and etc.. I've seen people having troubles playing this game online because full of try-hards or any pros out there.. well there's no bots included in Counter-Strike but you can go practice at Counter-Strike Condition Zero, it has bots..  This game isn't free and you have to buy it. I'll only suggest people who really likes Old FPS or Competitive Gaming around here!~ Game on mates! I highly suggest you buy this game for the people who really likes FPS here..",1

I'm playing in this game since 2000! (CS Beta 7.1) It's my 1st favorite game!,1
"Probably my most favorite game ever. The original is still so amazing, great servers, mods and tons of activity still!  Edit: 2016 Update, still amazing. 1.6 FTW. Clutch. Dying community, classic original. 1200 hours easy.. I guess? Oh, em, gee.",1
Still playable,1
Very fun game from the old school times ;),1

he keep me alive. is the best game ever,1
"1.6 was a revolutionary shooter inspired by some of the greats like Team Fortress Classic. There's a reason why Counter Strike is practically a house-hold name now, and why it's one of the most popular multiplayer games. Because it's a powerhouse of effective design and balance.",1

"Unlike CS:GO, with getting expensive knives and later after you finally figure out how to use it you get shot by a noob. This game offer's true Russian Language Speaking Lessons, I have now learned fluent Russian and somehow learned German along the way. It works like a true Russian Language Speaking (and German) simulator should,   8/8 m8.",1

"I think it's fun. Haven't aged very well, but still runs on modern computers without any problem. Worth picking up if you find a good price for it.  Was also my first Steam game, so what can I say?  This game gets 7/10. Still better than CS:GO",1

"Counter-Strike has changed a lot from 2000 to (present-day) 2015. Even with the release of CS:GO, Counter-Strike 1.6 still remains a favorite for me. There are still many dedicated servers with ten or more people in them. The graphics are outdated of course, especially in maps like nuke, but they still look decent on a few maps . This game is the beggining of one of the game series out there. I would give this game 8/10 and would reccomend this to any retro-style gamer! ;)",1

best shooter of all times,1

"A classic. That is the best way i can describe this game, but if you only played CSGO or even CSS and then you decide to go on a nostalgia trip to test the game, prepare to feel like you are in a very alien environment. The 2 hours that i tried, yes tried, to play the game were filled with learning the controls, adapt to the different recoil and aiming system in geral and then dying over and over again by the more experienced players  I recommend the game if you want to expand your gaming history horizons and give it a try, but you can expect frustration and rage. Its a piece of gaming history and it should be preserved as such, but new gamers will probably never get it.",1
This game costs real money,1
The reason why you should be using Steam in the first place.,1
"&gt;Never used green text before.  &gt;Used to hate this game.  &gt;Went to a cyber-cafe to meet some friends, they were playing this game. Couldn't wait for them to finish playing, so I decided I would join them, even though I never really played it.  &gt;Died 100+ times with 4 kills.  &gt;My ego got injured. &gt;Got home, downloaded the game illegally then started playing. &gt;Got good. &gt;Bought good gaming hardware. &gt;Got even better. &gt;Got to my friends level (while they were getting better as well), then got better than them for a while. &gt;Nothing else really. &gt;Bought this and the other CS games, couldn't get into them, so I got back to this.   Now I hate my friends for stealing my social life.",1

Best FPS game of all time 10/10,1
"This game... Is great. No, seriously, this is an awesome game. However, It isn't quie worth 10 bucks, maybe 7.50, so either wait for a sale, or buy a retail copy and use the CD Key.  PROS: -Extremely fun -Balanced weapons (Except for the AWP) -Lots of servers &amp; players -It's classic -It's not that big, it's only about 400 MB.  CONS: -Learning curve is a cliff. That's on fire. -Not the best graphics (Can be fixed with a texture pack) -No bots  Overall, I give this game an 8/10. Now buy it, NOW!",1

"  this game never loses its fun old is gold they say, and holy hell were they right.",1
"Best FPS out there, no doubt. With so many different mods, maps and time it takes to get bored with this game, I just can't think of a better FPS game. Best of all, it's all fun usually - except when you get kicked from a lithuanian/polish server for speaking english or asking to ban a wallhacker.  9/10  ...because server list is so big and many of the servers are full of bots, only serving purpose to redirect players to join someone elses server. It can be hard to find a real server.",1

"Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.  Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.  What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.  Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check. Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.  As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.  The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.  It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.  If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.  There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.  At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.  When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as 'same old' to us.  This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.  And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.",1

"A great game of cat-and-mouse where you either play as a terrorist (plant bombs or hold hostages) or counter-terrorist (defend bombsites or rescue hostages). Either complete those objectives or kill all players of the opposing team to win the round.  Counter-Strike is a fast-paced, realistic shooter that encourages teamwork so play with a friend (it's also more fun). The graphics hasn't aged well but the guns still looks authentic. One thing I hate about Counter-Strike is when you die, you have to sit and wait until the round ends. Even if the rounds are usually short, it's frustrating and it puts a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive. Fortunately, Counter-Strike has tons of mods available so you're able to play the game in many different ways. This helps the game from becoming monotonous and keep the game fresh.  There's also not a lot of detail in the sound, other than the guns, but that's a minor complaint. The mods, dedicated servers and competitive nature of the game is what holds this game together to this day and that's why millions of people still play this old-school game. Although there are many better shooters on the market now, Counter-Strike's unique gameplay is what keeps me coming back from time to time.  8/10 - GREAT GAME",1

Classic game,1
"It's a great action game , my early playing game. I like the action, the maps but I don't like sometimes becase all players are buying AWP and then the game is so boring. If I were the programmer of this game I allowed only AWP on the team. Another thing is that in game must be a leader , to focus the action of all team.",1
Memories...  You can't call yourself a gamer if you didn't play this game.,1
A little better than Pac-Man.,1

The best and most original FPS of all time. Bow down to what has overtaken over 10 years of my life. GG,1
Decent game with low price!,1
"Decided to try it out to see how far along the CS series has come along and well it came from a rough beginning (based off of my experience). I couldn't find a lobby that wasn't full except for one lobby with only a single guy playing with bots in a TDM game. Now this guy was either really good at CS or hacking but i've never gone 15+ deaths 0 kills by the same guy. Another interesting thing to note is how the maps are vastly different from their counterparts in CSGO which isn't a bad thing just interesting. Secondly, there is a lot less spread in the guns than there is in CSGO a long with a different types of weapons...well for most the only difference was the name of the gun. Also there were more options for CT and T teams. Interesting to play probably won't play again but hey i need it for GMOD reasons.",1
"Even with the small amount of hours that i have i find the game fun, the only reason i have a small amount of hours is because i spend all of my time playing csgo.  10/10",1

"I played this game for 909131 hours, steam is liying, and I must say COD Advanced warfare is infinitly better than this pile of crap. If u want to be a proper gamer dont touch this low skill ceiling pile of trash and play proper games (actually only COD) .GET GUD NUUBZ.",1

I will remember it and never forget it This game is a legend and that's all i can say about it.,1
Fun and remerberable game what has the classic feeling of Half Life. Fun since start and worth all money. Some 'bugs' in the audio but i'll deal with it. I recomend to people who likes classic FPS games. 9/10 cause setting are not so optimiseable. ,1

Best online multiplayer competitive game ever made. A game with such masterful dynamics where both brilliant individual skill and team strategic ingenuity play equally important role in the final goal of triumph. Perfect in all aspects. Definitely won't get a decent successor in near future.,1

1.6 will always be 1.6 and the best CS game &lt;3,1
Its been 7 years i still play this game. I dont know why but i attracted towards gaming because of counter-strike 1.6. This game gave us many great moments in cs history. I know people nowadays play cs go but they should know 1.6 is father of cs go. PURE OLD IS GOLD !,1
"15 years later, still playing this game. Lot's of nostalgia in this game and also I have yet to see a game series like this.",1

Very good game!,1
"Made by Valve Software in 2000, originaly a mod for Half-Life in 1999. The most recently update is known as version 1.6. This game isn't balanced: the Desert Eagle is TO overpowered, USP too, rest of the pistols are mostly useless. The SMGs are quite good, but not as good as the Assault RIfles thoe. If you play this game right now, then expect little kids, russians, or just some wierd guys, who somehow see trough walls and always kill you with a one shot in the head... But renember: this game is amazing, alot of nostalgia for it. I would recomend to buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive, because it is more balanced, better movement, actual physics, and renember: you CAN earn money!! (when new cases come out, just play the hell out of it, there is a good chance that you'l get it in a drop)",1

"Exciting, fun, addictive - Counter-Strike is an awesome game, but I'd recommend buying Half-Life Game of the Year Edition then simply downloading CS rather than purchasing this more limited release.Exciting, fun, addictive - Counter-Strike is an awesome game, but I'd recommend buying Half-Life Game of the Year Edition then simply downloading CS rather than purchasing this more limited release.",1

"Despite my hilariously low count of, 0.6 hours, on record, I can attest to you that, nay, I have played this game(and it's 'sequels') to the ends of time. I've literally sunk close to 15,000 hours into the various derivations of CS over the years.  I found out about CS from some #IRC chat I used to frequent back in the day(it might have been an ICQ chat with one of them). Namely, I started with the first ALPHA(yea, not beta, ALPHA). I can recall the loading screen and everything. From there, I progressed through the initial betas, introduction of maps, and various weapons(anyone remember the OLD cs_siege, complete with working apc and sniper tower?), etc.  I then became a player in various 'leagues'; I won't name drop, but I was a baller at one time.  So, yes, this game is good. Some people recommend CSGO as the 'modern' return of 1.6, but I disagree. CSGO is better than CSS, yes, but still not on-par with 1.6, nothing will ever be :(  Goodbye WON-servers.",1
The mother of all fps games. Old but gold.,1
highly recommended to live no life,1
The best game ever &lt;3,1

"Incredible for a game released in 2000. Being the first Counter Strike game, it contains items, physics, sections that can't be found in CS:GO. This game is what paved the way to my personal favorite CS:GO. I would really recommend this game to see what it felt like in the early 2000s.",1

"The game is good, but not a lot of people play the original anymore. If you don't have any friends who play this one, stick to CS Source, because the few servers in the original that are populated are not exactly your standard modes usually. But a good competitive shooter none-the-less",1

Graphics are kinda bad but overall its a great game if it were not for this game csgo would be nothing.,1
"i love the game just one question, why did valve change the old models? heres the problem the guys hand model in the beta is fine but the steam 1.6 version his skin is to pale to be skin. the old player models were fine but in 1.6 they are just blah. the old title screen it looked fine in the beta it always reminded me of the map de_dust but 1.6 it reminds me of like a news report thing about to come on TV. the hostages sure they look better with the bland orange suits and the white suits with ties, but the scientist models for the hostages look better because for example would you see a guy in a orange suit in a freezing cold place like office? alright i think i am done with saying all the problems with cs 1.6 now",1
NO Words to express !! Just download and enjoy each second of the game play. Highly Recommended !!,1
Classic.,1

Hell yeah!!,1
"The Original that started it all. V1.6 is still the best counter strike around. CS GO might have is fancy new engine,but in my opinion still does not beat this classic.I will say though at least CS: GO is better then CS: S by a small amount. This game however rolls all over CS: S and CS: GO. Call me a puriest all you want but its still damn good and has lots of mods.",1
This is a good game i recommended to you. This game is old bath a good game for nolifers. If you play this i recommend a server Ladie.lt this is a good server. This server is of Lithuianian country.,1

+This game still have appeal  - Runs slightly higher cpu then TF2 does (Edit: V-sync on can reduce load by half),1
"This insightful and damning critique of the military-industrial complex deserves to be highlighted for its trenchant social commentary as much as for its streamlined, highly polished gameplay. This is a multiplayer shooter with two teams, 'terrorists' and 'counter-terrorists,' but tellingly the player shuffles between the two with ease and there are basically no differences between being on one side or the other, save for their objective, which is often to plant a bomb on nothing of value or rescue 'hostages' who disappear immediately when rescued, as if they were created solely to sustain the conflict. Both teams purchase their weapons from the same supplier with money they earn from fighting each other: endless soldiers fighting an eternal war driven not by ideology but by the military industrial complex, where fighting simply leads to more money and more fighting rather than an eventual peaceful resolution. The graphics could use some work. 8/10!",1
"Fired at a person and I actually killed them  10/10, already more polished than CSGO",1
THE FIRST IS THE BEST! BUY IT!!,1

does anyone knows this game? ^^,1
Still an awesome game. 8/10.,1
still better than cod,1
"At first a third-party mod for Half-Life Deathmatch, Counter Strike became one of the most recognized and accoladed FPS's amongst the PC gaming community, and 1.6 is still going strong with hundreds of servers available free-to-play worldwide, even after the release of Source (the newer version of CS using the HL2 engine).   Nothing comes close to the intuitive physics and control provided by the old-school Half-Life 1 engine. Clever map design, in combination with a wide (but not overly-acclectic) collection of firearms and equipment at your disposal make for exciting deathmatch-style firefights as well as situtions requiring strategy and coordination with teamates.   The beauty of this game is it's simplicity, and diversity of action: There are no classes, no upgrades or bonuses, and nothing giving any player any sort of in-game advantage over another, save for skill and knowledge of the game. A large arsenal of uniquely-tuned weapons, CS's worldwide appeal and player base, and a plethora of every map type you could possibly imagine make for some very memorable gameplay experiences.",1

"Counter-Strike:  I started playing cs when I was just 4 years old .  Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.  CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. 'Very Addictive Game :p",1

"Counter-Strike (officially abbreviated as CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, in which teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists battle to, respectively, perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking) and prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first version of Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification for Half-Life and designed by Minh 'Gooseman' Le and Jess 'Cliffe' Cliffe, before the rights to the game's intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of Half-Life.  The game was followed-up with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. Later that same year, Counter-Strike: Source was released by Valve. Released only eight months after Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, in November 2004, the game was a remake of the original Counter-Strike and the first in the series to run on Valve's newly created Source engine.[1] The fourth game in the main series to have been developed by Valve, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who also worked on Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.[2] Several spin-off titles have been released for Asian territories.",1

Among the other Counter-Strike games I have cheated within them, multiple accounts, and have been banned more than my 2 year old sister can count. By the way, she can count to 22. After been given the opportunity to try the very first, at least on Steam, Counter-Strike 1.5/1.6, I have come to realize that I have no need to cheat. I can play this game on a competitive skill and strive to be better.  Do I recommend it? Yes.  Much more to say besides it turned me to be a legitmate player? No.  That should say enough.

Counter-Strike is a game that I recommend because: - is one of the legends from the category shooting - is cheaper than the rest from the category shooting - is a method to banish boredom  - is a good method to increase your performance at aim - you can easy change the type of default skins by the skins from internet - have a fair VAC staff - and... why you don't try?  Enjoy!,1

"Counter-Strike is a tactical first-person shooter video game which originated from a Half-Life modification and features real-world weapons.  Counter-Strike pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing the mission objective or eliminating the opposing force. The game has both individual and multiplayer options. Bots can be added into the game. The online-multiplayer option is activated via Steam.  Other than similarities in basic gameplay, Counter-Strike is not in any way related to Half-Life. The original version was marketed as a commercial mod, but since then it has grown into a separate game in itself.",1

"Most think CS was released in 2000. It actually was released on june 19, 1999 (before HL: opposing force) as a GoldSrc mod for free. Later when Gooseman joined valve it was released as a retail game for about 10 dollars. Overall you cannot deny the fact that CS was one of the best games of all time and in my opinion it is slightly better than GO but that's my opinion.",1
"One of the best games I've ever played, having spent more than 1/3 of my gaming time easily on cs 1.5/1.6 alone.",1

"The Best FPS series began from this game, and it continue on. 11/10 best classic game",1
  cool classic game :D i like this,1
💯👏👌👈,1
The game that singlehandedly started the FPS genre on the PC - and we're not talking about CoD. That's a different mess. Especially around BlackOps3.   What more do I need to say?,1

"Hello people, i would like to spread the world about this game. Graphics kinda bad, but its about the action, eh? So, it is mainly based as a game, terrorists vs counter-terrorists. Terrorists have to plant the bomb,(at de_maps) or secure the hostages (at cs_maps). Counter ones needs to do the opposite, defuse or deny the bomb (at de_maps) and get the hostages back (at cs_maps). There are a lot of mods, if you dont like the classic mode. But i really think that everyone knows about this game :).  P.s. Im doing this for a steam badge :D",1
"¡Good game!, one of my favorite VALVE games.",1
Wallbangs everywhere. 9/11 would buy again.,1
"'Worst game ever, worst graphics' The graphics are that bad because the game is older than your mothers fanny and the game is awesome itself. Brings all the good memories back. For example when I was 7, installing the cracked version of that game and then just shooting anyone who gets in my way without controlling the recoil. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ and lol traded this game for some crappy AK-47 in CS GO. Huehuehuehuehue. I give it 8/8 m8. pls liek no hate no homo tenks. Oh and btw the funniest thing about this game is brining your CS GO skills there, doing 1 hit kills and then getting banned from servers for 'hacking' Like I've joined a sever once, done 7 headshots in a row without dying, then some speccy ♥♥♥♥ is sayin': 'wh and aim off or im banning you.' So yea this game is fabulous 8/8 would rate again.",1
This game is sooooooooooo fun special when u play the custom mods,1
Get this game is beastz,1
Would not really recomend because new players cant even get a single kill because everyones a pro but still can be fun at times.,1
Good game when it game out. Super Toxic now,1
I Love this game &lt;3,1
this game is like 10 dollars get it,1
"It's still a masterpiece today in the new generation.   Counter-Strike is easily one of the best military FPS games of all time. And when it comes with Condition Zero (also a fun game) for ten bucks, it is most certainly worth getting.  Take that COD!",1
My parents don't accept that I'm gay :(,1
"The origin of addiction... One of the most fun games I've had the pleasure of enjoying and the one who threw me to the vibrant world of FPS, my favorite genre 'til this day. Now, important information: do not be fooled by the amount of hours marked by Steam. There, when the beta versions were launched in 1999, when the game was free. Then 1.6 was launched until about 4 years ago, I had it in a different account, which I do not own anymore. Over a decade of gaming, several hours every day, which certainly have accumulated thousands of hours. By far the most played game throughout my life... You see, the first sentence that illustrates this review was not chosen at random. I had to stop playing completely, cold turkey, or I would fail high school. Just decided to buy it again and play for nostalgia sake. I'm not afraid, I'm much more self controlled now and the fact that I'm not even half as good as before, kinda takes away the compulsion to play. By far the longest relationship I have ever had and we are getting back together... this is a good day.",1
Recomand!!,1
an excellent game...but sometimes is laggy...,1
good game for play ,1
I spent 2k hours playing this game Non-Steam since I bought it on steam I don't feel like playing it. :/ 10/10,1
"Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.  The objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones:  Bomb defusal: The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. The counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage rescue: The counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP escort: One of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion. A player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although Counter-Strike: Condition Zero added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as 'freeze time') to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral 'buy zones' that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.  Standard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage, planting the bomb (Terrorist) or defusing the bomb (Counter-Terrorist).  The scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player: name, kills, deaths, and ping (in milliseconds). The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb (on bomb maps), or is the VIP (on assassination maps), although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.  Killed players become 'spectators' for the duration of the round; they cannot change their names before their next spawn, text chat cannot be sent to or received from live players, and voice chat can only be received from live players and not sent to them. Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternative media (most notably voice in the case of Internet cafes and Voice over IP programs such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo). This form of cheating is known as 'ghosting.'",1
very nice game! Grew up with this! &lt;3,1
old school,1
"Nice game, Just nice",1

"For those who, put negative reviews, well not for those but for all of them, you write negative review just because game lags, it's only your problem, much of the people has no problems with this game, this game can be ran easily on potato pc, same if you got a VAC ban that's your problem, that's your problem if you're stupid and can't play legitimately, many cheaters in your opinion?? Find another server don't sit on one server, or go to Steam-only server. People play this game only for fun, there are no ranks(not talking about server's specific ranks), that's the most important thing. Of course teamgame on this mostly dissapeared, people play only by theirselves, but that's good, you know why? You will never get nervous if your teammate fails to defuse the bomb or something like that, because you play by yourself. Talking about game modes, oh God there are so much modes, starting from Surf ending with Zombie Plague. You can play this with your friends easily, cause there are no rank restrictions. The ban system and other things like amx_ban or amx_kick are highly fixed and upgraded at maximum. You can put whatever skins you want from CS:GO and so on, and use it without any restrictions. This old - school game is being massively played for 16 years now and i think that after 10 years he's going to be played still.  Highly recommended!",1
Just amazing. Many mods. Just fun.,1
"The graphics might be bad, but who cares? People said that Wind Waker was bad only for the graphics, but once you played it, it was AWESOME. Same with this game, the graphics might be bad, but what do you expect from a game that was amde in 2000? But once you play this, it's really fun.",1

"Ok, I admit, I played this game back in my childhood on my original Xbox, and had so much fun. Not too long ago I reinstalled it for my computer, but when I did, I HATED it. I couldn't play right. People would one tap me from the side of the map, others will just be an absolute pro with the AWP making life so hard. Theres no mercy for new players, there's no official Valve servers, only the community servers which take away the classic feel. I have probably only joined 2 servers that have none of the stupid annoying Quake sounds. No 'double kill' or 'dominating' just classic CS 1.6. It was aggrovating for me, my favourite childhood game gone to waste, or so I thought. I was just bad at the game. I was scared to do anything. If I pushed in first, I thought I would get destroyed immediately. The guns felt weird and ridiculously inaccurate, the game didn't FEEL right, and anything I tried would ultimately fail. Well, until a couple of weeks ago.   I played violent. I played smart. I played gruesome and unforgiving. Getting 4 man spray downs and one-double tap headshots across the map. I was ruthless, relentless, and I enjoyed it. This game was starting to be fun for me, not as annoying, not as frustrating, only fun, as I always wanted it to be. The thing is I learned not to be scared, the same with CSGO. I played CSGO, sucked at it, played horribly until I just began to not care if I died. That was when I began to play better. CS 1.6 came, and I began to be horrifying. Enemy teams would scream at me, I would laugh and continue, their unfornate moments was fuel to my wrath, until, of course as it always happens, a pro AWPer comes towards me and 420 swagscopes me in the face. Rage quit.  11/10 would get Blazed it again.",1

"The games dead. Its basically worthless to anyone in USA unless you want to play with third worlders. Even then theres only a few servers it looks like. I would rather die than play with South Americans. Anything south of the US border is just hell ( I have never had a positive experience online with these people and if you know anything about geopolitics I need not go into that), so I advise not dealing with these peoples idiocy and just going with CSGO these days unless you want to LAN this game.  One of the greatest FPS games to ever come out and will forever remain a classic but also a game that can still compete design and gameplay wise with games released in more current times. We will never have the natural form of support from players and ESPORTS ever again. This is before ESports was just a way for devs to market and shill a game. This was from when people who liked to play a game competed and not just a bunch of rich kids trying to win monetary prizes like ESports is now (who else could play CSGO all day erry day in this economy?)  People got behind this game because they liked it, instead CSGO is all about market manipulation and human psychology manipulating with less consideration about gameplay because they want the most monetary return. If the idiots will pay hundreds for a digital knife skin then why would any company invest in gameplay that won't have direct returns like a digital nongood would have?  The video game market is full of idiots who will dump money into anything now just so they can distract themselves from the politcs, economics, and slowly declining living conditions of the western world. Bread and circus in its truest form.  CS 1.6 is from better days, more honest days. When people who wanted to make games, and people who wanted to play games were very closely related and the average IQ of someone who was online was higher than now. These days every idiot has an internet connection. That is to say, the target audience then was just better than the target audiences of todays games. This is exampled many times in economics. Mediocricity Sells.",1

You know a game is doing something right when after 15 years millions of people are still playing it. Getting old sucks though and the only things dating it are of course it's visuals and zoomed in FOV if you aren't the sort of player used to using the 4:3 aspect ratio.,1

"Seinfeld is an American sitcom that originally ran for nine seasons on NBC, from 1989 to 1998. It was created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, the latter starring as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly in an apartment building in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City (although taped entirely in Los Angeles), the show features a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, particularly best friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards). It is often described as being 'a show about nothing', as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life. ",1

Part of my childhood right there!  Playded it on a old ♥♥♥ computer for about well over 100 hours  10\10,1
I think this game is great. It is a old game so the graphics are not as good as some of the newer fps but it's a fun game. It's not a game you would play for hours day after day but it is great for playing when you get bored or to play now and then and i would recommend buying,1
Great game.,1
Best childhood game. I wish they would bring back the silly maps like Nipper made.,1
"Mannn fantastic game, hopefully the game keeps getting better and helps younger generations to enjoy the gaming scene.",1
The best game of 2000.,1
Counter strike is a game that teaches you how to use your eyes to there full potential. You must be a fast thinker and good at stratigic thought. I have NEVER enjoyed a game as much as i do with cs.,1
Most rage inducing game of all time 10/100,1
"Spent so many hours on this game during high school! Now that 'GO' is out, I'm playig Counter Strike more.",1

"Finally switching to play CSGO, loved you.",1
"Headshots, Monsterkills, Rampage! It is STILL after 10 years one of the best FPS defining games (mods :D) ever created. Due to its age is not very demanding on your PC so there is absolutely no reason for you NOT to have fun, addictive, balanced, competitive multiplayer shooter.",1

ill miss this game. it made my childhood :D,1
Pretty good.,1
what its a classic,1
"Classic. I and much of the community moved on to Source or CS:GO, but this game will always be fun. Back when this game wasn't on Steam, a couple of friends and I played this on LANs. I still revisit this game from time to time, half of it for the fun, and half of it for the nostalgia.  There is still a very active multiplayer community so you'll definitely get your money's worth. Get some mod's, make some friends, have a blast!",1
Like this :*,1
"This year , 99 is make a best Multyplayer shooter ever , realy , good job VALVE ! :D",1
Hello. I play this game for more than 14 years and still happy and would be grateful for your gift to me in the new year game Counter-Strike 1.6 thanks :),1
Pure classic - you must buy this game if you're a fan of FPS compared with TeamPlay.,1
"Although this game was made 100 years ago, it still retains its core value being a great FPS shooter that requires team work and not just 360 no scoping. This game wouldn't mean anything to a 13 year old because the graphics aren't great but to a person my age this game holds many hours in my heart. 8.5/10",1
very nice game,1
"14 years at still playing. If they drop supporting this game, I am going to lose my mind! Best server ever (64.74.97.108:27015) friendly people NO cheaters located in the US join now",1
classic.,1
"Great shooting game, of course like any game it has its flaws but this is a personal favorite of mine. Much better graphich then counter-strike 1.6. Game from 2006. but with excelent graphich. 10/10.",1
Still a great game after many years!,1
"Old classic, fantastic game :) A lot of servers with mods",1

Best classic game,1
"The only extremely good Counter-Strike game, unforunately they updated it and things got a bink wonky, but it's still more impressive than CS:GO.",1
Don't..... :P,1
Great game.,1
Best multiplayer online FPS game ever? :),1
+1,1
the bomb has been planted,1
"The game is very fun for its age and I have had a lot of fun playing this. This game means a lot to me and to some of my friends. This game was my first ever multiplayer game when I started playing it in 2007, when I didnt have steam and had to pirate it, sadly. I'm fairly sad that it is dying, but it had a good run. 10/10",1
Best Game in The world ♥♥♥♥♥essssssss!,1
"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.  I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,",1
Simply the best fps game.,1

"It's a world filled with racists, 12 year olds, drug addicts and Mexicans. They call it - CS 1.6",1
This game is so fun. I have almost 150 hours in it. 10/10,1
The real pillar of all FPS games ever to sprout out into the competitive scene. It's been around for as long as I can remember and has literally changed the eSports scene. Very balanced and runs on one of the smoothest engines every made for a first person shooter. The game is outdated now and its successor CS:GO is doing a good job at satisfying the professional scene while maintaining a very challenging and exciting gameplay,1
great game,1
;;,1
this game is AA VA SOME mast game hai,1
"I don't need to say anything about this masterpiece.   CS:GO has been out for 2 years now. As a long time CS fan (Yes the hours on STEAM are short but if they logged the data on my game disk there would be at least 3000 hours on it) Counter-Strike 1.6 just gives me a certain feeling none of the later CS games give me. Listen, if you happen to be reading this because you are thinking of buying it, get it. It will be one of the most action-packed amazing $10 you'll ever spend.",1
Nice game :),1
LIke this game !,1
I started playing this in 2002. This is completely addictive. Even at this age i like to play it when ever i have some free time.,1
.,1
"Welcome to the world’s most fun over rated pile of ♥♥♥♥.   Since I first got a PC nearly 3 years ago all I have ever heard is counter strike, counter strike, counter strike. And, after about 15 hours of play time I see why.   Right away I can see that when counter strike came out it was the magnum opus of the fps/multiplayer genre and I can respect that but that also explains the largest problem with counter strike, its nonexistent learning curve. For the first maybe 3 hours I played on a few different servers and never killed a single person. I figured I’m new to this and it seems as thoe these guys/girls have been playing much longer than I have been so I began to brush it off and then 2 hours and may servers later I had killed maybe 6 people, not much had changed. And then remembered that that’s stupid, I shouldn’t be playing against people that have 150 hours clocked while I have 5.  Another problem is the weapons  I can understand the weird names, Valve would have been a smaller company then and saved a buck by naming them weird stuff but that doesn’t mean I won’t still make fun of them. The damaged ratio is also complete ♥♥♥♥♥. The sniper rifle is a one hit kill the subs are useless and I was once hit across the map with a shot gun blast. The knife is a bit under powered but Thats better than it being a light saber. And For some reason the only guns that are ever used are the AK look alike the M16 look alike and the sniper rifle.   I should say that counter strike is not a bad a game. It's for sure a sextillion times better than any Call of Duty ever made. And I will confess that this game is more fun giving your friends ADHD kid a gram of cocaine and telling him his dad is made of candy. But it’s also as frustrating as trying to put that same kid in a car seat. ",1
"Legendary game with absoludly fantastic gameplay :) I spent about 2000h on nonsteam version of this game and then i bought it, becose i got a respect to the developers and becose i loved and i still love this game. 11/10 there wont be any same and great game as 1.6.",1

EAC is trash... CAUTION,1
"Counter Strike 1.6.... the game that set the standards of shooters and paved the way for new video games. On my old Steam Account, I racked at least 1000 hours on Counter Strike and Counter Strike Condition Zero, and all for a good reason, because it is probably one of the best team shooters in the world.  10/10",1
"Almost 7 years of playing this game and still goin' on! I hope it will not die because of global offensive. It will be a good idea to introduce steam achievements/trading cards for it, because it's a very played game",1
Love this game,1
Still good,1
"CS was the very first FPS game I was introduced to (over 10 years ago OMG), and I've been in love with it ever since.  Makes me a lil giddy sometimes, and compared to the graphics and simulation of today's shooters the quality is pretty ♥♥♥♥ (I'm prepared for some flak), but really, it's like that bottle of wine that has aged and mellowed on the beloved alcohol shelf *hic*...NOTHING can beat the classics.  A bottle of the finest Chardonnay for this veritable *hic* shooter! And another just for me.  *Collapses in drunken stupor*",1
Classick!!!,1
i love headshots,1

"Why does this game dont run normaly on my macbook 2008 Aluminium model? WTF. Frame rate is super low, i cant move the mouse, it's glitching as hell. This game should run perfeclty on my old tetris!",1
game is activated in particular region... now you are not in that region so you cant's play this game...! how to resolve this..!!,1
"Even if CS 1.6 is old, I will continue to play it until my hands won't help me anymore. Not 2015 graphics but its one of the best epic fps in the history of the gaming for both kind of players, pro's or for those who just play for fun.",1

"One of the best shooters ever made. No levels, no accessories for your guns, no 'cheat' guns... just you and your skill.  Lots of hours spent in this game and so much fun I have had with it.   8.5/10  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Uno de los mejores shooters de la historia. No hay niveles, ni accesorios, ni armas 'chetadas'... solo tú y tu habilidad.  Muchas horas jugadas en este juego y me he divertido mucho con él.  8.5/10",1

So i recommend it!!!!! to all it's not some strong game that you will be in lag or your computer is weak and you cant on this game,so this game is very small and everyone can play it!",1

so many memories.,1
This has to be one of my favorite CS games of all time :)!,1
"This game is not only the best game of the fps gender ever made but it is also the best game ever PERIOD. It is literally hundreds of games in one. You can drive cars, fly helicopters, fly planes, fly tie fighters, shoot lasers, play volleyball, play soccer, play football, play hide and go seek, ride bicycles, play dodgeball, immerse yourself in the warcraft world, be a superhero, be a surfer, be a rock climber. Oh yeah, you could also be a terrorist or counter-terrorist and plant/defuse bombs on dust 1 or dust 2. There are other maps but you don't really discover them until 10,000 hours in. But once you do it opens you up to a whole new world of wonders. This game gets a 10/10. The only games that compete are other version of counter-strike, Team Fortress Classic, and Day of Defeat. I would give it an 11/10 but there are no killstreaks.",1

The years have mold this game very nicely for the past 14 years this game has gone down as the FPS that started the series off with bang this game has everything from tatical game play to zombie infection modes. The game is made for all the FPS junkies out there its 14 yrs old but still puts smiles on all the gamers faces as they play this forever great series of games from the gaben overlord all hail the valve group for giving us this amazing game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
Cool game!,1

Buy it! Best shooter game! -For Me-..,1
The best,1
"You are 14 years old, first time trying to play something multiplayer and online. You see this game, since you have a potatoe PC you start to play this game. Runs smoothly on 53 FPS, woow sounds are great, look an AK-47 but name CV-47 you play it you shoot, you get killed asking yourself how you didn't kill him cause you shot 27 bullets on that guy and he still is alive. You play it over and over, finally getting your first kill. (cause the enemy was coruching and looking the other way and you instantly kill him running 17 bullets spent) you get high hopes, I can play this game it is so easy. You get more kills, you get greedy you rush alone you get killed when you even thought about rushing by an AWP on mid. Ages pass, poeple pass, kills get comon. You start to play better, after 2 years you learn the recoils you learn the hidding spots, you know what is the enemy's next move. You practise your awp then. You play DM and DM only with an awp, your kills are slick, and your flicks are quick and accurate. Admin invites you to his clan. FIrst time you play this game with somenone for serious. You can't do anything cause you are not used to an opposite player to play smartly and you get owned, you don't do kills and your teammates question your skill. Couple more months pass you learn your duties as a teammate. You give info you cover you open. Clan gets closed down, you find another clan you are one of the best players. You play more switch clans for better ones. You get to LANs you get scared of the all expecations and so many eyes on you. You tilt and miss your shots, months pass, you get better, you become a man of steel and high nervous, 2000 hours pass you are finally a great player. 10 000 hours pass, you win LANs you play against better players, you try a gainst payed players you are toe-to-toe with them but you loose cause your team isn't on that level and they get scared. 20 000 hours pass game is dying and so is your love for this game. But no one can pay thoose voice chats from 8 P.M till 6 A.M every weekend with your friends. So much hours in this game and you acomplished nothing. You play against your local teams you get banned cause they don't expect somene to play that good without cheats and you stop playing this cause cheaters take over, very 12 year old first downloads a cheat then this game. You get mentally tortured cause the kid is telling you how bad you are and that you suck, you cry inside. Thinking what happened to me, how come this kid plays better then me, then you figure out the cheats are great, but you still play it fairly. You cry cause no one cares for e-sports in your country and no one wants to pay you for playing games. Your parents tell you you don't have a life you loose some friends, you loose your girlfriend you stop being active in sports. YOu just play this game hoping to be recognised, but you don't so to help everyone in this world after 30 000 hours on this game, don't play it it is a sinking ship and it is pulling you down. Tears are in my eyes for all the time I was good but now you can't play a normal match since cheaters will destory you... run READER, move away, press back and never turn back on this game..",0

"Yet another great game ruined by its community. 4/5 people got this non-steam. Almost every server is not English. 3/4 servers have some mods, which make the game unplayable if you have a low lvl on some class, because how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s think theyre cool because they bought a premium class and camp in a corner.  Oh and did i mention the servers without mods have no players, or use mods without telling it.",0
"Was it good then? Probably. Is it good now? Hell no.  It might just be me, but I really don't find the appeal behind this game in 2016 - whatever year it is now. Global Offensive and Source are the series' best for me.  Don't get me wrong, I love games from this era like Quake, HL1 and I still enjoy those more than newer entries, but I just can't see why you would buy this when CS:GO is miles better for a tiny increase in price. In this case, its a matter of whether the game holds up against it newer entries or (by itself) and I just don't feel that this fulfills those properties.",0

My negative vote is for this Steam version only. CS 1.6 is a great game but for some reason valve removed bots and the main menu music in this version so I can't recommend getting this version.,0
I remember playing this game on WON. This was one of the best games on the market until GO came out. I've wasted so much time playing this game and I regret every second of it. Waste of time and it'll turn you into a homeless nerd with no friends.,0

I want to push my rig, and going back to a game from 2000, wont be doing much for me. I can understand why alot of people have trouble letting go of the past, and playing all the games they did when PC gaming started to become more relivent, but common, there are so many better looking, newer games out there that people dont give a chance. Even CSGO needs a buff,graphically and mechanically but thats just me.",0
"hello....not good, maybe anyone can help me, i cant play counter strike, every time i connect to some server, sometimes it allowed me to play but sometime not, its connectic to other servers all the time, like reconnecting....showing that loading bar...precaching items or something like that....very sad i both this game only yesterday, one more thing...tried to purchase a gift for my friend...they took my money, but didnt gave my friend a gift, nothing.....",0
you cant add the bot to your game so basicly it's kind of pointless to play the game,0
"people said it was the best cs of all time so i figured i would pick it up. when i got into my first game, i had problems looking around... this didnt stop. im stuck sometimes looking at the ground and as much as i move my mouse im still looking at the ground. sometimes im looking at a wall, and i move my mouse as much as i can. but the mouse keeps going right back to the same place on the screen. please help, i cant play until this problem is fixed.",0

"DON'T FALL FOR NOSTALGIA BIAS  Pros: -classic feel  -people still play it(barely) -no skins(almost)  Cons: -80% of the players are hackers and do not speak english(so no real teamwork) -real servers with the gamemode actually being a CS type are almost non-existant -actual enjoyability comes from whether or not you like to deal with the above  This is one of gamings most treasered games and it is sad to see it get like this. Nostalgia can only get people so far and it is a shame thaat few people explain the reality of this game in their reviews. The fun is not totally gone, although it is something you have to really try to find. The gameplay is as you would expect it (at least when you find a server that doesn't have CSGO surfers on it), nothing has changed and thats good. The problem is the community. It is hard to find a server with a team you can communicate with because of the major language barrier the game now has.  Communication is key in this game as you would expect, and it is very rare because almost everytime you get on a server it is from a central american area and the players mostly speak spanish. Making it difficult as you would expect.   The amount of hacking in this game shameful, it is more common than it is in CSGO and is a real problem that makes the experience more bad than it already has become.  The server types are just like what you would see in an old game, modded to hell with new terribly unenjoyable game modes. If you were to see you would find many gameplay modded servers that give you trash that nobody wants to see (surfing).   Take away the nostalgia bias that everyone tosses out and you will see that this game is a former shell of itself. It has all the elements of a typical old PC game that only a few people will try hard enough to enjoy. The enjoyment can still be found, but at a heavy heavy cost. RIP CS1.",0

"NONONONONONONONOONNONOONO  WTF HAPPENS? I buy the game and i just try to play it.  List of servers: '[FREE VIP]' 20/32 users in ALL servers. When i enter the message of the day never gets out when i press 'OK'. Server disconnect and automatic send me to another server. JUST FEW servers works fine, and not so much fine.  CSS Location Folder: God.. i was searching the problem about that ↑↑↑ and i just found a note block just says.. 'Have a nice huge d*ck up your as*!' and another folder with insult too.  WTF Valve? i gave the game to a friend to check if was just MY error but no. He also get the same '''error''' than me.  Maybe the first things i saw was just an error.. but founding a folder that was insulting me? I dont think so Valve, i can report this '''''error'''' but i didn't.  I buy this game just for enjoy my old times.. So i prefer download it pirate.  PS: I never touch any file or change something. Again, idk how Valve can do this and i don't think was a 'hacker'.  ",0

"Horrible, just horrible. Everyone gives this good reviews based on nostalgia. I saw all the good reviews and thought I should try it out. Upon opening the game, was a cringy menu. I fiddle with the settings, and theres no damn graphics options! I put the crosshair on small.(Definitely not small) So, I go to servers and all the servers have horrible maps. Plus, closest servers had 0 players. I click on a Dust 2 server with 10 players. When it loads up, nobody speaks ♥♥♥♥ing english. The buy menu controls were so ♥♥♥♥ed up I couldnt buy a gun. So, I stuck with the pistol. I go through the middle, and all the players look the same! You cant even tell who's who. Literally, the ♥♥♥♥ing same. So I die instantly because i couldn't even tell it was an enemy. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I finally managed to buy a gun in the ♥♥♥♥ed up menu. I find someone, spray at em', and surprisingly it was enemy. My gun starts shooting in the ♥♥♥♥ing sky, recoil over 9000, and I was burst firing! Absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Another HORRIBLE thing about this game, its graphics and audio! It just doesnt meet todays standards. I think I might have to bleach my eyes after glancing at this game. Its horrible. I only played the game for under 10 minutes and I already want to kill my self. Trust me, save your money. If you loved this game as a kid, I dont care get it. But if youre looking for a good FPS, to TODAYS standards, dont get this garbarge! Save your ten dollars and use it to get your ♥♥♥♥ sucked by the girl down the street. So, simplest way possible.  Graphics 1  Audio 1  Community 2  Experience 1  Controls 2  Gameplay 2  Overall Game 1.6 (Haha, Counterstrike 1.6)",0

First please read the review because there are a lot of fanboys who downvote all negative ones just because you want me to think perfectly of this game!  Well first of all i wanna say i dont have much to say other than this game is amazing i have played it my entire life but not the steam version a pirated version and please dont hate me for that but the most stable version of this game is pirate version wanna know the reasons why? ok fine here they are: 1.CL_flushentitypacket error which is extremely annoying given the fact that it will lagg you out and it cant be fixed because most of the servers are against the fix and usually that fix doesnt even work. While that error occurs on pirated version too it occurs really rarely while on steam version it doesnt stop the whole damn game and it is either the server that will kick you for using that fix or VAC that will kick you if you are lucky and ban you and you arent even using the third party software!!! its a console FLIPPING COMMAND!!! 2.There are a ton of servers that have a virus that will rebind all of your keys to join their server once you join the server for the first time and honestly i dont know how will this benefit either the owner of the server or you because you cant even play the server normally you will just reconnect all over again when you try to do something and in all honesty if you do such thing on your server ♥♥♥♥ you and i hope you get cancer. But you might be thinking how is this connected to not buying this game? well simple and i have 2 reasons for that. First reason is that why do you want to spend money on a game that has this type of issue and second of all the reason why this is a biggie is that in pirated version of the game you can change your binds and it will all save but unlike the steam version the 'Synchronizing feature' will save stuff but if you change the binds it will come back because people who use this exploit can work their way around it and trust me you will encounter a lot of servers like that. But trust me i dont hate this game in fact this is the game that got me into pc gaming back in 2004 but is it worth it buying a game that doesnt benefit you in any way as a legal version? of course not but its not me thinking that this game is ♥♥♥♥ in fact its evolutionary its perfect and i have spent 1000+ hours outside of steam version and i gotta say i have been getting a lot less errors and a lot less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t messages from vac for me trying to fix this error and a lot less problems than i had with the LEGAL VERSION THAT SHOULD BE MORE OF A QUALITY THAN THE ILLEGAL VERSION!. And im not promoting piracy in fact i think its lame but this is the game that should be pirated because it doesnt offer anything good in legal version in fact it downgrades a lot but when there are 50000 people that are hidden off your charts of cs 1.6 just because they wanna play normally and pirate the game there is something seriously wrong with the legal version and i really dont recommend buying this its the same as the pirated version but with more game breaking stuff! ,0

"Counter-strike, my childhood! Brings bad memories back...  One of the first Valve games, and this one is a total ♥♥♥♥. I understand why Half-life sucks so much, but how famous multiplayer trash shooter can be so badly made?! There is two teams, terrorist team and counter-terrorist team (both acts like scumbags). Your goal is to kill other team or place the bomb as terrorist. Allahu akbar! Never seen this before, bad guys can actually win. Its terrorism propaganda! Counter-strike playerbase is worst part of this, they dumb as ♥♥♥♥ and hot headed of course, alot of cheaters who cant play fair, this makes this game completely unplayable and innocent people get VAC ban (like me). Valve dont want to take responsibilty, they want to have fun with their ♥♥♥♥ing Steam money and spit on us! There is only one official game mode, kill each other and take score. Pfff, we need more!

Spent nearly 2 years on this. Don't know why,0
"One will find it is quite easy to encounter persons of highly polished skills in the original version of the Counter-Strike games. This is evidenced by thousands of hours on many of the players records; keep in mind that Steam has not been tracking game hours for a good few years after it first came out with this mod!  I highly suggest one passes by this out of date game, as classic as it may be. I compare an exaggeration of the experience for a new player to that of being anally entered, spontaneously, by barbed nethers. Overwhelming, painful, and a strong sense of defenselessness.  One would do well to instead spend their time playing the latest, 'sexiest' version, anyway. After all, the gameplay is an evolution on the one this game has to offer. I also recommend passing over the current middle-child version: Source.",0
"in 2011, I would have recomended this game, but sadly, it has degenerated beyond recognition. its sad to see such a great game fall. you need only join a server once to see that cs 1.6 is no more. get cs cz or cs source as theyre better choices these days.",0

"Counter-Strike, this one also known as Counter-Strike 1.6, is a team-based multiplayer realistical/military shooter. And a very well known one at that. It was first available as a free mod for Half-Life 1, being patched regulary up to version 1.6, until recently it got it's way onto Steam, as a serapately sold title.  So, how is the player base? Counter-strike 1.6, being popular self, has an active player base. You will see many servers, up to 32 players. At very least there are many Russian servers, as it had a cult following over there, can't really see past them. On bad side, most seems to prefer 'Terrorist plant C4' mode and then De_Dust2 is the most played map. A lot of servers run small mods, that may alter balance or other small things. And most of it, playerbase had a lot of time to play and master this game, so new players will be more frustated than having fun learning.  Counter-Strike is a very well known realistical FPS. It gained it's popularity while being free mod for popular Half-Life, because it provided something else what wasn't overused yet - realistical shootouts (using models of real weapons, you know) in team multiplayer. Unforgiving and furious. Or unbalanced and twitchy one-shot kills with headshots. Whichever one you prefer.   Counter-Strike has two types of map. First, 'de', is a mode where counter-terrorists have do defends few market spots on map from terrorist. One of the terrorists spawns with C4 in inventrory and has to bring it to one of the marked spots to plant it adn start to countdown of T's victory. Roles change as Terrorists will have now to defend this place from CTs, who's aim now are to defuse the bomb, in which case CTs will win the round, no matter how many more Ts are left. Pretty interesting mode and most played, otherwise this game would have been camping fest. And if one site is too well defended, Ts can go to another one. And then there is a second type, 'cs', in which CTs have to to rescue hostages by bringing them back to base. The problem there, is that hostage NPCs aren't perfect (though good enough) and since CTs have to rescue them all, Terrorist can camp in one of the spots around them, since CTs will have no choice but to come to win. Much less played and even if it does, it goes like your everyday Team Deathmatch, just killing all of opposite team. Much simpler anyway.  Now, the core gameplay... There are few rounds. Each round starts with each team spawning on their side of map. There is no respawning during round, once person is dead he is out, so you will have to worry much more about getting insta-killed. There are no items placed on map itself either (on correct, official maps), no kind of medikits. In spawn place, you have 15 seconds to press 'b' button (or whichever you set) to bring up 'buy menu', where you purchase weapons and equipment for the round witht he money that you earned so far. Yep, when round ends everybody gets some sum of money to spend, with winning team getting more, an ingenius design decision that helps losing team to get steamrolled even harder. What you can buy there is a pistol, primary weapon and any of the equipment. (Yep, if it doesn't smell like prototype of modern military shooters) Once past purchase screen, you are free to run and shoot. And here comes the art of recoil and aiming. For you see, one of the more important thing that is used in this game is accuaricy of your weapon. If you move it drops. if you jump, it drops. It drops while you are shooting too. Thus it becomes more importanly to get good position, making assaults more compilated, and you often have to relearn to shoot, making few clicks instead of just holding down mouse button. You will have to be often walking instead of running, to keep accuaricy while moving (it also makes you silent, so do it often), or just stand and crouch sometimes. Burst shooting is better there and for long range targets you want to be just click few times. Another important thing is that you can shoot through some walls with more powerful primary weapons. So don't be surprised for people shooting through door, walls and even just over the corner, it indeed does small damage to whoever is behind. The game also emphasises aiming because it supports headshots and they do a MASSIVE damage. And you also got three kinds of grenades. Explosive (HE), which explodes, good for throwing into chokepoints. Flashbang, which blinds whoever looked at it when it blows for few seconds, quite annoying but good for stroming into room. And Smoke Grenade, when you don't want enemies to see you coming and don't want to be under direct fire, good for open spaces with snipers (who instakill you when you peek around corner). Protip: You run slightly faster with knife out.  And well, while on theory it sounds interesting, as well as empashises teamwork. here comes the downfall of the game. The weapons, while make people with gun fetish happy, are badly balanced around each other. There are just best and bad weapons. From pistols Desert Eagle is the best, they behave as backup when you got no time to reload primary weapon. Shotguns are theorically good for close range but in this game they are useless and Assault Rifles can kill even better at close range. Sub-Machine Guns category had advantage of no accuaricy drops while moving, but are still inferior to Rifles. Rifles category has two best guns: all-range assault rifle like AK-47 and all-range sniper rifle like AWP (which doesn't even require headshot to one-hit kill), exactly what majority of people use. The only Machine Gun is 'pew pew pew can't hit'. And all-range is all-range, random is random. You may run and shoot in general direction of enemy and pull off a headshot from your AK-47 by luck. Or you may walk around corner, thinking of your next grandious tactical plan, just to get headshotted in insta-second by guy with sniper rifle from close range. It's just so full of cheap and frustating, the rage is probably the main thing that keeps players coming back for more, not honest fun, as well as luck of possibly pulling few magical headshots. Slow-down when being hit doesn't seem to be good idea either, making it harder to get away from the choke points. And random spread is not actually random, it just randomly follows one of the pre-set pattern. And yes, if you will learn them, you will be able to control your shooting better and get on top. Exactly what puts apart newbiews and elites, and exactly what elites seem to boast about when they want to say that Counter-Strike 1.6 is the best because it takes more skills and time to learn, with artifical challenges like this one that makes little sense. And well, once you spend your time to learn them, you will still find out on top that it didn't make the game any more amazing.  But you know, it's not too bad. It does teamwork well. Sometimes the game just works. When you work along the team, round the corners and storming the next room, where you follow teammates, supporting each other. Provide covering fire to the corner. When upon entering next place, each one covers his own direction, as some of the rooms just have too many places from which enemies can shoot you (smoke grenade and flashbangs help in these cases). And it's pretty damn nice at those moments, until they get ruined by something stupid, something you don't feel like could be prevented. Yea, getting shot by sniper.  And yes, this game has good enough sounds. No music, sadly. The graphics are quite HL1 high-definition era, but otherwise are fine enough. The levels are a bit of bland though.  Can't really recommend it. Because everybody who will like such games are already playing it. And player base of this game had too much time by now, that they will be just way too skilled for new players, who will just get destroyed and it will take a long time to get onto same level. It's not like there aren't enough military/realistical shooters anyway.",0
Classic game. Very innovative at its time and it's fun to play. You should get its second remake Counter-Strike: Global Offensive though which is improved in almost every aspect of the game. Only get this if you're a nostalgic freak :-),0

"Because I'm such a huge fan of CS:GO and CS:S, I decided to purchase and play the original Counter Strike. However good the game may be it's all based on petty nostalgia. If you were to compare the game to CS:S or CS:GO you would realize how inferior it really is to the two. You might say that CS:GO turned crap once Valve added cases and payed cosmetics, and in turn that makes CS 1.6 better than CS:GO. To that I say CS:GO has better graphics (no surprise) and better controls, if it's the payed skins that turn you away from the game then just don't buy skins/cases/keys. Overall I would say based on CS 1.6's time period it's a revolutionary game, however compared to modern choices the game is ♥♥♥♥.  5/10",0

"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the current iteration of Valve’s top-in-class competitive shooter, and the first to be maintained in the very modern way it has been. Learning from its experience with Team Fortress 2, Valve has a miniature economy in CS: GO that revolves entirely around gun decals. Players get a few ‘drops’ a week after matches, which can be a gun decal or a weapon crate – the latter of which cost £1.49 to unlock with a one-use key from the store. Obviously this economy is tailor-made, and so there are extraordinarily rare and mysteriously fantastic-looking gun and knife skins (with prices in the hundreds of pounds), then a large range of other skins tapering down to the common-as-muck variety that trades for pennies.  I don’t pay much attention to the CS: GO economy as a whole, though it’s interesting enough, but it’s important for a non-player to understand that a big chunk of the game’s audience takes it very seriously indeed. In the days after a new Operation launches countless forum threads are launched about the value of the new goods, whether someone should sell this new rare drop they got or hold it for a while, Twitch streams with giveaways and 50 crates being unlocked and so on. You get the picture.    I give such context on CS: GO’s economy because – even though it is a subsidiary part of the game to many including myself – it is the molten core of Operation Vanguard. CS: GO is a regularly-patched game but the major updates come in the form of Operations that introduce new maps and new skins, at the price of around £3 for an access pass – with the nice touch that maps are available to all players regardless, or made so shortly afterwards.  To give an exhaustive history of Operations would be no more useful than a general overview. If you play Counter-Strike then the chances are you play a lot of Counter-Strike. What the Operations do is freshen things up a bit – naturally they don’t disrupt the regular Dust-Mirage-Inferno cycle of competitive play, but you get some unfamiliar environments to tool about in, the chance to score some fancy new weapons, and in the context of a game you play almost daily, £3 a few times a year is chicken feed.  Operation Vanguard is different, and the changes are not for the better. The first problem I have with it is major: the way it’s sold seems to skirt the borderline of deception. To participate in Operation Breakout you bought an ‘All-Access Pass’ for £2.39. To participate in Operation Vanguard I bought an ‘Access Pass’ for £2.39. The difference is obvious side-by-side, but of course when OV popped up in Counter-Strike’s home menu I bought it more or less instantly, thinking this was the same thing.  OV’s selling point is two ‘campaigns,’ a series of missions with three branching paths. The missions are things like ‘Win 16 rounds on map X’ and ‘Kill 20 chickens in Deathmatch mode,’ and completing one bags a pre-determined award – either a weapon crate or a random weapon from a specified collection. So far, so OK. But in fact OV has two more campaigns, both of which cost £1.79 to access – which follow more or less the same pattern.    To be crystal-clear about this, the money is not the problem. I’m happy to pay for Operations, and OV’s combined total of around £6 in the context of the time I put into Counter-Strike is really not an issue. But that switch from ‘All-Access Pass’ to ‘Access Pass (with the right to buy more access)’, just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me right off.  First of all I felt conned. I bought the OV pass in the same way I’d bought all the previous Operation passes, expected it to be the same deal, and realised I’d been fooled by the removal of ‘All.’ Secondly, what the two ‘extra’ purchases offer is basically a re-skinned version of OV’s mission book. But thirdly, and this is the real killer, you’re encouraged to buy them to self-medicate the most egregious, enormous, climactically wrong and frankly offensive design decision in Vanguard.  There are multi-day cooldowns on missions. That’s right Rambo, you may have thought you were buying another set of missions and drops to liven up day-to-day business in CS: GO, but in fact Vanguard is a campaign designed to play out over a set period of time, with the only limiting factor a bald external one: cooldown timers.  Let me set the scene for you. I love Counter-Strike. I saw Vanguard was out on a Thursday, and cleared Friday night. Got in a few beers. Booted it up and bought the pass. I played the first mission, cleared it in about 15 minutes. Chose a second, the killing chickens one, and that was another 15 mins. So around half an hour into my evening of joy I was given a four-day cooldown for the next mission.    You can slice this any way you want, but it’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The sad thing is I get the thought process behind it. Consider: you’re Valve, in charge of a game where players (a) want new content but (b) put in so many hours that they’ll rush through anything almost instantly. For example, mission chains. Operation Breakout introduced missions in the form of random drops, which parcelled them out over time but had no larger arc. It was fine but the missions never felt… important. So Operation Vanguard’s missions are in structured patterns, with defined rewards, and are given the desired longevity through simple brute force of timing. You will not complete this content before we say so, because you can’t.  Oh, except that if you buy the extra mission packs, your cooldowns decrease across the board, because now you’re allowed to do more missions in a set period. That’s right. You’re basically paying to reduce cooldowns. In a Valve game.  The thing is that Operation Vanguard is only a ‘campaign’ in the same way that a pile of biscuits is ‘lunch.’ The missions are basic objectives like ‘Win 16 competitive rounds on Season’ or ‘Get 100 FAMAS kills in Deathmatch mode.’ And what do you get for completing them? Either a drop from an existing collection of guns, with a minor chance of a rare gun, or a weapon crate. The first is fair enough, but the second… I mean, at this point I already felt pretty rinsed by Operation Vanguard, and now it’s ‘rewarding’ me with crates that I need to pay more money to open.    There is a school of thought that says Valve has done this in order that a flood of new crates and mission rewards doesn’t flood the in-game economy, instead trickling them in over the coming months. To that argument the only appropriate response is – who cares? I play Counter-Strike: GO because it’s a great game, I don’t play it because of the economy, and while I accept the latter is how Valve makes money, the moment it starts intruding into the game – if indeed this explanation holds water – then the economy is not acting in the way that it should. That is, it should be improving the experience rather than throttling it.  The sad thing is that Operation Vanguard comes with my favourite selection of community maps yet, including two in Season and Back Alley that feel like potential classics. Yeah they’re all over the place in terms of favouring one side or the other, but this is par for the course with CS: GO and will be tweaked over the coming months. Every CS: GO operation freshens the game up with some new environments if nothing else, and the point of Operation Vanguard’s structure is to elongate this beyond a few days – to really showcase these excellent maps by forcing people to play on them semi-regularly for missions. It at least manages this.  I want to emphasise that I’m an enormous fan and c",0

If you enjoy stressful online multiplayer games in FPS format then you will like this game.

"I first played Counter-Strike back in 1999, when it was still just a mod. I went to it on a daily basis, for several hours, as my main source of entertainment and gathering of friends until about 2002, when other activities came along. I only went back to it now, in 2012. This unveiled the greatest disappointment and proof of destruction of a game I have ever experienced. As it is today, this is not Counter-Strike. It is a broken, unrecognizable, nearly useless form of the original game. Valve has let this game rot to death and still make an easy profit for nothing. The server browser is a joke. It is simply broken. The results it returns are completely inaccurate and all servers you will find are run by non-Steam users, with the game settings altered to who knows what, and 90% of them playing the Dust map. The other servers are running non-official maps and pointless game modes. In addition, you can not set your client to disallow the automatic download of custom server sounds or other trash that is force-fed through your connection to alter the game. Counter-Strike has been so blatantly abandoned, that it is shocking Valve still charges something for it. You will also see advertisements while you are connecting to the servers, and while you wait for the next round once you have been killed. Counter-Strike is the epitome of falling from grace and becoming an outright failure. It has become an embarrassment and a gaming tragedy.  Counter-Strike is bad.",0

While one might argue that any game is not a productive use of one's days, Counter-Strike ranks one step above almost anything out there: unless you're freakishly good or an inveterate camper, you'll spend the lion's share of your gameplay idly waiting to respawn. More, you'll inevitably (especially in 1.6) run into players so good that you'll be unsure whether they're superlative gamers or superlative cheaters.

"In its day, CS 1.6 was the shining example of a multiplayer FPS experience. It was just one of those games that, if you didn't own it, you were just statistically worse than everyone else. Oh, how the might have fallen. Nowadays, the game is plagued with a general lack of interest, as most of its fans have moved on to its vastly superior brothers, CSS and CSGO, and for good reason.  I would recommend playersonly play on servers they trust. This is because apparently one server overwrote all of my unused keys to connect to 'xdd.ms-shadow.ro:27015', which is also a server i would recommend avoiding at all costs.  This game is a relic, a fossil from an age of gaming long past.",0
the game removed on steam I would be happy if you can return it to me thanks,0
I am spin all the time when i enter on a server...please help,0
Ehhh its okay,0
"People still play this game? I was forced to buy it due to ex g/f. She was actually a professional, as in got paid, counter-strike player.",0
this game is sh*t literaly. Most of the servers are ok but when you shoot your gun you really cant tell where your bullets are landing after that. Also the registration is crap as well. Dont buy this game unless you want to get sh*tted on by a bunch of perubian butt pirates who cant afford anything or run anything else besides this terrible game.,0
Osm Loved To play :),0
Real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game nowadays. Not playable anymore. Go Source or Global Offensive.,0
to much cheaters,0
This is the best game ever I have playded. It very is nice i like lot,0
"The devs must be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, 2015 and take a look at the graphic... 2/10",0

having fps issue since 2-3 days ...before that everythng was running smooth any solutin ? tried vsyn 0 fps maxx 101 any other solution ?,0
randomly removed itself from my library,0
Not worthy 20 fps i know its made 2000 but if you want to play on good servers with good old felling play source!,0
The game is aged and very broken...,0
Too many cheaters.,0
"Great game if you like old school shooters. If you dont (like me) you shouldnt buy it and should buy the global offensive. I personaly struggled to find servers, and when I did, I saw the admins flying everyvhere",0
Still better than CS:GO,0
"Unfortunately the publisher destroyed the original game on purpose to finally be able to be successful with a sequel, the terrible CS:GO. I don't like CS:GO and now CS 1.6 on Steam is unplayable.",0
meh even though i have 1000 plus hours on csgo but not fun,0
This game runs like dog ♥♥♥♥ on my pc.  Specs: Toaster 2 toast holes dual burners crumb tray  easy lock system Heat controll for perfect toast,0
"Ehh it's not bad at all, played a 'few' hours with it, the reason why I'm not recommending this game is actually because I've been receiving or am being kicked for..  Reason: Fake Client. etc blah blah blah  Don't have any ways to resolve this issue, and I might make a 'YES' recommendation once I get it fixed.   One more thing, when I mean I DON'T RECOMMEND this, I mean, you can buy this game and it's up to you, cuz I probs played this game since aged 7 or sumthin, But play it on yer own risk.",0
this game need ♥♥♥♥in fix !!!! every time i click on a key it sends me to other server or reopen the server,0
Stopped working and cannot find help,0
There is a bug in the game. 8/10 times config file gets reset and I have to change all the settings and console commands back to my comfort again.Very disappointing :(,0
Only played by s p i c s,0
"This game lies in ruins...  I remember when in the past I used to play this game it used to be a lot more fun. But now, on each and every server you will find atleast 2 cheater using aimbot and wallhack. Also on every server there are always people who are using the non-steam i.e. pirated version of this game. If that's not enough steam is VAC banning the innocents like me. I was playing this game on a deathrun server , barely 7 days from the day I had brought this game. My router went off for a second and when it was back on I saw that I had been VAC banned. Reason : Cheating inflaction. How the hell do you use cheat on a deathrun server ?! And one more thing : The steam guys say that VAC BAN is delayed and takes time , then how the hell did it BAN me in just 31 hours of gameplay ?  Hope this review has helped you in getting a better view of the game.  I have got many games for free from this group :  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Accidently  . It's an awesome group and I would recommend you to join it if you like to get games for free.",0
wow me vac banned not problems.. Buying play today.. Vacban too.. OMG,0
  ♥♥♥♥ cheaters -_-,0
ban vac security for use auto bunny in a jailbreak ._. ,0

"this is my childhood game, but seeing it this way hurts me, most of the keys i am using during playing the game as everyone does, leads me to some servers and stuff, wtf is this? i can't spray, i cant chrouch and ♥♥♥♥. if anyone knows how to fix this pls tell me how",0

"Anyone considering getting this game at this point, because the price has come down to 10 bucks... don't. On a functional level, it's not playable. The control scheme is not for most people, and you will cause yourself carpal tunnel syndrome from spinning the mouse in rapid circles while holding a button to charge up. That's if it starts up. And considering it's been abandoned by the creators, there's no bug support if it won't. Beyond the technical issues, the plot and styling of this game is in some of the most poor taste I've ever seen, from fake Chinese speach clearly thought up by white people to blatant homophobia I get the uncomfortable feeling isn't actually joking, it really has all the most reprehensible behavior you'd expect from fratboys. If this crap was done in the guise of joking, it'd be comparable to if a standup comedian delivered a KKK-grade black joke and then spent five minutes yelling 'ISN'T THAT FUNNY!?' at an audience that clearly doesn't agree. If you want a game that's playable or has a well-designed, non-offensive story, this one probably isn't for you. If you have no taste, waste ten bucks and see if it even runs for you. For my money, I'd be better off burning 10 bucks for warmth or literally eating it. It was on sale for $2.50 (I believe 90% off at the time) when I got it and I still want my money back.",0
"Install it, Tries to play, The game crashes, uninstall, reinstall, still doesn't work Money Wasting Simulator 11/10",0
I don't really like this at all actually. Controls feel awful.,0
"Avoid it, I tried it and wanted to get used to the wierd play mechanics, but it was not natural or easy, So many other better games... why bother?",0
"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! Controls are terrible and campaign is impossible to complete because of this but you have to play it to unlock anything. I only put this under recommend because, for some dumb reason, there is no other way to review it on here. I also butchered it on metacritic, GOTCHO ♥♥♥ RDKF!",0
"It doesn't play all that well to be honest. The graphics look okay, but the gameplay itself is too, well I wouldn't want to say hard, but you have to keep a lot of things in mind and be on your toes if you want to succesfully beat someone, or just the objectives. It minimizes the fun factor. I honestly think they could've built a better game around this ragdoll mechanic. Would I want to see a new or other game with this kind of ragdoll fighting ? No. It's 'fun' for just a few minutes at best. Keep away.  [Rating: 62/100]",0
"Have you always liked fighting games, but just wish that once in awhile they could stop trying to do all that 'fun to play' and 'challengingly deep' and aesthetically appealing' stuff and replaced it all with HORRIBLE RACISM?  GUESS WHAT  YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TALK TO SOMEONE",0
The most shameful embarrasingly bad game I have ever had the displeasure of playing. I profoundly hope the creator has given up his misguided ambition of ever making another game. If there is indeed a reciprocating vengeful force such as karma than the developer of Rag Doll Kung Fu has cursed his family bloodline for generations. I would not catergorize Rag Doll Kung Fu as a game but more appropriatly a war crime.,0
1st 3rd party game released on steam 1st regrettable purchase made on steam,0
"Whoa. I know Kung-Fu.  No, Keanu, you don't.  And neither does anyone in this game.",0
You buy it because you're curious...  You uninstall it because its gameplay is really annoying and the novelty dried out... fast...,0
"To all People Who Want To Buy This:RETURN.NOW. DONT WASTE 10 EURO ON THIS GAME... The Game's Fully Abandoned,It Was In Work For A Few Years,And There's No Multiplayer. The Story's Meh,Combat System Feels Weird,No Advice,And And And... I acutally paid for this...Im Not Happy,But it's Ooookkaaay. If you want to use this as an Review in the Internet,Try it. Yet there are no real features...there are many missing ones,And Such...If you want to support someone who gave up on this game,buy it.If Not,Then Waste Your Money On Hats In TF2 Or Something Like That.",0
"The game is actually good, just not for the price.  I picked this up for three dollars, it came with another game and it was at Dollarama in a physical case. I figured multiplayer on Steam was a thing, since I originally bought a copy for my friend from the same Dollarama and noticed it had steam.  I'm a bit disappointed that it still doesn't exist, same with a lot of features that you'd expect. However, it seems to be ready for multiplayer to be added, as well as the ability to support never-incoming workshop content, since the mods are all really simple reskins.  The game is very simple and fun, and the story is mature, B-movie level garbage, as if Kung Pow: Enter the Fist was directed by Cheech and Chong.   If anyone can find Mr. Healey and get him to mend in workshop and multiplayer or pass the license off to someone willing and capable, it might do a whole hell of a lot better, rather than abandoning it for the PSN version, or even the iTunes comedy doodle version.  Worth 3 bucks, not 10.",0
"If it were free, I would recommend it, but it is not. I bought it for 30 while it was on sale, so I found that to be money well spent. However, when the price is 80 US dollars, making it only 10 dollars away from something as powerful as 3D Coat, which does modeling like magic and mixes in sculpting and among other things. It is very very hard to recommend this relic to anyone when for 10, 20 or 30 dollars more you get much much more useful software like Modo Indie or Substance Painter. This was an astounding and flexible piece of software 5 years ago, that’s for sure. Now? It's old, it's buggy and overpriced.",0
"I bought Silo back when it was only $80 and during a 40% off sale so I didn't spend much. But now the full price is $119.99 without any real updates - WTF?!? For the price and considering Silo is abandonware I simply cannot recommend Silo. Instead I'd recommend Blender (free) or Modo Indie (cheap).  I originally purchased Silo for at home modeling. Although experienced and trained in 3ds Max and Maya those are just too expensive. I had also first tried Blender but was so put off by the user interface that I ended up buying Silo. This turned out to be a mistake because I ended up revisiting Blender went thru some free tutorials on cgcookie website and Blender became easier to use. Blender might take longer to learn but the reward is that it is more powerful and faster to work with once you learn it.  Right now I have over 50 hours in Modo Indie. Modo is the best modeling software I have ever used. Ever. Better than 3ds Max and that is saying a lot because I love 3ds Max. Modo Indie's Meshfusion and Procedural Modeling is simply amazing - look on youtube for demonstrations. Modeling in Modo is 20 times better and 5 to 10 times faster than working in Silo. Modo Indie is available at low monthly subscription cost or full license. The full price of Modo indie is $299 and if you compare price and features to Silo it's a no brainer. With Modo you are getting not only better modeling and uv tools - you can also texture, sculpt, animate and render with a high quality ray traced renderer. And to top it off Modo has an awesome user interface. (If you want to purchase a full license for Modo wait for a sale.)  I'd only recommend Silo if it were free especially since the developer is putting zero time into it. Both Blender and Modo are actively being developed.",0
"Silo 2 is a fairly decent program warned the lines of beginners than anything, however they may find a number of things to hold the lack of tutorials and support, overall it is a decent model program for its price.",0
even on 84% off its still questionable software at best :/ if you want a great modelling tool I'd have to recommened 3DS Max or Maya. this comes nowhere near close to being worth 100 pounds!0,0
"I bought it when it was on sale some time ago. Sadly the product isn't supported anymore by the developers. I ran into a ton of bugs and it was difficult to find help to get around issues. Many of the help/tutorial links were broken as well.  When it was working, I though it was a good tool. However because it is no longer supported by the publisher/developer it's really hard to reccomend.",0
"DO NOT BUY THIS! If you test the trial version and most things work DON'T GET FOOLED! As soon as things become more complex than a CUBE the software will crash on cutting polygons, boolean operations, YOU NAME IT! And the worst part is that you can NOT fix your mesh, because it's the software that completely destroys it! It's next to impossible to track down what action destroys your mesh in order to avoid using it since it's freaking random! Save your money and your time!",0
Crashes every few minutes. Not capable of modelling anything. Not of merchantable quality.,0
it sucks      /; /; /; /; ,0
"This game was the best one out there, but not anymore. (Because of the players online)  If you want to play Free For All or something like that, tough ♥♥♥♥ nobody plays that anymore.  If you want to play Zombies, you won't get very far at all, people play it, but all of them are stubborn, picky, pieces of ♥♥♥♥, if you do not meet their expectations you will be instantly kicked, or the host will end the session. Same goes with if you host a lobby, the same stubborn picky pieces of ♥♥♥♥♥ will leave immediately.  A thing I noticed is that if no one hacks in the lobby, the lobby will end because the hosts just want hacks, little 10 year olds only play the game to 'hack'  So basically the game is so dead to the point where people no longer want to play the game how it is, they want to play a modded version of it, and that if you don't hack, you're too low and you'll be kicked.  So only buy this game if you plan to play solo or with your friends, because everybody else online is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  If you already bought this game, instantly go request a refund like me.",0
"I just played a few rounds of Team Deathmatch on multiplayer, and good god was I disappointed. I played the Xbox 360 version back in 2012 and either the game has aged worse than I thought possible, or the PC version's multiplayer has been stripped down to the bare minimum, especially when compared to the console version There's little-to-no HUD, the map keeps disappearing and reappearing, the controls are wonky and simplistic, and really, it felt like I was playing an online FPS from 2002 as opposed to 2008. I for one, am NOT a happy camper for sinking half of a steam card into this....",0
wont even open for me fix this bug or i want my money back!,0
"Once a great game, now just appauling. 100% due to it's age and lack of a community, Hardly even worth a review as I'll be refunding it.  So instead I'll share my thoughts of the console version which I played for years upon release.  Great visuals and an awesome story (in terms of Call of Duty stories that is) Multiplayer is a huge success and brings hours and hours of enjoyment with the usual prestige system they've got going.  Overall this was one of my more favoured COD experienced.  I'd give this game a 8/10 I'll just urge you all not to bother buying it anymore as the playerbase is basically nothing.",0

Very upset with this game. It doesn't let me host private servers with my friends and it doesnt let me play nazi zombies with my friends. I expected more from it but i was let down smh....,0
im not sure if its the game or steam itself but when ever i try to launch the game is fails to open.i have spent money on a game that does not work please either help me or give me a refund.  ,0

"Unable to create multiplayer account, if activision really cared about fixing this back in 2013 this wouldnt be an issue.  Yes, ive tried every fix without any luck.",0
I would reccomend this game if it were possible to play multiplayer. But its not sadly.,0
"Cant even create an online profile, you rock activishit.",0
"Not for me. I liked some of the CoD games, especially for their mixture of some story and action, but this game has too much repetitive action, and the AI is just bad. Enemies screaming 'Banzai' and then charging at you from the other side of the map. wtf?   Not to mention the somewhat weird, almost elusive story. It's just random short episodes of random soldiers throughout the war. I fail to see the golden threat. And the heavy Allies bias is somewhat annoying. We get it, they 'won' the war. The game just seems to try to shove it into my face anytime it can (obviously, it's about WW2).  I guess I'll stick to the fictional shooters from now on :D",0
"bad.  story mode is meh, and the game game will not read the mod folders that have been inserted into the game's files.",0
"Ok this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, so I installed the game and went in hoping to have some fun with some randoms, it then tells me to create an online profile, so I typed in the name and it went into an infinite loop, so I can't go online and actually play the game for what it is worth, until I get a fix, this is a bad game. Do not buy this game, you might as well pirate it.",0
I would recommend this game to anyone ... but ONLY if you can get the uncut version i bought it for the zombies but cant play Z-survival  definetly going to refund it ... damn german law system :/,0

"As we all know the real reason the Allies won the Pacific Campaign was due to Japanese soldiers inexplicably getting stuck on terrain. This was in despite of their magical powers to walk through mid air, and the fact that occasionally their soldiers simply wouldn't show up, forcing the Allies to load a previous save and try again hoping that the rest of the mission would trigger correctly.

soo its 1000 ppl playing and i cant find a zombie match like what??? gotta question tho is there refunds????,0

Worst game I've ever played. ♥♥♥♥ off Activision,0
"The multiplayer is about dead to be honest. There are several servers that show almost full but they are all down for 'Maintenance' so it redirects you to a server that has like 6 people in it.

It's an alright game to play with friends but if none of your friends have the game and you try to go on a multiplayer match you'll find that almost every servers is an xp server which really takes the fun out of the game zombies almost makes up for this because it too is enjoyable if you have 2-4 friends willing to play if you don't good luck finding a zombies server to join.,0
"The game is nice and fun, but there is one problem I keep having. I can't create an online profile.

"I would recomend this game years ago. Now the servers suck, you wont find a server without 3 or 5 hackers. Don't buy it. Spend your money in somethig that worth it.",0
Every time I go into multiplayer it deletes my progress and i get demoted all the way back to private,0
"Thanks for giving me the censored version Steam! Paid 10 euros for basically nothing, since the single player campaign sucks 4ss. Bought the game for zombies, but got no zombies... Apparently the EU version doesn't have those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nazi zombies. Cheers!",0
"Played a couple of games and after attempting to open to play again, it would not launch. Self-help recommendations are useless. Just list about 40 programs that could interfere but no explanation as to which one or how to fix. To contact support you need a separate account. Absoulutely useless!",0

"An older shooter that still has a cult following. It seems like everyone has their favorite COD game. This just isn't mine.  Theres issues getting this working on some pcs, everyone is high level at this point, thus you're almost required to use a leveling map before playing for real with most the better weapons unlocked at the very high teirs.   I personally would only buy this game if you have freinds that play it. and if you do have freinds to paly with it is a pretty good game, its just old.",0

I bought this game expecting to be able to play custom zombies with friends but when I go into the mods to play one its completely empty. I bought this game to play custom zombies only and thats the ONLY thing I cant do. I dont know if its something with my pc or the game.,0

I love this game and have played it before on console but i want it for Steam but it won't work on my pc . So if your going to buy this game make sure you read all the fixes incase this happens to you",0
Do not buy it! for me it is on German and i can not change it. I am from and live in Sweden so i have no idé what to do.,0
This Game wont work,0
Have fun trying to connect to their 'online services'. I've been getting stonewalled by Activision support for over a month now.,0
"DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT MULTIPLAYER:  I bought this for multiplayer zombies. To unlock Zombies, I had to recomplete the campaign, which although is fun I have done a thousand times on my XBOX. The multiplayer did not work for me or my friends and I couldn't refund it because of the playtime I had accumilated unlocking the content that did not work. Waste of time, shame on Steam for not making this clear before purchase.  If you want a good shoot'em up campaign through the European and Pacific theatre's of WW2 and vanilla COD 5 zombies solo however, here's the game.",0
"Nope, hmmmm wait ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... NOPE  Zombies? Wait ... ... ... ... ... ... ... in world full of zombies ... ... ... nope ... this is MAYBE last thing what save this game.

this shouldn't be $20. maybe $10.,0
  this is gamei s super bugey..  campaign too hard.,0
"If you are like me, Nostalgic towards then you like me will probably dislike this game.  Recently I bought COD WAW to revisit my memorise.  But the game is just not fun and its linear,  This bought me loads of joy when I first played but doesn't hold up well today,  However on the plus side the multiplayer still works and is poplular and the community is great.  If you have friends buy it....if not go die alone like me",0
"my friend does not want to get this game, but this game is good",0
"I played the game once and got off. It then got stuckand always said i was playing, even if i wasnt online. It still wont let me on, and it wont even let me uninstal it. After a while, its gotten better, and allowed me to play it. It still made my computer slow for some weeks, and now tells me i have played 200 hours, even though i have not.",0
i love this game but the only thing that i wanted was to play with my friend to kill zombies and complete campain but everytime i try to invite him in the game it doesn't allow him and for this i don't recommend it ;C,0
why cant i play zombies???,0
this game is ♥♥♥,0
"The game does not support Donald J. Trump. It is the worst game of all time. Awful. Run by stupid, stupid people. We need to fix it. The game. It will be tremendous once I'm done with it. It will be a beautiful beautiful thing. Make world at war great again.",0

I live in Germany and I only wanted this game for the zombie mode... because I live in Germany I have no zombie mode but still have to pay the full price thats just unfair,0

"bought the game because of zombies . Can't download any zombie maps gg , and can't refund , fml.",0
"I'm reviewing solely the campaign portion of World at War, since that's what I got the game for and all that I've played.  Years after enjoying World War II shooters like Medal of Honor: Frontline and Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, I wanted something of the same mold. After asking people and reading reviews, I believed that World at War would have the best campaign yet.  I would be disappointed.   From beginning to end, World at War lacks intensity, persuasiveness, and engagement. The game places you onto tracks upon which you complete missions by going through a series of checkpoints. The campaign rushes through the war to put most of its focus on the last months before the Third Reich surrendered, so the momentum’s on your side from the start and nothing you and your squad do actually matters. You play a Russian and American soldier alternatively, who both get undue amounts of recognition by their squad leaders while remaining privates throughout their careers. Insufficient effort is made to make either character feel like your own; instead, you’re seeing their experiences in first person. Treyarch apparently intended to portray common soldiers as unrecognized heroes, and the game developer did an admirable job at that. But besides engendering respect, nearly every other aspect of the game falls short of what even predecessors had.  Whereas in Frontline, many of your missions were done alone and getting to work with teammates was a treat, here, you are always fighting with comrades. There is no infiltrating a village or mansion alone, or completing a mission by modulating your pace and playing style. Instead, you go down hallways and courtyards with your squad, occasionally getting to choose whether to take the right, left, or center path to kill the enemies your allies may take out anyway if you let them. Unlike Big Red One, formerly intimidating trenches are just places to rush in and out as you proceed to your next objective, which will be no more interesting to complete than the last one.  During each mission, I hoped that the game would finally become fun, but by the time around ten hours had elapsed, the campaign was complete with few instances worth remembering, and those few were times when I’d all but ignored my squad to assault the enemies alone for brief action-packed moments before getting killed.  One the whole, the World at War formula’s something like this: Wait to get ambushed. Pick up that weapon. Kill those guys (if you can, before your too-ballsy-to-live squadmates rush out and get themselves killed, not that it matters). Move to the next point. Rinse and repeat. If World at War’s placed in a nutshell, it won’t want for room.",0
wow wont launch for me ,0
i cant play it bcuz when u hit multplayer after slecting a account if puts you to the home screen,0

"As has always been the case with CoD, its multiplayer side is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and rife with cheating, screaming kids and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on the mic. So for the sake of this review I will focus entirely on the singleplayer aspect of the game. Keep in mind I am writing this from the perspective as someone who enjoys learning about history, and is a big fan of the previous two WW2 CoD games for PC (Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2).  Let's list the pros first.   Much better graphics and more detailed environments than CoD1 and CoD2.    In this one you finally get to fight in the Pacific as the US against the Japanese Empire, which is a new and fresh change from the previous two CoDs which focused entirely on the Allies VS the Nazis.    You are finally able to throw back live grenades to save yourself from death, but this really should've been a default feature of CoD2 anyway. At least they got it right this time.    A decent variety of different mission types and environments. It has much more to offer in terms of gameplay variety than CoD2 did, but still less variety than CoD1 offered.    New types of explosives and special grenades that can be used. Molotovs. Satchel Charges, and throwable Mortar bombs, for example.    Flamethrower weapons that actually burn the environment around you, and can destroy foliage and burn corpses.    Slightly more interactive environments than the previous CoD games.  Sadly those are the only positive things I can say about this game. There are unfortunately a lot more negatives.    Campaign is only 15 or so missions in length, and each mission is also very short in length, taking only 10 minutes or so to complete. On the previous two WW2 CoDs for PC, they both had AT LEAST 23 missions, each of which was decently long and had more historical atmosphere.    Fences, EVERYWHERE. Where the heck are all these warring people getting all these barb-wire and pikestick fences from, how do they have the time to place them all, and why are these fences specifically confining people into very well-defined and convenient areas for the player? CoD2 fixed this problem a lot on the majority of their maps by using minefields instead to kill the player if they tried to leave the map, but unfortunately this game has practically NO use of that mechanic and instead just has tons of fences spammed everywhere.    Game-breaking bugs that make some missions impossible to complete without totally restarting. For example, on the Eviction level, there's a 50% chance that your team leader (the old russian guy, I don't remember what his name was) will get stuck in the motioning-in animation by the grate-door opening to the subway, and you need him with you to complete the mission. All you can do to fix this is to restart the mission and HOPE he doesn't do it again.    Much of the game's atmosphere is just zombie-apocalyptic with death metal music for ambience, probably done by the developers to appeal to your average run-of-the-mill FPS ♥♥♥♥♥♥s who don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about history and just want to shoot stuff.    The mounting feature for deployable weapons (such as the MG42) is practically useless because there are almost no points on any of the maps where you can actually mount it at. You should be able to mount it anywhere you are at, there's no reason not to be able to.    The Russians are depicted as murderous, merciless, brutal monsters, who kill everything in sight, terrorize and torture innocent people, and take no prisoners. In some ways with Communist USSR, this is accurate, but the developers pushed this attitude onto the Russian characters in the game to the point where it's arguably anti-russian propaganda.    Many of the Pacific Campaign maps are poorly designed, with it being impossible to see where you are going without literally walking alongside the map's [s]fluid and convenient fences[/s] walls just to find the path.    The GUI is cartoonish and poorly designed. Instead of a large number counter to show the bullets in your clip, you have a tiny little indicator in the bottom righthand corner of your screen, with the bullets in your clip shown by actual individual icons of bullets, which are so small you can barely even see them. This is something that the previous two WW2 CoDs were much better at in regard.    The main characters in the game are completely flat, boring and static; they have very little about them that's interesting and are just your average generic soldiers with guns. Even in the previous CoDs they managed to make their characters interesting and much more engaging.    Unlike the previous WW2 CoDs which each had about 2 tank levels, this one only has one tank battle level, and it sucks. The tank movement mechanics are unresponsive and poorly designed, and it's extremely easy to get your tank stuck, to where you have no choice but to restart the level. CoD1 did a great job of providing stable tank movement, with the ability to just hold the spacebar to have your tank orientate with the turret. Oh yeah, that reminds me: You can't drive independently with free turret movement. The tank only drives in the direction your turret faces.    The beautiful sound effects for guns that were in CoD2 have all been thrown out in favor of generic, much-quieter bullet sounds. Very disappointing from an aesthetic standpoint.    The melee knifing mechanic is extremely overpowered and oftentimes I have just resorted to flanking my enemies and knifing them all. It's incredibly unrealistic and historically inaccurate, and is one of the most unbalanced and tasteless video game mechanics ever invented.    The sprinting mechanic is likewise overpowered and lets you run super-fast for long distances, with a very short and very invisible recharge time.   All in all this game was clearly just made to appeal to mindless 'MLG 360 Noscope' FPS gamers, with little regard for appropriate treatment of historical atmosphere or character development. I must say I am considerably disappointed in this game, and I can't really recommend it to anyone with an IQ above 90.",0
costs more than battlefield 4,0
"I got this game for the co-op. I don't really care for the story, but this is why I am very displeased with this waste of ca$21.99. The nazi zombie coop is completely terrible for joining your friends, it simply does not work without a 3rd party program helping this game.",0
"This game sucks for reason that you cannot run at all i got Banned from all of the servers for running to cover WWII Had running , thowing grenades while moving and aiming down the sites All of these things will get you banned from servers",0

"If you are considering downloading this game for the sole purpose of playing Nazi Zombies online, do not get this game.

welcome to cod a game populated by lonely 40 year old men hoping to fufill their dreams of joining an army (you could join a militia at the age of 5 in my home land) the lonely 40 year olds playing this game can be very volatile because one time I was doing a joint co-op mission with these gay lords and suddenly they started screaming at me '2 IS DOWN' I was very confused because I have absolutely no clue who 2 is and why he is down so I decided that was enough and so I started screaming at them 'IS THERE A XBOX VERSION OF THIS?' whilst typing that I was guzzling a 4l bottle of mtn dew and also crunching on a 50kg bag of chilli heatwave doritos and came to the swift conclusion i'm not better than the people i'm offending.  So I decided to join the local army only to have my leg blown off by an IED and then die.  5/10 - halo is way better with grafixs and simulotion also THERE IS TOO MANY VEHICLES IN THIS GAME!!!!!!!!,0

Seriously google 'why can't i connect to games on world at war for steam' and a load of people have this problem. Worst of all some of these are 2 years old, meaning those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bags of ♥♥♥ havent done jack ♥♥♥♥ with it. Its truly a gamble with this game. Either you have it working or no.

I just wanted to play with my cousins and friends but i cant.   I just wasted 20 dollars that a game i cant have fun with,0
First of all im in germany and why can't i play zombies? please help,0
"After playing 12 hours (and even days of playing on console and other accounts) of Call of Duty V: World at War, I can say this game is dead. Well the multiplayer version is due to the lack of good quality servers; most of the servers now are level boosting, bazooka and rifle grenade chaos. Despite the care for hackers, they have ruined it for the consoles but on here its somewhat tolerated. The only thing now is the zombies; the mini game that brought Treyarch its name today. This game mod origanally has 4 WaW maps and now has a plethora of Custom Zombies maps. The only real purpose of this game now the zombies. Unfortunatly, I do not recommend this game now. Rating: 6/10 okay.",0

"Single player wise, I thought COD 4 (Modern Warfare) was good and refreshing. But this... this is back to enemies (and comrades) showing up in endless streams and it's badly masked. There are attempts to tell some kind of story and make the player bond to characters, but they fail. Might be related to the situation always being 'OMG WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD AND KILL THE BAD GUYS'. While action is nice, a change in pace could have helped the 'story'.  The entire thing feels soulless and predictable from start to end. This has been done before.  Can't speak for multiplayer.",0

Get Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army 2 (this is actually a lot more fun than I thought it would be). Like the singleplayer? Get Wolfenstein 3D, they have about the same depth, or Metro if you're looking for a game with good combat and great singleplayer, or Red Orchestra 2 if you're looking for a WW2 style single player (but it's really not that good). Like the multiplayer? Get Verdun, Red Orchestra, or Rising Storm. They all do it better, and even if they are a little different, trust me, you'll have more fun with them.",0

I thought there would be zombies solo but you can not do that unlike xbox 360 i bought this game for solo zombies and its not on here only 2 or more players.,0
hated this game DO NOT GET IT already waiting for my refund!,0
Does not let me play coop with friends,0
Didnt Really like it to be honest i acctuly thought i would enjoy it but i really didnt for starters its glitchy and The Multiplayer setup is horrible i only really bought it to play Zombies cause i remember playing zombies with my cousin on console but i was really disapointed by evrey thing,0

Controller support is lousy, surprising for a console port. If it had straight up no-hassle 360 controller support I would'nt be complaining, and I'd still have this installed. You can force it to read your input via a console command but there's no vibration, rendering it pointless, if you ask me.  The russian campaign and zombie mode are the best this thing has to offer.  For everything else? You need a high tolerance for bull ♥♥♥♥ and your own time going in a hole.  The multiplayer CAN be fun. wasn't for me. you might even enjoy the pacific theatre levels of the campaign.  If you like call of duty, and you liked finest hour and all the other old ones, you'd love this. Treyarch is still better than infinity ward.  OH. no achievements. This doesn't matter in the big scheme of things but this is a console port. Ya think they'd have put the effort of patching some cheevsters in here for the steam version.",0
Sound quality is very low and the game is very buggy. Only a few minutes in and I saw a bunch of T-poses along with a nice crash.,0
did not work playing with friends ,0
Good game when playing alone. but the real frustration is trying to play co-op. IT DOES NOT WORK!!! GET ON THIS GUYS COME ON!!!!!,0
why cant u just play zombies,0
"- Horrible console FOV that feels terrible playing on a monitor three feet away rather than a big TV ten feet away. For the peanut gallery: FOV has nothing to do with the quality of your screen, it's about how much you can see, and has a big effect on whether you get motion sickness playing a game. Most modern 1st person games have adjustable FOV sliders in the options. This doesn't, and the FOV is way too narrow.  - Stupid 'portraits' of a developer in Nazi uniiform hanging up in buildings. This isn't an Easter Egg. It might be if there was *one* in a difficult-to-find room: these are all over bombed-out Berlin, where in the Third Reich pretty much every building would have had a picture of Adolf Hitler. It doesn't feel like a cheeky hidden secret, it feels like smirking, masturbatory game developer BS. It also doesn't help that the person in question is a pudgy neckbeard who doesn't in the slightest resemble the average Nazi officer ubermensch type. Maybe Reinhard Heydrich had a shelf full of panty-flashing anime statuettes above his desk, but he sure didn't look that way: this guy does, and it's a huge immersion breaker.  - Keeps calling Soviets 'Russians'. No, this isn't 'racism', it's historical inaccuracy. The Red Army was composed of troops from all over the USSR, not just Russia. It's like calling anyone from the USA a Texan.  Feels like it was developed by people who've seen lots of movies and never read a book (I guess that's the target audience too - a death spiral of ignorance). I'd like to say 'but hey, it's Call of Duty, whaddya expect', but I can't, because the first CoD game was superb. However, this one comes from the same clowns who gave us the Black Ops series, so it's a lot of Michael Bay-style orange fireball theatre, cliches and general d1ck-wagging.  The briefings are nicely done, though.",0
i cant play zombies with my friends,0
"Steam, Fix your game It always says it running when i Close the game and then im unable to invite people to my games. FIX YOUR GAME",0
Fun to play but crashes to much to be enjoyable.,0
"Buggy and frankly the missions suck. Stupid AI is constantly putting friendly npcs in front of you for you to shoot.  At one point I lost my weapon due to an attack from a dog. The notice that the dog attack remained on the screen and I could no longer pick up any weapon. Aborting the mission meant going back to the very beginning instead of that particular phase.  I recall playing COD (the very first one) a long long time ago and it was with a fond remembrance that I bought this game. Unfortunately the player in solo mode is too tied to his AI squad mates who are stupider than dirt. The graphics might be better than the very first COD, but not by much.   I'm sure that this is great in coop or multiplayer, but I don't play those modes and they have no appeal for me. If I want to play with someone I'll do it face to face thanks muchly.   This was just not a good purchase as far as I'm concerned. I can't recommend it.",0
Piece of ♥♥♥♥... totally worst COD of all time.. not sure if worst game of all the time.. totall waste of time.. dont buy.. dont play,0
"This game is the epitome of bad ports. Non stop problems, just wanted to play some zombies with my friends but there's nothing but connectivity issues and crashes. It's sad that activision still keeps this game priced at $20 and never below $10 on sale. This game should be selling for $3 and no more because it's pathetic to sell a game this unstable for $20",0

"This is one of the only Call of Duty's I would ever say go out and buy... Until Punkbuster dropped support for all the old Call of Duty's if it wasn't for the horrible Punkbuster anti-cheat I would recommend it. If you want to play it for the custom zombies with friends, yes go out and buy this game. But for Multiplayer you're better off picking up the newest one thats out because any server that has Punkbuster enabled all it's going to do is cause you a headache from frustration.",0
one of the worst games i have ever played ( just kidding ),0
it keeps on freezing on me and it lags too much and its not worth getting it,0
"Pretty much what you might expect from a Call of Duty game, for better or worse. The graphics are pretty good, and there are some admittedly great set piece moments, but like every CoD game after the original game and its expansion, the majority of the campaign is pretty tedious and far too predicatable, and the story is really lazy and dumb, despite decent attempts to break the mold by good voice over by Gary Oldman and Kiefer Sutherland, and having the game take place in the Pacific and Eastern Europe, rather than Normandy and the Ardennes as is the case with most WWII shooters.  The multiplayer is definitely entertaining for a while, and I appreciate the campaign co-op option, but honestly the only reason I come back to this game at all is the mindless, yet hilariously fun Nazi Zombie mode; this alone was almost worth the price I paid, and would be the only reason I would consider picking up another CoD game in the future.",0
"This game is bad, Zain made me buy it and I've fed up of Zomboids. God damn enslaving raptors make me feel like dragging my eyes through a meat grinder.",0
the game didnt let me open it,0
it won't let me play the game..!! ,0
ok its a good game for its campaine but it needs a workshop there is not that much content,0
bugs bugs and more bugs  error 51 first now crashes when i'm trying to change gparhics settings  tired of bugs in games,0
"The Call of Duty franchise was great until this game came out, where do i begin...  Pros:  Historical accuracy and information is much more than the previous games.  You get to play as an American captive in the Pacific Theatre, which was never done in the previous two games  You can throw a activated grenade back at the enemy if you are quick enough.  On that note, you get far less ammo than the previous two games, making the game more realistic  You can reload the M1 Grand without having to deplete the entire clip.  Cons:  The voice acting is disgusting. It sounds like it was tacked on as an afterthought rather than integrated into the actual game. It sounds like Treyarch hired the actors from b-reel movies.  The cinematics don't show a lot of game play, They are also too 'active' and they do not give us enough time to let us understand what we are supposed to learn from the Pacific Theatre, for example.  The FOV is horrendous, and while there is mod support, a game this advanced should have come standard with an FOV Slider.  The sound quality in general is not of the same fidelity as it was in the previous two games. Granted the engine is more 'advanced,' I liked the clip ejection 'ping' from the M1 Grand from the previous two games.  Conclusion:  I am thankful I got this was a part of the CoD War Chest bundle over Christmas 2015 rather than full price. This game is not worth your money since it takes so many steps back and tries to become an interactive movie instead. Very disappointed by the quality of this game overall. At least it looks pretty.",0
"One of the best in the series, with it's gore physics and interesting campaign as well as OG Nazi Zombies, possibly only being undone by Black Ops' presidential zombie defense mode.  I guess it's fun, but I wouldn't recommend getting it nowadays, as multiplayer's broken; it's basically turned into a snipefest.",0
I WANT A REFUND!!!,0
only good for zombies dont play multiplayer,0
"No longer works with Punk Buster, Unable to play online multiplayer at all.  It WAS a good game.",0
Don't buy if you want to play zombies with your friends. It doesn't work you can find countless people online complaing about this. I tried every thing I could find and nothing works. Regular mulitplayer works fine but zombies doesn't. Can't reccommend a game when half of it doesn't work.,0
"I've been playing this for a few eyars now and still can't decide if I like it, the graphics even by todays are great the story is immersive and the teamwork and AI are also well up to speed.  BUT  Its incredibly frustrating, for me games are supposed to be fun and this just isn't at times. The US campaigns especially are ruined by the sheer amount of bloody grenades and a gameplay is just hours of reading the 'watch the grenade indicator' caption. The lack of a savegame feature means if you don't hit a checkpoint you are doomed to relive the same bit over and over and over and over again to find after the 350th attempt (so it seems) you are just about there and you guessed it - bloody grenade!  TBH I'd give it a miss the frustration factor is just too much I'd rather a game that is actual fun not tedious and frustrating this is by far the worst COD game that I've played",0
"i only bought this for zombies. i hate cod. this one is one of the worst despite what fanboys might say. like all cod games the mp is uninspired, and more of luck/spray and pray based than any kind of skill oriented shooter. the single player is plauged by HUGE issues that should have dissapeared years ago, constantly respawning enemies until you reach a certain point, enemies spawning out of mid air (ive come into rooms only to be confronted by a lmg popping into existance out of nowhere in front of me, and the squad ai serves as only a distraction to the equally ♥♥♥♥ enemies. your squad seems unable to kill targets 3 feet in front of them and they constantly tell you to move up and complete tasks without any kind of covering fire etc. it breaks immersion and comes across as just plain stupid. hey you go shoot 3 tanks with an rpg while being nade spammed and rushed by enemies while we sit behind cover and let u do all the work! its uninspired and LAZY. its artifical difficulty. games are supposed to be harder based on clever design not constant nades every 2-3 second and useless ai that gets in ur way when you try to run away. ive been killed more times from being blocked by my squad than by making mistakes. its broken and stale. which is really dissapointing considering the interesting setting. i cant see why anyone would like this game when there are much better cleverly crafted shooters on the market that dont use nade spam as a crutch for difficulty. return to castle wolfenstien is a good example of a shooter done right. if u can get it on sale for the zombies mode it can be worth it as mods can make it its own game alone, however the base game (what the game is meant to be) is a 5/10 at best. poor design does not =good difficulty . ive been playing shooters my entire life and am a smfc in counterstrike. skill is not an issue. give this one a pass unless you like zombie mode, there are much better options, that are much more worth the money.",0

Bought it for modding. Worked very well for weeks. Very great. Until...... I tried hosting a game like usual. 'Can't Connect to our Online Address' This was odd so I tried to uninstall and reinstall it. No help. Verify Cache. Nope. Googled it. People had the same problems with little to no fix. Activision get your ♥♥♥♥ together. And btw. This applies to Call of Duty Black Ops as well. So I am thinking all CoD games have this problems. Don't waste your ♥♥♥♥ing time. Activision won't help you.,0
"For the premium price still demanded by Activision there should be more support by the developer. Controller support for one. The servers are a mess, punk buster is dated and there is no OFFICIAL support for the bugs it presents. It's a barebones port and its enjoyable, but it should sell for less than a physical copy on the xbox 360, with so much less to offer.",0
"After playing countless hours on Black Ops II, I wanted to relax and play some old school WaW zombies. Came with every zombie map in WaW. Zombies was really fun. I got to use the old World War II weapons on zombies, and people weren't lying when they said that World At War is probably the bloodiest and goriest CoD out on the market today. If only the Multiplayer servers weren't hacked and modded, I could have some actual fun playing multiplayer using WWII weaponry. There is literally ZERO vanilla servers, and it literally feels like I'm looking for a server in Garry's Mod.  I'll give this game a 6/10 due to multiplayer being terrible, but zombies are about the only thing you want to get this game for, unless you want to play on a modded/hacked server. Definitely not worth $19.99, or even $14.99, but probably like $9.99, which is when it is 50% off.",0

"Multiplayer crashes hard asf, although zombies is aight.",0
"Hello, if you are going to buy this game again after migrating from Xbox, please take a few notes. If you happened to play World at War during the next annualized release, at which point they stopped updating/patching the game and went on with the next, you'd know that even on consoles this game was riddled with hackers of all kind. Wallhackers, aimbotters, rainbow names and such. The game has not changed on PC, and they are doing nothing to stop this, so unless you have absolutely no soul I would completely avoid Multiplayer. Keep in mind the game is not entirely pointless to buy. Most get it simply just for zombies, and while there is no mod support it seems Treyarch is fine with custom maps and zombies-type gamemodes, but the downside is that there will be absolutely no vanilla servers if not playing with friends. This is kind of where it gets excrutiating after purchasing the game, as playing Vanilla was the first thing I wanted to do. Der Reise servers seem to be your best bet if looking to play vanilla, as it's such a good map that those who mod Zombies servers seem to not mess with it. Playing with friends seems to be one of the only ways to truly have fun, so if you lack the friends, either visit discussions and add someone or make friends with people on Zombies servers. As said before, do not even try to play multiplayer in it's dead state. There are little to no actual, true players in it anymore and I doubt there ever will be again. Even servers with no hacks on seem to have Double XP on, which completely ruins the build-up and fun of multiplayer in the first place.  Campaign: 8/10. Multiplayer: Dead, kicked into a ditch, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on and lit on fire. Many negative numbers/10 Zombies: 9/10, godmodders and such are present, otherwise vanilla it is one of the best games ever made.",0
"Possibly the last COD game set in world war 2, world at war is still just another generaic FPS like most COD. In fact this game has repeated scene from the first and second call of duty, and Medals of honor; Pacific Assault. But overall it's still a good game, especially the multiplayer and the first with nazi zombies. If your a fan of the COD, especially the original games, then this is a must have, and has some of the best controls of the series.  Also note mention is that it is a prequel to the first black ops COD game.",0
where is the zombies i can play multiplayer and story it says right here that i have to buy the gane and then pay more  money for zombies and that is not cool i should at least have one map but no i have to pay to play a game that i bought and only get multiplayer and campain i would recommend this game to any one who wants to get scammed and yes i have tried you tube before and it only tells you how to download the custom modded maps,0
well this game dose not work for me ive played it on my xbox 360 loved the zombies but the game wont luanch other then that it should be fine.,0

No other call of duty that I've played has had so many grenades being chucked at you. The only way to complete levels on this difficulty is to just rush through.  The sniper boss fight segment is almost impossible to do on the hardest difficulty as well and makes no logistical sense (the enemy sniper does not obey the laws of physics or any constraints of the human body in how fast he can get from window to window to ruin your day)",0

"This game is great on console, but if you don't have an amazing computer, it's a waste of money. There goes 20$ of mine down the drain becuase the framerate is so bad it's almost impossible to play (and i have all settings turned down) this game is just common for having awful framerate. (i'd prefer it on console) :(",0
it sucks      never,0

"Call of Duty: World at War is actually an okay Call of Duty game in my opinion. But I still can't love it.  Pros: + Explores the story of different factions during the war + AI are deadly + Gunplay and gameplay were fun + World War II setting + Love the Japanese soldiers. Tenno Heika Banzaiiii  Neutral: = Call of Duty = Generic FPS, altough fun in times = Voice acting is meh  Cons: - Call of Duty - Repetetive gameplay, hardly entertaining - Tiring like war. That should be a pro - Some checkpoints are stupid. Died to a flamerthrower trooper   instantly   (Meant to kill an 'important' person). Had to replay the level 5 more times...  Verdict: Call of Duty. Meh. 7/10     9/11 health-regenerating tanks. Really? Treyarch smoke dat kush, they let the flames burns like geurge bush       Originally posted by  author :",0

Got it on sale. Played multiplayer. Hackers. Funky colors on everything since they just mod everything. Quit. Played zombies. Barely anyone on. Hackers. Modded the gameplay so it wasn't challenging at all. Quit. Got a refund.,0
Cant host online zombies matches to play with friends.,0
If you buy this game for Zombies good your gonna have a good time with that. Multiplayer however is super trash and pointless. The online is full of hackers and high ping servers. You will not be able to have a good experience with it no matter how hard you try. Plus creating servers for just you and your friends is very diffcult and is not worth the struggle.,0
conection horrible  hackers almost in evry game vandi doesnt fix any bugs or exploit  on sale becuase no one buys it what more can i say?,0
"Stupid game,Dumbest ♥♥♥♥ing game ever.I bought me this game for 20$ just for the zombies i was so happy on playing zombies then this came:i wasnt able to find the zombie map selection i searched around the internet and found that german people arent allowed to play it since it has nazi.WHY TREYARCH ITS SO STUPID TO DO THAT.Result is i permantly deleted this game from my category.thanks treyarch for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off and throwing 20$ i nthe nowhere",0
I dont know whats wrong but im using windows 8 and for the game I cant look around like the mouse doesnt work,0

If you can find a fix, please let me know and don't buy the game if you have Windows 8 or 8.1. Recently afterwards, i re-ran World at War after a long period of time and it worked.

On the off chance you find an Australian server with more than 1 person in it every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ just camps in bushes, where it is impossible to see them because of the ♥♥♥♥ing awful model/game textures/colours/etc/etc. Every person in the game seems to have a fetish for 'crouch servers' where you literally get banned for everything from standing up, sprinting, killing an admin, throwing a nade, using a 'naughty word', I ♥♥♥♥ you not thats how the console described it. If the game was 4 dollars I would still seriously question buying it. Waste of ♥♥♥♥ing money. Got kicked/permanently banned from no less than 20 servers in less than an hour for, 'hacking', 'swearing', 'spamming chat' (spam has been redefined to 2 messages apparently), 'sprinting', 'jumping', 'glitching', literally anything you can think of I got banned for it. Single player, as with every cod is a waste of time and the only way to even play zombies is with console commands if you can't be ♥♥♥♥ed doing the ♥♥♥♥ campaign. Could rant more but why bother.

good but its ♥♥♥♥ how no one is playing it,0

I've tried the few suggestions people have made with no results, meaning no-one actually knows how to fix it.  Shame, I heard co-op zombies with the custom mapss is a lot of fun, but it seems that for some of us the game is just broken beyond repair.",0
Wow this game almost looks like COD BO3 on Ps3/xbox360,0
great game but trying to play zombies whit friends its kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ couse always my frind tries to join me its says this session is no longer available and theres really not that much about that error on internet how to fix it. the DISLIKE comes from zombies,0

This game may seem really good and all but it SUCKS. I spent 2 hours trying to get my friend's invite but nothing showed up. We played once but I was lagging like crazy.,0
"I was loving multiplayer on this game until I went on today and completely lost ALL OF MY PROGRESS, MY RANK, MY WEAPONS, everything. All I was told to do is back up my game next time. Instead of this problem being fixed I just get told to 'sux, backup next time lol'. Wtf am I supposed to do, redo all that grinding for my crap? Why hasn't this been fixed since 2008?",0
"This game is really bad, the only good thing is Nazi Zombies, and even still, when it lags and you try and change your settings so you can actually play it makes your screen freeze forever, and when you try and access your task manager it doesn't let you beceause World at war freezes your home page as well denying you from clicking anything.",0

I can't play co-op zombies with my friends 0/10 want a refund.,0

"How do you play Zombies?! I dont see an option it after downloading it. Some one please help. Also, controller support is only partial if your thinking about playing this game. With mods and hackers, you wont find any normal games to play. might request a refund if i cant find the Zombie mode",0

loved the game but no DLC maps to play on the other zombie maps I bought the zombie bundle and missing maps,0
this game is bad,0
If you love a game to play by yourself then go right ahead. If you love to play zombies or co-op campaign then have fun spending countless hours on google searching up a way to fix the sh#tty co-op problems that NEVER go away no matter how hard you try. P.S. Fu#k you treyarch for not helping fix this.,0
"After Treyarch spent most of their budget hiring mainstream Hollywood actors Kiefer Sutherland (better known as Big Boss in Metal Gear Solid 3, Metal Gear Solid 4, and Metal Gear Solid 5) and Gary Oldman (Die Hard), they were forced to reuse their art and sound assets, which meant a greater focus on the Eastern Front campaign. The Pacific campaign suffered as a result, being reduced to a paultry side story, leaving out the historic invasion of mainland Japan and the takeover of the Imperial Diet by elements of the US Marines. Not recommended for those of German or Japanese descent.",0
If you want to play this with some one on the same internet dont bother tried for over 24 hours on several occasions to get the game to work but every 'solution' fails. Don't waste your time.,0
Keeps Crashing for Me,0
Its not bad but those who play Fast Pase games. This sin't for you so I don't recomend,0
this game blows dongkey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,0
It is not fun. I am really happy that Steam added refunds,0

"unblievably awful pc port, only reviving factor is mods, and most are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥",0
No servers and crashes quite often.,0
Only worth for zombies. Even that gets old.,0
Why did i get this game??? ,0
"What to say about World at War? Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.  Now, you may be asking, 'Why is the multiplayer dead?' The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hickers and children. Hickers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hicker, another five are going to take that persons place.   The game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warfare 1, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review. Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and 'clean' of hickers and cheaters.  Some examples of hickers in World at War, are people who use:  Wallhickers Aimbots Instant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL Unlocks Hud-Hicking (Yes, it does exist) Instant VAC Ban  The Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in WaW that are safe.  Please, please, please watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.  I've heard that Search and Destroy games are safe, but the player count is very little in most game types.  If you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small. I wish all of you people luck.  Overall, get it for the spec-ops, and the singleplayer.  Edit: I no longer play WaW. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hicked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.  Stay safe, and play safe...and watch for hickers...  -Cheers   old cod better   0/10 (can I get it any lower??)",0
"I really enjoy this game apart from one thing which is forcing me to give it a bad review, when i was playing zombies with my mates we were on a high round and i needed to quickly search something on the internet, doing so caused me to 'lag out' and i was kicked out of the game! All you zombie players will know how frustrating that would be to get kicked out on a high level. If this gets fixed my review will be changed",0
multiplayer dosnt work,0
i used to love this game on xbox but do not touch this version there is almost no populated servers its insanly hard to find a zombies match with people and the multiplayer is full of a bunch of dooshbags who want you to crouch or you get kicked for playing the game you payed for the way you want,0
cant load the game with out it crashing,0
IT WONT LET ME PLAY ZOMBIES! ,0
COD:WAW is awesome but Personally I would still play it on console. The reason why is that it crashes for ANY i3 Processors right when you open it,0
The fact that on steam summer sale of 2015 this game is 25% off and still is $15 and says it was originally $20 when i bought it a year ago for $15 not on sale is why i dont trust activision and treyarch anymore.,0
idk i bought this 2 days ago and now its not working and i dont have a desktop shortcut anymore i like the game but it wont let me play it anymore,0
Absalout ♥♥♥♥ wont open £20 in the ♥♥♥♥ing bin. Go kill yourseld founder of this ♥♥♥♥ing game.,0
Crash fest,0
i cant find one zombies server this game sucks ,0
the game dosnt work ,0
Tactical pc master race ruined the game 0/10 would not crouch again,0
One of the biggest wastes of $ I've done. 2/10,0
Worst game ever. All the bad stuff of all Call of Duty parts combined in one sack of money-making cowpooop. Badly scripted and terribly timed 'action'. Unplayable. Unenjoyable. Strongly not recommended.,0
Too many hackers. I played this game for 3 hours and I still have not found a server with no hacker. THIS GAME ♥♥♥♥ING SUCKS!,0
"I bought this game because of the reviews. Don't believe them - this game is horrible. Btw - Kiefer Sutherland is your platton sgt in the first level. If you like this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yelling at you for a half hour, have at it.   1) completely linear - one and only one way to get through any and every mission  2) no matter how skilled you are, you will die and die and die again, until you follow the mission perfectly, the way they intend for you to play  3) lots of invisible walls and 2 foot hedges you can't jump over   4) lots of triggers based on your movement - dumb and dumber programming  5) you are the slowest runner and or crawler that has ever served in the military  6) invisible grenades come out of nowhere and kill you, even when every enemy within grenades-reach is dead (this game cheats like a btich - the enemy always knows your position, no matter how well covered you are, or how much stealth and time you take approaching)  7) I could go on, but why. I guess this would be a good game for unimaginative people who need to be hand held the entire time, and think a good game consists of dying until you discover the secret passage through each level",0
such a bad game. like playing atari. very cheap graphics.,0
"first of all ,from what i can tell punkbuster does not support this game anymore.you have to download some shaddy files from the the internet( pb setup legacy) or use a p2p service like (tunngle) or( hamachi) .which brings up alot of concerns because you dont know if your getting a virus from the the p2p connection or from the shaddy file ...dont download this game unless you have a thid party virus software installed .while the game itself is a great game, its not worth all the headache to get it to work. 'its better to go for black ops if your looking to play zombies'",0
The multiplayer zombies does not work,0
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME BECAUSE I SPENT 20$ ON IT AND ALL I GET IS A BLACK SCREEN WITH MUSIC AND NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"7 years later still more than 1000 player in game , the M P on this thing is something . but u cant find some 1 to play COOP Campaign mod , its sad becouse the Campaign on this thing is awesome .",0
"id recommend this game but not on PC. for those of you who are considering getting this game, STAY AWAY. it is dead. i mean, most of us buys it for the zombies, but you cant even find it anywhere! you might have better luck on ps3 or xbox, but world at war on steam is extremely problematic. yes, the idea of modded servers is fun, but good luck trying to connect and what not. bought it hoping i could re-live the glory days of high school, but was left extremely disappointed. stay away at all costs, ruined christmas for me. 1/10",0
pretty awful game,0
theres no zambies,0
"I miss the gore and sound of breaking bones and imapcts. Good one still, yet, cheaters like 100% aimbots, wallcheats, etc. are riding this one too as the CoD4 and no one does anything about it.",0
Treyarch and Activision can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves with their ♥♥♥♥ poor games and terrible excuses for a video game company. If I see any of you ♥♥♥♥♥ in the streets I am going to smack the color off your face.,0
how do u creat a profile,0
biggest peice of wank ever for your everday gamer just otter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to set up a game its lkike ♥♥♥♥ing rocket science pls give me my money back you you ♥♥♥♥ing game,0
"I've played World at War on Xbox, Playstation and now PC. I've had a positive expierence on both Xbox and Playstation but not on PC simply because it's way out of it's time and a joke to play. There's only a handful of servers with more than 2 people in them. I really would love to enjoy this game again but that won't ever happen again. At the time of writing this there's a whopping 419 people playing it. I figured it would have more active people on PC but I was wrong. On a plus note custom zombies maps are always fun to play around on. I would have rated this a thumbs up about 5 years ago. Rest in peace WaW.",0
can give my friend the game for free its his birthday,0
1.Spent the first 30 hours looking for lan fix so i could play zombies.  2.Spent the next 5 hours trying to get lan fix to work.  3.Spent the last 2 hours crying on my keyboard hoping for my $60 to appear in my wallet again.  Thanks Treyarch,0
This is so ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. they make the controls so hard to set for controler like what the ♥♥♥♥ who would like to use mouse and keyboard for a ♥♥♥♥ing xbox and ps3 game?,0
Day 1:It works Day 2:It works but the campaign crashes next level Day 3:comepletley Broke down  Would not reccomend it to a poor gaming computor.,0
I dont know why but it wont launch correctly and wont let me play ,0
not good you kill japs because ww2. since japan is better than america in every way this game i not like because not realistic bad.,0
this game gives me massive boners when i play with my willy haha lol m68 xDDDDD i really enjoy the exo abilities and how small my ♥♥♥♥ is haha anyway,0
A lot of Camping. If I could get a refund... I would.,0
"Don't buy this game and just watch the forums.  When the key problems are fixed and the Punk Buster isn't being completely... non-existent from the game's directory (causes a kick upon killing enemy players in online) then buy this game.  As it stands, I'm jealous that my dad can kill more than 1 guy without being kicked due to hte punk buster not ♥♥♥♥ing working. All i can do is campaign, which i've beated like... 4 times so there's no point, and there's zombies aswell.  Until those problems are fixed, this game is only worth ten bucks IMO in today's game market.   I would so love to ♥♥♥♥ing play multiplayer. Gee, this game's online is more unplayable than Sonic '06.  I'll give this... a ♥♥♥♥in... 4/10.  Because Zombies.",0
"Loved it on Xbox, but I have an error that I just cant seem to fix. I've tried uninstalling completely with revo uninstaller and changing sound.. The game has a black screen and has no sound.  If anyone has a fix to the problem, add me",0
Multiplayer no longer works without going through hell in modifying punk buster files manually. Will take you average 5 hours.,0
"this game is incredibly good but please dont waste your money, its overpirced and dosent work half the time",0
When I try and play the game it crashes. After doing some research this seems to be a common problem and no one seems to know of a definite solution. Do not buy this game. Treyarch continually ignores the pc audience. There are countless optimization problems and just all around laziness on the part of the developer when porting this game to pc. Steam has no warnings about compatability issues and a notoriously terrible refund policy. Don't waste your money on this overpriced 6-year-old broken piece of software.,0
"Casual review for a casual game. AI: 0/10 - they won't kill each other at the hard difficulty. Scripting death sequences and other ♥♥♥♥: 10/10 - Treyarch is good at writing scripts and stuff. Trickshooting: 5/10 Map Design: 7/10 - You can see poorly mapped areas, Treyarch probably thought that you ain't gonna see their messy mapping. Engine: 1/10 - As you know, they still ♥♥♥♥ IW3 engine, which was used in CoD4. Even more, it was used in Black Ops 2 (yeah, modified, still ♥♥♥♥♥♥), they'll probably re-use it in Black Ops 3 (cuz why the hell we should upgrade our engine, when Quake 3's still serves us good with our ♥♥♥♥♥♥ coding (gun with an attachment counts as different gun in the code, also haxers recode their cheats in no time, thanks for using same ♥♥♥♥ for many years). Overall: Minus 10/10.",0
this sucks,0
I want my monney back.  its really laggy i dont know how to get onto zombies (it will probably be to laggy to survive even with mods)  get it on your xbox 360 or ps3 and it will be much better trust me.,0
"Garbage garbage garbage garbage, this was the first mistake they made in the series and it lead to so many more. I loved Modern Warfare 1 so much and then this came out and made me very sad. Then Modern Warfare 2 came out and I was excited and then everything went to hell.",0
The Multiplayer is unplayable The campeign is excellent and if that is what you want then definetly get this game but the multiplayer is so ridden by hackers it is unplayable,0
"This game is pretty   avarage  .     Campaign is completely uninteresting, mediocre, avarage. Multiplayer is terribly balanced (otherwise it would be OK).  Singleplayer is as shallow and bland as it could ever be. There's literally no story, it's just a set of random missions that were selected from WWII history. It crashes every two hours of playtime. There's literally no player interaction in co-op, except for reviving. Characters are uninteresting. The only advantage of this game is the COD engine - thanks to which, the game plays smoothly and movement is very responsive.  Multiplayer is slowly dying, you'll only find a few servers that are left running. Most of them are meat grinders (remember 24/7 Operation Metro TDM in Battlefield 3?). The balance is completly terrible - there's no nuke killstreak, because submashine guns pretty much do the same thing. Tanks look good on paper, but in reality one of the factions always conquers all the tanks at the beginning of game, thus the other team already lost the game, because they're facing a squad of almost-indestructible camping tanks.  Customisation is almost non-existant, you just choose your guns and two perks.  Don't get me wrong - the game is NOT a disaster, it's not the worst experience ever. But it isn't anything great either and it could have been better with more effort put into right things. Also I don't find it worth of the money - even though the game is old, you won't find the steam version for less than 10€.",0
I thought this was a good game but i cant even open the f*cking game,0
"Waste of money, even with it being on sale.   Unless you can get it for $5, dont waste your time cause no one plays zombies anymore.",0
"i love this game , but when you play online ,punkbuster does not conform to this , which is a big problem and because of this i would not recommed .",0
"The game is meh, at best. It may be a really good game in 2008; but due to the excessive milking to the series, the online community has shrinked to a handful of full lobbies. You often need to disable punkbuster in order to play online. The only lobbies that you could play (really) is a crouch-prone only hardcore lobby, a boosting lobby (where you stand and let others shoot you), and the rare 'vanilla' servers.  If you want to play this game for its campaign, it is rather fun, but there is little replay value. Zombies, it is really fun, and it is better compared to the consoles, because you could enable dev's command and enable godmode, etc.  The only thing I liked about this game is that they gave out free maps, when on the consoles there are 3 DLC's for about $10(?) each. I wish that the game's community/playbase was more larger and alive. (This game was the last good and well-done ported COD game.) ",0
"Bought the game was hyped for it. When I wanted to go online IT DIDN'T ♥♥♥♥ING LET ME!! I tried to get in, but there was no solution. I searched everywhere in google to find a solution but no I got ♥♥♥♥ing scamed!! Wished I can do a refund. If i can please inform me.",0

"The story is very exciting,I like it,but the multiplayer is badly.Because there is almost nobody playing it.The health of enemy in multiplayer is higher than COD Infinity Ward series,not interesting like MW series and ghosts,even COD2.People who play it is less than COD2,so it isn't worthy to buy",0
"It's alright, but it gets quite boring after a while.",0
Worse game ever all ppl do is camp prone all day jerk each other off,0
Punkbuster wont let me kill anyone in multiplayer lmfao,0
I'm rating this bad because the ♥♥♥♥ing game de-ranked me!!!!!!!!!     But fun to play,0
"Cool game, too bad about the aimbotting AI.",0
i bought the game and it didnt come with zombies. so dumb!!!,0
This game is terrible because Russians are a playable race.,0
I tried to play this man I tried. But everyone on this game is such a try hard and I can't get any kills. I think the highest kill streak I got was 2.. ♥♥♥♥ING 2! And the movement in the game is extremely weird. I think I'm used to the new COD movements. And when I get in a gun ight with someone I aim right at them and shoot but they don't die. I think I'm only going to play this game for zombies.,0

"The online community is dead. there are very few servers with players, and the ones with players will have about 40 people. Guess how 40 people on a call of duty map works out.",0
This game is ♥♥♥♥♥.,0
I wouldnt recommend World at War for the simple reason that there isnt enough servers and game-mode variety. Every game is hard-core and you cant find a game in Co-Operative.This game was probably worth the money 4 years ago but now its nearly a joke for online which is where its most enjoyable.,0
I would recommend this but actvision seem to think that £1 = $1 so i recommend 1 of these 4 ways.   1. Waiting for it to go on sale on a website like  amazon.com  or any other website that doesn't use pounds this one would be the safest but you would be having to wait (or buy it off sale would still be cheaper).  2. Use a VPN this would be the more difficult one out of the 4 due to them being slow and finding one that you can use.  3. Get someone to buy if for you this is the way i did it but i would recommend getting a friend that you can trust to do it because get a some you don't know to do it they could easily take the money and run.  4. Buying it with TF2 keys this is be the best one out of the 4 IMO because people on trading websites like tf2outpost put trades up for it that use the price of it when its on sale (this only when the game is on sale)you also can buy TF2 keys for cheap from the community market its just finding some on outpost that is selling it for the sale price because of the websites crappy auto bump feature.  Its a shame because this is a very good game but i just cant recommend something that thinks that $1 = £1,0
"I bought this game on Steam to play Custom Zombies in combination with multiplayer... Zombies do work so far I've tested (just Der Riese so far) and than I tried out the multiplayer. That doesn't work, at all. If I launch the multiplayer a black screen appears and I have to reboot my PC because nothing happens, if I run it in safe mode the main menu layout appears but than again, it freezes and there is nothing I can do... And I'm not the only one. On the CoD WaW forum on Steam there are multiple people with the same problem: black screen. So my advice for this moment: Don't buy the game until there is a workaround.",0

this is a terrible game they make you play through the whole campaign so you can play zombies which is the real reason anyone would actually bye this game s so screw you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ,0
"+classic COD style game play +WW2 guns +dedicated servers   -Not much of a active online community as other modern CODs. -90% of servers are filled with bots or one of those stupid 'tatical' servers -Game play pretty much rips off COD4. -keither sutherland's annoying voice screaming all the time.  in conclusion, buy COD4 if u want modern COD games or COD2 if you want WW2 CoD.",0
it has a glitch where u cant play online,0

"Hey, are you tired of all the World War II FPS games? No? You will be after this. Boring, dumb, 'shock' singleplayer, a listless and awful multiplayer community.

"The single player campaign is pure garbage. The whole game is just tossing thrown grenades back at the enemy. The multi-player is nominally better than MW1. This is the game that made me realize each new CoD game is just going to be the same as the last one. Easily the best maps are the ones with tanks, but there's only a small number of those and nobody plays them anyway. And since Bad Company 2 exists and does vehicles (and everything else too for that matter) so much better, I can't think of a reason to ever play another CoD game again. It's a real shame to watch this franchise degrade from amazing, breath-taking experience to a lowest-common-denominator soulless unimaginative money-milking machine.",0
"If you like crouch servers, then you're litterally the scum of the earth.  Zombies is fun still to this day and all maps are free, but there is no multiplayer servers unless you're one of those people who love having their farts smelling like male sperm then there are crouch servers. Too many god damn crouch servers.   To the people who like crouch servers, thanks for ruining one of the best Call of duty game's in the franchise.  P.S   SCREW YOU!",0
this game has no volume it dosnt seem like that big of a dealbut when your playing zombies or anygame type you cant hear anything and your chance of death increases. From what i see this game has apsolutly no way to fix this you can watch tutorials but you'll just be wasting your time if there was a way to get rid of this game i wouldnt even think twice.,0
"A very poor game, especially for a WWII genre shooter which has been done right so many times. Right from the very first level you understand quickly how this is very far from the old call of duty games made by IW. God awful soundtrack, weak strory telling, dull weapons and a downgrade in graphics engine compared to CoD4 are the highlights that made the campaign an utter garbage.",0

"I would highly recommend this game to people I hate. Now let me be clear, I liked the console version of this game. It was one of my favorite games. The PC version makes me want to strangle myself with my xbox controller. Yes, I like using a controller. First time I made the mistake of trying to play the game I got an error message and had to reinstall the thing. That was the highpoint.  No one is on the servers. Maybe they are but if so they are doing a fantastic job of hiding themselves. I do not understand why you can join servers where no one is playing. I think most of my 'play time' is me waiting for things to work or looking at a bricked loading screen. Game is buggy as hell.  If you want a smooth console shooter experiance on the pc, look elsewhere this game is NOT FOR YOU.",0

This game is so boring and anyone who pays the money for this ♥♥♥♥ is a complete dumbass and should drink some ♥♥♥♥ing bleach and hand themselfs at the same time. You can't even play with your brother if you both had the ♥♥♥♥ing game! you would have to be on different ♥♥♥♥ing internet connections to ♥♥♥♥ing play I hate your guts and your ♥♥♥♥ing awful programing and I think that you should really improve your programming before you realease your game. COD ♥♥♥♥ing ghosts is better than this peice of worthless ♥♥♥♥ I spent my money on. Now I want a refund so that I can have my money back...

I would have to say that this game is definately one of my favourite games especially the zombies but it's far too complicated and time wasting just setting up the custom zombies and I can not seem to play with friends which is really disappointing considering I love playing zombies with friends! I've spent more hours finding out how to download custom zombie maps and researching how to play co-op with my friends (since it won't work) instead of playing the game itself. I liked this game but hated it since I couldn't even play co-op.,0
Only buy this if you want to play those god awful 'tactical' crouch servers only to crouch around like an idiot and get yelled at for running. Btw I just run. Don't spend on it.,0

this game is cool,0
im not able to play zombies why is that,0
put a work shop in this so we can easily download maps,0
why cant i play zombies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ,0
I just spent $20.00 on this game and it wont let me play it Srry mate,0
If you are looking to play custom zombies with friends dont buy this game because for some reason it will not allow you to join any invites and you would need to download something calle tungle (And tungle might be a virus) I hope this saves you a pretty penny!,0
The game is fun when you are playing with people who don't share the same internet as you. ,0
10/10 would fap to hackers again ,0

My version does not have zombies wtf this is why i bought it.,0
"I wrote no as my final answer although I was very in between: If you want this game to play online, whether it be TDM or War, this is not for you. The servers are all shut down and it's a pain in ♥♥♥ trying to find one that's up and running. If your buying this to do absolutely nothing but play by yourself, knock yourself out.",0
their is no zombies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,0
Play with your ♥♥♥♥ instead.,0
"I would highly recommend this game if you play zombies with friends all the time but if not then purchase with care. The game overall if great, however most of the game lobby you find is hardcore which I don't mind. The only bad thing is that the servers, because I played a couple game then got perma ban for no reason. Decided to play on another server.....an hour later perma ban again for no reason. So in the end I got perma ban from all the good populated good ping servers. If you are looking to play singleplayer or zombies with friends then yeah go for it, if not don't bother wasting the money.",0
I Really want to play this Game but it doesnt want to work,0
Peice of ♥♥♥♥ only wanted to play zombies figures out even tho the game has maps for it i need a mod downloads the mod says im not running the mod zombieX even tho i luanched said mod keeps saying session is no longer avalible now dragging nutsack thro a desert of broken glass and rusty nails is a better game 10/10,0
This game crashed on me while playing the Nazi Zombies co-op gamemode with my friend and i tried playing it again but it would say that it didn't quit properly last time and was asking me to boot into safe or not to. I tried both and both times it resulted in nothing more than a black screen. Someone please help if you have faced simmalar problems! ,0
Call Of Duty: World At War was a game which i thought looks awesome because of the Custom Zombies which i wanted to play  Unfortunately There is a launch 'bug' for me which sometimes freezes my computer or other times my tv would go to 'no signal'  Is it just me or is anyone else having this 'bug' as well?,0
zombies on pc is the only good feature  zombies: 10/10  game over all: 45.5/100,0

"Hmm, Apparently I played this game for 10 hours. I presume I finished it but for the life of me I dont recall.   It obviously didnt grab me in the way it should have.   One slight memory about this game was the level design was terriible. Lots of boxed in areas. Other than that... you have a WW2 game again....",0
♥♥♥♥♥♥ price for 2008 game,0
"The Game is an Older Game it is Fun in Solo and Plays good . Game takes a nose dive in CO-OP Play which is why I bought it , However it proved not reliable spent hours on blogs and discussion groups most having the same issues I believe in its hayday when servers were avaiable it might have been better but since there are not many servers supporting the coop play it just is more hassle the game refresh for servers also has some problems . Trying to get this to play Coop was a hit and miss normally a miss with continued failures with Friends Play . I Do not Recommned .",0
"Didn't like the game after some time, now I can't get a refund from it for the sale.",0
In my opinion this is only good for zombies &amp; not worth $20. The fact that you have to beat campaign in order unlock multiplayer zombies wasn't something I was thrilled about &amp; people dont play non-modded zombie maps. It's not super complicated to learn how to install what's needed to join in but it still doesn't make this game worth it with the few servers even availible,0
My game isnt working it says that it cant load a file and the disc is prob full even tho i have 756 gb on my card,0
There is no zombies.,0
Multiplayer is good. Campaing is good. FIX THE ♥♥♥♥ING CO-OP,0

It'd be great if you could actually load a Nazi Zombies session with friends and not have to restart your computer from the game crashing.,0
"As someone who couldn't care less about the Zombies aspect of the game the fact that every server is some lame custom server with the worst rules possible, this game is all but dead for me. I hoped that it would still have some more standard servers around that I don't have ridiculous high ping on. Anything over 150 is 110% unplayable, so if you live in the U.S. midwest and only want a WW2 multiplayer shooter, you're actually better off buying CoD 2.",0
This game sucks it costs 20$ and every time i run it it crashes it stupid,0
"World At War was fine... everything was going great! Until my game broke. The custom zombie maps that i download and play with my friends seems fine to them but to me, models are going crazy. Decals are going haywire. I barely can't even see with something blocking my screen. Gun models does not work and instead are like some sort of blackness covering parts of my screen. I don't like. And then comes the hosting problem. Whenever I try to host a game... I wait.,. and wait for some to join. BUT NOTHING. I have waited on one of my lobbies for over an hour and no one joined. I even went to eat dinner and by the time i come. No one has not joined. I don't even see anything in the chat. Btw... Chat glitch in the game. I can't see what i type sometimes and even in the lobby chat. DONT GET ME STARTED ON JOINING OTHERS... I cant. It doesn't let me. It keeps saying session is unavailable whenever i try to join a friend invite. They say they're still there but i can't join no matter what. It gives me a bunch of errors. I don't even know what to do... I uninstalled it and downloaded it again and still the same ressults.  Is there a refund i can have because i would actually love to take it back and buy it on something else on which it doesn't break down for me.",0
online wont work glad I got it when it was half price ,0
I hate Germany...   I can't play zombies because i bought Low Violence Version( And i didn't knew that Low Violence version does NOT include zombies.)! And steam doesn't want to refund me this game.,0
"Story is great Zombies is even better, But for ♥♥♥♥ sakes every single server on this game for multiplayer is hardcore after a while of playing hardcore it gets repetitive and becomes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because its who ever see's who first win's it only takes one shot to kill someone on every server it takes no skill at all i mean all you would need to win is a pistol, if your planing on buying this game for the multiplayer its not worth it also the zombie servers are pretty much dead #NoMoreHardcore Kappa",0
I wouldn't recommend this game mainly because I was VAC banned before I even did first time setup. Along with how bad community in CoD game typically are.,0
I have played this game a lot on the ps3 &amp; xbox 360 &amp; recently purchased it on steam as i was having craving's to play it again. first off the selection of mods is overwhelming &amp; i was impressed with the few that i tried. The main campaign game is much the same as the consoles. Where i was less than impressed was the lack of unmodded multiplayer &amp; nazi zombies co-op play that was available- which is basically non-existant. There seemed to be plenty of mod servers but if you are looking for the challenge that you got playing the classic nazi zombies or mult-iplayer i'm not seeing it here thus far...........,0
no online community,0
Bought it for the multiplayer found out punkbuster doesnt support this game anymore and 99% of the servers require the 'newest' version. So now i can only play on cracked servers when I payed for the game. So if you want this for multiplayer get a console version,0
TERRIBLE GAME. I won't even dignify it by playing it to the end.,0
"I bought this game played for a few days, tried to play it but it said i had to buy it again for $20 again after i bought it IF I WERE YOU DO NOT BUT THIS GAME",0
"This game is without a doubt an arcady first person shooter, just like Call of Duty is know to be. Simple mechanics, decent graphics, and semi accurate story (im not sure the characters in-game actually exsisted), and hey! The first Zombie mode (all WaW DLC maps included). Unfortunatly the ports to the pc arent always good and ive had multiple problems with this game since i bought it (2 years ago). for starters there are a few wierd problems with intel socket GPUs, i would not use it with them since there is a wierd slow down/ speed up when fps goes up and down like a yoyo (This might be different with the newer ones, since i used an intel HD 3000 with 6gb of 1333 sys ram. partly because the iris pro operates with a small amount of ESram, i suppose a ram upgrade would suffice.) But it seems to work with an FX 4100 with 8gb sys ram and a 2gb GTX 660 SC (super clocked).  Now last time i checked the multiplayer was almost empty, since the nature of call of duty is everybody moves to the next game and starts again. and MW2 was incredibly popular. So its hard to find a game online. Not to mention the majority are modded and i expect there are plenty of hackers waiting to prey on your patience, althought it would be completely usless for them.  Since this is the game that brought in the idea of zombie survival, there isnt much too it, compared to BO1/2. Border up windows get money kill zombies that get in, get money, buy new guns, kill more zombies. yadayadayda. Its the mode at its infancy and dont expect the full blown mode it is today.  In hindsight i would not have bought it. But hey! this is to help you guys/girls to decide. But it is my opinion, everyone is different. although the multiplayer being almost empty is a fact.   thanks and have fun!",0
"The only reason for this bad review is because of punkbuster, you cant play online and I have no idea how to fix this. I shouldnt have to fix there game I payed for.",0
Game does not work anymore. (properly atleast),0
THIS SUCKS NO ONE PLAYS MP ,0
Bad ping for aussie/nz players :(,0
"Dont bother, multiplayer doesnt work right of the start. And this is steam, I wont be bothered downloading patches and third party lan services to play with other people.",0
"It's not even worth buying it. Even though there is custom maps, no one really plays it alot. And why do you suddenly get the worst fps on it when it says 'Works great on intel core 2 duo' When I have Intel Core i3 on my laptop? I just have to spam the refresh list on Co-Op to see if anyone plays. AND MOST OF THEM ARE CUSTOM MAPS! IT TAKES A WHILE TO DOWNLOAD DUDE! Why can't you just host the original maps? I know the Mods feature was big, but everytime I would download a map, the Lobby would disappear cause it's been canceled! I mean like, Vanoss and other gamers play the game, why isn't there more people than expected? Even though PunkBuster no longer supports the PC version of this game, you can still host games! Why doesn't anyone even play it? Multiplayer is the only gamemode with enough people but what about nazi zombies? I've recently played this game and all I mostly see is custom maps instead of Regular maps. ",0
"This version of the game is basically buying a rippd or cracked version. First off the camplain is great and very fun and yes it does have its random bugs and glitches every once in a while just like any good game. Second the multiplayer is nothing like it use to be. Every map has either mods or hackers in it. Pretty much everyone only plays hardcore mode. And people will boost your prestige to max in some lobbies so it means you wont be able to have that fun experiance getting those levels up yourself. Third, There is NO multiplayer zombies. I repeat! NO multiplayer zombies unless you download some off steam program that allows you to technically illegally host a zombies match(steam allows this) and even at that, most of everyone has a closed nat type when you need a open nat type to play. Lastly, a lot of buttons wont even work, they either crash your game or just crash steam fully. And some buttons wont even take you to the right location of where it was suppose to go. SO! If you plan on buying this game for the multiplayer zombies! DON'T GET IT. Unless ofcourse you plan on playing by yourself then go right ahead.",0
No one plays this anymore :(,0
"As a single player game, it kinda sucks. The levels are 100% linear and confined to a narrow field of play. The player movement is actually very sluggish. It's hard to tell your opponent from your allies and the grenades are a total pain.  Maybe it's a good coop game or multiplayer, haven't tried that yet. ",0
I am playing the solo campaign and from what I read from the reviews it was hyped up as being awesome. I gotta tell you it is a load of bull. It is really unballanced and will cheat you at every available opportunity. It is so bad that it will have you laughing at it on the harder settings. I guess the multiplayer was great in its day but if you wanted a single player shoot em up then expect to be ♥♥♥♥♥ when ever the game suits and if you blink it will be over. Just too short for my liking.,0

"IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MULTIPLAYER, DONT GET THIS GAME. they have polite rules where u cant run, you have to be crouched, and you cant spawn kill. Ive been kicked for walking. Ive been kicked from every server from these rules. If you want this for zombies then its a good game but other than that dont get it",0
it never works and i can not find any real help on how to fix this unhandled exception error wich causes the game to not work really sad would not advise getting,0
Well i was excited for about half a month waiting for paypal to let me access my funds. Bought the game. spent hours downloading it on my poopy connection finally got the game installed. Started it. and apperently i cannot create an online profile. I guess other people have had this issue. There appear to be fixes for it. however i am stuck. im sure i would enjoy playing this game but im not a programmer... I give up. I would ask for my money back so i could buy MW2 or something else but i know that will not happen. soo I guess I paid for this review. Don't make the same mistake. get COD 4 instead.,0
its bad now,0
"Game is freaking great, but I had an issue which when I closed it, it was still labeled as 'Running' and I couldn't fix the problem, I contacted Steam Support and told them that this was happeneing, and I had Really only played an hour, and requested a refund, but this glitch cause the hours to stack as much as time passes, and that removed the chance of me getting a refund, great game, but just my luck, so I've been ripped off and can't do anything about it...  10/10 would glitch and get scammed again",0
The furer was not featured very often in this game,0
"In general this is a fantasic game but one problem that my friend and I had encountered ruined the whole experience. We were hyped to start playing so I created a lobby, send an invite......  Server no longer available!  After trying to fix this, there was no choice but to give up. If you want the game for solo play and pre-made online games (which is hard to find a non-modded lobby) I recommend but if in a case in which you want to play with friends, another platform with dedicated servers may be the best way to go.",0
"I spent hours working on the Veteran Mode difficulty setting, and was in the Reichstag. I signed off, and went to bed. The next morning, I found that all of my data was randomely wiped. I spent hours suffering through Polonsky's never ending whining, Roebuck and Reznov's cowardice (They never shot their guns in the campaign), a constant rain of grenades, being shot by nothing, clunky AI, useless grenades (all of which were my own), multiple heart-attacks, and a general lack of historical accuracy (The Battle of Shuri Castle never happened, and was not the end of the Okinawa Campaign. Roebuck and Miller would not have likely been sent home either, unless they were at Cape Gloucester or Guadalcanal, as they had not served in three campaigns). All of this was for nothing. I'll never get my fifteen hours back. While this may not be the game's fault, the host of other issues with the game have prevented me from giving it a favorable review.",0
i hate myself and i go to other steams and steal there to kids are dont do nothing,0
10/10 This game is Great It ran for 1 hour then crashed and now it crashes before I can even launch it. I searched everywhere and no one knows hot to fix it I re-installed did all that crap and nothing. Thanks Activision!,0
"Slight issue where it completely crashes my computer every time I try and start the game, this may be because of the specs of my computer But others have had the same or similar issue to me",0
"If you're like me, you bought this game for console when it first came out on console (way before you had the money to be a pc). The multiplayer was fun and the cooperative elements of the game lead to grow mostalgia for it. Unfortunately, the game hasn't aged well. The multiplayer community is fairly small now given the game's age. This leaves it to be slower paced, as the hardcore fans have stayed to play hardcore game types. It's small size also renders less moderation. Thus, many of the multiplayer servers are flooded with modders. If you're not a modder, you're probably not going to enjoy yourself as much as you would if you had bought the game when it just came out. Also, splitscreen for Zombies and Co-op Campaign is fairly tricky to setup on a pc, unlike console. However, the game is still as gritty as you remeber it.",0

"This game has problems, but it’s one of the best ones you’ll ever play. I have so many memories with this game on an Xbox, so I decided to get it here while it was on special. The game started on the first try, but it’s a hassle to find a legit multiplayer game. Zombies are fun as always, but you will not find a lot of multiplayer games so get yourself some friends or play it solo.   Pros: Mods Amazing Campaign Multiplayer Zombies  Cons:  Does not save my online multiplayer progress, so I’m always starting from private Random crashes Not much zombie’s servers Multiplayer is full with modded maps and some hard to find legit ones Bluescreens on my PC  Game will sometimes not even open and stay in a black screen  You’ll waste way more time trying to fix all of these problems than actually playing, so get ready to read some 7 year old forms and going to some outdated websites no one ever goes to anymore.  This is an awesome game, but its way too complicated on a PC. I’ll rather play it on a console to just keep it sweet and simple. ",0

"I have mixed feelings about this game. It's better with friends. Without friends, you have nobody to talk to, nobody to tell what you're planning on doing. It's lonely. The graphics are excusable.

My friend and I are experiencing something wrong with joining using Co-Op on the campagn mode. We've tried hosting lan and online games with no luck of joining. I've search this online to see if there was a fix. Sadly, there isn't. I've tried disabling firewall and much more with no luck. All I get when I join is this session error, ' Trying to join potential matches ' and it never joins. It is very dissapointing seeing a really good game having an error like this.",0
REVIEW FOR PVP: I played this game for years on console it is by far my favorit call of dutty and still remains same on pc.  The game breaking problem that pains me about this game right now is that you can't find players that are not on a modded server and punk buster usually kicks you when you find a decently playable server for some reason.,0
Wouldnt reccomend at all  Just get Black Ops with all the DLC'S.  Multiplayer is full of hackers Can't play zombies with friends Its just broken.  Campaign is good but if you want to play with friends don't get. Just get Black Ops,0
"Played it for 2 hours... Now it just crashes. It's odd, but it think it happened after adding acreative sound card",0

"I had some trouble at first getting multiplayer to work. After some time servers started showing up to refresh. Seems to have enough servers for multiplayer and is a good classic CoD game. Hardly ever any zombie games. The multiplayer servers are often empty or seem to require certain files. Some few servers have team deathmatch, but the multiplayer community is a huge dissapointment. Most of the cool servers i tried to join always kick me after i play for some time without telling me why. Only team deathmatch available. . . Sometimes fun, but you cant play splitscreen or with controllers without xpadder either on here. . .",0

In the end, I decided to work on a completely new object. Much less complicated. Now, I'm running out of memory as well as getting the crash when I try to use the AUTOPO feature to create a UV. My machine has 8gb memory... so I have no idea how it's running out.  I'll recommend it when the frequent and sadly predictable crashes are fixed.",0

"None of the games work on my pc. (Windows 7 corei5) The original game is replaced by the 1990 vga remake, but that doesnt matter because none of it runs anyway. Viewing the forums shows many many people with the same problom. Buy the GOG versions instead. Stay away from this trashy non-port.",0
I bought this solely for Kings Quest 6 to relive my nostalgic glory days; unfortunately unplayable. The game will bug out at when you meet the court jester; reloading a saved game does not solve the issue. Accessing the top options bar doesn't work as well. I can't comment on the other games in this series. Big let down. I've had the collection for about 2 years now and they haven't released a patch or update. Skip this; buy from GOG or find the original CD-ROMS on Ebay.,0
"Ugh. I hate not being able to recommend this game.  I love the King's Quest games. They were some of my first RPG's. The stories are wonderful, puzzles challenging, and characters interesting (please caveat this with the fact that these are all older games; you're not getting massively in depth here).  However, this edition just does not work with my computer. The graphics are off, it doesn't play right, which makes it a disappointment.  I ended up downloading the games (plus KQ8: Mask of Eternity, which is not included in this set) from  GOG.com  for the same amount it's available for on Steam regularly.  Great games, just not through this edition.",0
"Be warned, some of the games are unplayable. For King's Quest IV (Perils of Rosella), it requires a security code to start the game. You have to look up the manual online and try to figure out the security code. Without page numbers, this is nearly impossible. The manual that comes with this game bundle is for the whole game bundle, so it isn't the right one.  For King's Quest VI, the game has so many glitches that it hangs up and becomes unplayable. You can look on the forums for more details on this.  Kings Quest VII won't even launch. It just gives an error message.   I loved these games years ago and wanted to enjoy them again. Sad that I can't.",0
I only finished KQ5 yet but i feel the need to write something down here. These games were available in more languages than one but somehow they won`t support anything but english. Activision created a shameless port here just using the worst settings of DOSbox to bring these games to modern systems. No work was put into this and therefore doesn`t deserve any credit.,0
"The games are enjoyable to play. Brings back some good memories. However, KQ 7, the princess bride would not play. The patch updates I downloaded did not help. If the it states that the game is able to play on XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8, then it SHOULD.",0
"Pros: ? Cons: ? Summary: I can't review this because it won't run properly. Despite this being a nearly universal problem with seemingly every customer, there appears to be no care or effort to officially fix this. So, basically, if you want to be defrauded for about $20, then buy this game collection. If you have an ancient machine, you don't have anything to worry about.",0
this is a total rip off and i'm ♥♥♥♥in ♥♥♥♥♥♥! you can barely play any of the games.. how can you charge some one for nothing?,0
"Not long after buying Kings Quest my computers were upgraded to Windows 7 and the game hasn't worked since. I hear a new version of Kings Quest is coming, doesn't say if it is for PC or just all the consoles.",0
Awesome games but none of them work properly in the steam version,0
Does not work on new computers.,0
Sadly most of the games work properly but I bought it to be able to play kings quest 7 but I guess it doesnt work on my computer. =[,0
Crashes my computer.,0
"Why is this even for sale still? Windows XP, 32-bit, only. An out of support operating system required to play it reliably. Why not just sell the original DOS versions instead?  Same applies to Space Quest collection and the Doom releases....",0
"No one is really going to buy this game because of a review of the game itself, not decades later.  So my review isn't about the games themselves (which are great)  My review is about the package they're selling.  This is a dosbox emulation of a free collector's edition game that came with King's Quest VIII. I thought it'd be a proper, redone collection. It's not. It barely works, and I feel ripped off.  If you want this game, go to  gog.com  instead. Specifically here:  http://www.gog.com/game/kings_quest_4_5_6   They have better compatibility, and a 30 day money back guarantee. I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when I found out it was just a crappy emulation, but there's literally nothing I could do.  This is a bad purchase.",0
"Does anyone have suggestions on how I can play Kings Quest 7 on Windows 8? I had success with 1-6, however when clicking 7 it says I cannot play on this PC. I tried installing the most recently suggested patch from below, but that caused all of them to not work until I uninstalled the patch. please HELP! the only one I was most interested in playing was #7 and of course it happens to be the only one that wont seem to work with Windows 8  Edit: I guess I should have read through the reviews in more detail. It is a shame that Steam offers this when it is not compatable with any new computers for KQ7. They should reduce the price and advertise it for KQ 1-6. Anyone know how to request a refund?",0
"Technical glitches. I'm playing this on a brand new computer running Windows 8.1. Here are the issues I've had.  I played KQ1 through KQ4 mostly without problems. Except, when I started playing KQ1, there was a major video glitch every time I opened and closed the Inventory screen. It was really annoying, and while trying to solve the problem, I discovered that KQ7 wasn't working at all. I am diligent in protecting my computers from viruses and destabilizing programs, so I very reluctantly downloaded the software patch discussed in this forum, and was really annoyed to find it installing multiple programs. Since my hard drive is new and has little on it, I plan to reformat it once I finish playing Kings Quest.   The patch seems to have made KQ7 work, but I haven't actually played it yet. It did not solve the video glitch problem, which I tolerated through KQ3. One option is rather than opening the Inventory screen, instead type 'Look at (inventory object).' KQ4 ran smoothly. Then I got to KQV and discovered the biggest annoyance yet.  Sierra originally released two versions of KQ5 - a floppy-disk version followed by a CD-ROM version released a year later. The floppy version uses text windows to describe everything in the game, but with the CD-ROM version, they experimented with voice overs. The version in this package is the CD-ROM version. The voice acting is absolutely terrible and they do not give you the option to revert to text boxes. Every time you look at something, a narrator describes it for you in a cheesy radio announcer voice, and the character voices are intolerable to the point that I don't want to play the game.   So, I considered skipping ahead to KQ6, and discovered a problem there too. The game uses a program called DOSBox to make old DOS games compatible with newer computers. You have to run some basic configuration for each game, in the process choosing whether to run it in a window that cannot be resized or full screen. I don't want to play in a window, but the full-screen setting stretches the 4:3 aspect ration to fill my rectangular monitor, and I cannot figure out how to make it display 4:3.  So, I'm thinking I might just stop here and stop playing. It was fun playing KQ1 through KQ4 after all these years. I'd been playing Skyrim for a while, and it was a trip to see the old-school graphics that took me back to my high school days when I first played the games. It seemed to me like Skyrim might have taken a lot from King's Quest. I haven't played other Elder Scrolls games, so I don't know the history there.  One other thing you should know. I was looking forward to experiencing the old-school graphics and was ironically disappointed to find that the version of KQ1 included in this package was not the original, but a re-release made years later utilizing updated VGA graphics. While the graphics obviously look nicer, it made it hard to experience the full nostalgia I was looking for. Sierra was criticized for remaking the game and decided not to remake any other games. The idea was that they were ruining a classic, like colorizing a black and white movie.",0
"King's Quest 5 is the first point-and-click adventure game I ever played way back in the far off time called the 1990's and I was immediately in love with the genre. I might just be a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but the games seem boring and look like total ♥♥♥♥ that make my eyes hurt. I know there are fan-made re-makes of some of these games with updated visuals. Try those if you're really curious about these games, but otherwise just stick with newer games if you're a fan of the genre. These games are also from the era when Sierra made games that if you didn't get a certain item and left the area, the game would be unwinnable as you couldn't go back to get that item you need to keep progressing. And this was all done so you'd have to call their pay hint line when you got completely stuck and didn't realize you had no way of figuring out the unsolvable puzzle. No wonder they went out of business. Those ♥♥♥♥♥uckers.",0
"It pains me to not be able to recommend this collection because the games themselves are fantastic. However, they simply do not work 'out of the box.' The launcher presents the player with a menu that allows him to select which game to play. Zero out of six of them will work. Zero. Having said that, I was able to figure out what was wrong and get the games to work on my own, bypassing the launcher, within five minutes. That is only because I have extensive experience with DOS. Most people have little to no experience with that antiquated beast and simply will not be able to figure out how to get the games working on their own, nor should they have to.   It is simply unacceptable for games that do not work to be sold as if they do work. It is quite literally five minutes worth of work for Activision or Valve to get these games working. It is not the responsibility of the buyer to fix the lazily misconfigured junk that is being sold here. If people pay money for a working game, that's exactly what they should receive.",0
Great games. Too bad they're delivered via a misconfigured DOSBox. For $20 you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can do some actual work.,0
"Great. Whoever put this together can't even make DOSBox work right through a simple launcher, making the game require manually going in and configuring things correctly to get it running. Goodbye convinience factor.  Also, what the hell with not including the original non-VGA SQ1?",0
"Very buggy - All of these games freeze when you die and try to restore, rather than having to start over. Space quest 6 crashes during initial load-up. Loved this game as a kid, but this release of it is super disapointing, its barely playable.",0
"I recommend SQ3&amp;4 but better to get the collection on GOG - you have the option to only buy half, it uses a better version of DOSBox (albeit still misconfigured just as here, but it runs best in SCUMMVM anyway). It's also not region locked on GOG as it is here.   Most importantly, the GOG version can be more easily accessed on alternative platforms.",0
"Very sad to say that none of the games will work. I loved these games when I was a kid and was really excited to see the whole bundle on sale. Unfortunately they are not configured to work on any modern PC. It is possible to work around this and load them through a properly configured DOS Box, but this takes some effort. It just relfects pure laziness and negligence on the part of the dsitrbutor who could have done so with minimal effort but preferred to just take peoples' money instead.",0
"Apparently, there is a hardcopy decoder that shipped with the CD waaaaaaay back in the day when this game was new. No one bothered to tell Steam about it, or to provide it to the player. As a result, I can't get past the first few steps of the first game. MAJOR FAIL. That's just ridiculous.  Playing Space Quest I, I can't even get out of the ship before it blows up. I tried EVERYTHING. I even resorted to trying every combination of wierd symbols on the cartridge device. In the game, there is a guy that dies and his last words are supposedly tied to this cartride retreival system that has some buttons with symbols on it. Presumably, the player has to enter the symbols that correspond to the words (and there's several words that are cycled through as you restart. over and over and over again). HOW IN THE EFF AM I SUPPOSED TO TRANSLATE THE WORD INTO WHATEVER SYMBOLS?  I finally caved and Googled the walk-through. That's when I found out about this decoder that shipped with the CD as some 'copy protection' wierdness. Luckily someone out there saved it and I can decode the message.,,,, Just ridiculous. I haven't even bothered to continue the first quest outside the ship - this whole debacle leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Steam should have known about the bizzare feature of the game and provided a PDF or something.,,,",0
Awesome games but none of them work properly in the steam version,0
"This game brought back many good memories, but, does not work. Very unhappy about it. Steam should warn buyers that a bit of work needs to be done to run the game and that it will not work through steam. 'Naughty' for making a quick buck.",0
"You can buy this game collection to own the games legally and most of them are quite good, in part hilarious. Unfortunately in doing so you pay for software that simply doesn't work without you updating and configuring DosBOX. The website 'Sierrahelp' holds some patches you may want to install which aren't installed in the Steam version of 2016 even though they were released years ago; they also help with proper DosBOX setup, however you still may want to manually tweak the configuration files. Beware, parts 2 and 3 from this collection are not available in VGA and require keyboard controlling instead of mouse support which is a bit too 'classic' for my taste. However, there is a fan-made VGA version of Space Quest 2 that is really well made and even has acceptable voice acting! To beat Space Quest 6 without an online walkthrough you require some extra manual (used as a form of copy protection) that was forgotten to include in this collection! So, have fun spoiling parts of the game with a walkthrough!  All things considered the games are funny and worth playing even decades after their inception, but this collection is so badly executed it means you buy tedious work.",0
Bought the game... feeling nostalgic... thinking.. at last.. gonna play all... I only finished 5 and 6. Ups.. game doesnt work.. try again... nope... again... nope... again...  again... again.... again... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO lost of forums later..  uninstall the game and ask for a refund!,0
"So nobody will read this as the game is around 20 years old or something.  However i'd like to write that it is a disturbing trend that 'old school' games are being rejuvinated and made available to the modern gamer and tagged with a rather hefty price too.  Was this game (or series of games) worth the value? Absolutely not. Why did I buy the game then? You may ask this rightly and the answer is entirely sentimental. I loved the genre of game in its hayday and played this series of games with a fondness that is nearing reverence. As such, reliving some of my lost childhood was probably justifying the price paid for the Space Quest collection.  Imagine my deep disappointment then when trying to start any one of the games in the collection only to be met with the void of game failure. That's right folks, the games don't work. I'll reiterate for clarity: they do not work!  As a result of this I have come to the very sorry conclusion that no longer will I ever provide Valve a penny to relive some of my lost childhood memories. The price is already ridiculous and the value to cost ratio is further pushed towards a level of disgusting by the fact that the games simply don't work.  Feel free to return my money steam - i'll give you the game back.  So. In summary:  - game collection is too expensive - game doesn't work - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t",0
Does not run on modern systems. Somehow they've buggered up the dosbox config. So you'll need to fiddle around with this. Or just get the GoG version...,0
I was so happy to see this offered on STEAM because I played the hell out of these games 20+ years ago. Yet when Ioaded them up.. they all looked worse on my new computer than my old 25 year old copies of the same game.  WTH?? Why are the graphics so messed up. They looked better on my 16 color EGA! Even the VGA Sq1 has severe graphics glitches. Is there ANY way to fix this?,0
This is a joke. How can they even sell this in the Steam store? I paid for some badly configured dosbox? This should be removed from Steam.,0

"I have played the non legacy versions (which I assume are the more modern versions?) of 1, 4 and 5.  Space Quest 1. Could not play, it looped the intro over and over. Space Quest 4. If there is loading it takes forever and there is a lot of loading. Also the cursor keeps flickering. Played it for a few minutes and then got annoyed. Space quest 5. See 4, same loading issues but a little bit less often and long. Same cursor issues. I have played this for 2-3 hours and it seems like a very fun game but the loading is taking to long (there is sometimes even loading when just looking at an item or wall!)   Also in general you can not change resolution or scaling. So you are either stuck on full screen with horrendous pixels or stuck in a very very small window. If you alt tab and tab back again the game goes in windowed mode. There is no button to switch. (alt+enter switches)  Fix the loading, cursor flickering and give me a scaling option for windowed mode then we talk again. Right now, I deem this unplayable.",0

"Aces of the Galaxy is a vibrant rail shooter. The gameplay is very accessible and combat is hectic, and enjoyable. The difficulty levels feel pretty appropriate, however there is even a challenge on Easy mode.   The biggest complaint I have, whether by design or not, is that there is no save state for progression. Every time you exit the game, you and return, you'll start right over. Now this could be an homage to the classic arcade style that this game represents, but for most modern arcade games, a save system is really a requirement I feel. Not having the ability to continue is why I would not recommend this game.",0
"I cannot recommend this game - it just doesn't work, and the support for it is horrible. I have seen some people who seem to be able to get it to work, and I wish them all the best. For me, it gets to the menu, I cna select a ship, but when I click 'Play', it hangs. Music still plays, but no game. Worst of all, I can only kill it remotely, because it completely takes over the desktop - try to CTRL/ALT/DEL and you can't see task manager because the game is in the way. Can't minimize it. Can't ALT/TAB, because the instant you change windows, the game takes back over again.  And the support. What support? Steam has nothing in the way of support for this game, so far as I can tell. They say contact Activision. Activision has no reference to this game on their site anywhere, and you can't submit a ticket for anything that's not on the site. There is no generic way to contacxt support except Twitter, and so I am now engaged in a days-long Twitter conversation which has barely gotten past the 'have you verified your game cache' stage.  It looked fun, but don't risk it. NOT WORTH THE RISK TO BUY.",0

"Cant really recommend this game. Gameplay is repetative and uninteresting and the controls are hit and miss. looks and sound are good enough, but the game isnt worth your money, there are free flash games out there that are better then this",0
"I suppose it is an okay game but..  Fun? Yes it actually is and not too difficult either and kind of refreshing.  No saves? I do not have a lot of time to play and there´s where the lack of a save option stops me from playing further.   Gaming gear used: There was also a problem with my logitech rumblepad, I had to disconnect it to get the game working properly. I had it plugged in for another game but obviously this game does not like that. I used my mouse and keyboard for this game.  Recommend: No. If it only had an autosave/save function then I´d would have voted positive surely.",0
"Aces of the Galaxy is a competent game that gets on my nerves. Aces reveals console-port-itus by making it impossible to change the controls ingame, and if you have a 360 controller hooked up expect to get lots of rumble you can't do anything about. I was attracted to Aces because it looks and plays a bit like Rez HD. You can move side to side and dodge, but you have no ability to change your path. When executed well, this can be alot of fun. However, shooting in Aces is accomplished by clicking the mouse button instead of holding it. Within the first few minutes of play, I encountered swarms of enemies, and I do mean swarms. You can fire missiles by holding the right mouse button and dragging it over your enemies, but the recharge for this ability encourages you to click away with your guns, and this quickly becomes a pain. Outside of gameplay, two more issues quickly made the experience intolerable. Firstly, the majority of the enemies arn't well-differentiated from the background, the shots they fire back at you, or thier own vapor trails. The result is an incredibly busy, confusing, and deadly mess, and that's before you start adding your own shots to the mix. Secondly, I quickly encontered a piece of music that was ear-splittingly painful, and while I could certainly turn off all the music, I really don't see the point of playing a game like this without decent beats. This is obviously a subjective review, so I encourage you to examine other sources.",0

"It feels like playing a third-person version of Space Invaders, when you can see it.   There's a reason Aces of the Galaxy sits at 'Mixed' in it's reviews: it's not for everyone. Certainly it's not the type for me. While there is something to be said for 'On Rail Shooters,' I cannot say that Aces makes the best of this particular style. In particular, Aces makes use of many many brilliant colors and explosions which happen in such frequency that seeing what is happening is a challenge.  Overall, I can't say that I was enjoying Aces. Had it been a third-person version of Space Invaders, I might have had more fun with the idea, but the novelty of such an idea is hampered by the rail.",0
"If you're using an i3, i7, Intel Xeon, AMD FX 63xx, FX 83xx, or FX 92xx, or an i5 laptop, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.  Any processor that supports hyperthreading will make this entirely unplayable. Shaders will not load. Polygonal stretching/artifacting is frequent and highly distracting. Objects will clip out of existence from either getting close or getting far from it, revealing the out-of-bounds areas or making NPCs simply float in mid-air. No settings will fix the bug and no fix (other than disabling hyperthreading in your BIOS... hell no) is available. It also has severe stuttering problems, and according to some online sources the bad performance is an AMD specific bug that can't be fixed.  Even more than that, you can't brute-force your way through the game and ignore your problems. Even when you look past the invisible tiling and exposed out-of-map areas, the true game-ending bug is when your UI breaks and a giant black hexagon covers a good chunk of the center of the screen. This makes it near-impossible to aim. Just go play Singularity.  The game itself is interesting and very enjoyable from what I've played, and if not for these shader bugs the Quake4-ish visuals hold up perfectly... but like the original Far Cry or Grim Fandango, the first big challenge is figuring out how to duct-tape the messy, outdated code together, and as of yet I haven't succeeded. Will update review if a solution can be found.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837039396   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837037829   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=837037490 ",0
"Timeshift is the prime example of a good concept (time manipulation) badly rendered. The story in itself is utterly slim and unattractive (and with quite the erratic narrative) : a scientist, Krone, decied to found his own empire in an alternate timeline and you go after him. The end. No surprises, no twist, no incentive to continue.  The hero is a soulless mute, joining the Resistance just because and being ordered around, while nobody bats and eyelid at a suit guy appearing from nowhere and able to manipulate time around him. There's a grand total of two timejumps !  But well, story is not meant to be the strongest point of a FPS. Problem is, the gameplay is also lacking. Not that it plays badly- on the opposite, it plays quite smoothly. But the game is far too easy. Your ability to slow time, combined with the quick regeneration of your health and a genous cooldown for time-controlling abilities, makes you near-invulnerable if you stay cautious. The game compensates by unleashing hordes of brainless soldiers, but it just makes the fights longer, not more interesting. The puzzles are short of anything creative. A puddle of electrified water ? Stop the time, the water is solidified, go unscathed. The bridge is collapsing ? Activate return, walk on it as it goes back in time for your needs. It won't challenge your intellect, rest assured.  The weapons feel good, especially the explosive crossbow, but in the end you feel like you spend most of your times pushing buttons and going back. Cooke, the leader of the Resistance, yelling at you every twenty seconds in some sections till you accomplish the objective is quite unnerving.  The game is mercifully rather short- about 8 hours, without replay value. In a way, it's quite soothing because you stomp the ennemies with your arsenal and slow time capacity, but it was really clunky and uninspired at the time, it's not better now.  If you want a FPS with the Time them and a good dose of humor, try Time Splitters : Future Perfect. Else, even Singularity is more convincing than Timeshift : at least you interact with the world, you're not a mute puppet in a suit.  Surely Saber Interactive is doing better now, but then they have also produced Battle Los Angeles... Not the brightest past.",0
"I don't typically write reviews. I also understand TimeShift is older but its impossible to run on modern core CPUs without the hassle of turning off hyperthreading in the BIOS. I write this negative review only as a warning to those interested in buying the game. TimeShift itself is actually really fun and I hate to taint the review status because of this issue. However, Steam should really warn people of these problems before selling a product. Out of hundreds of games I own this is the only one that I have to do this with in order for the game to work. Such a pain in the %^#!",0
"I loved this game when it came out, and remember playing it on my old laptop. unfortunately, with my PC this game is unplayable. it doesnt have support for newer hardware, and it's now an unplayble wreck. I had to request a refund, because I just can't play this game",0
"Don't look at my play time. I used another exe (not for this game, obviously) to get 5 minutes to write this review. Maybe my review would help somebody.   Game doesn't work if you have Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 x64",0
"So i did some research and found that this game crashes if you enable interlacing, which is something that has to do with your gpu and how it streams its data that almost every modern gpu uses by default, which has to be changed in the B.I.O.S. Which makes it confusing how I managed to play about a half an hour of this before it crashed in game, and loading a save only made it crash again during the loading screen, and the community seems to not have a fix for it. Starting a new game also didn't work in case you didn't think I tried. Downvoting until i hear it's fixed, odds are with a game this old now it will never happen. Really fun though, controller pretty much necessary.  Edit: So I looked at this review and realized that I pretty much didn't cover any of the game I actually played, so in short, it has some decent puzzle elements, like stopping a fan blade over a death pit and walking across per say, or walking up to a dude, taking his gun and punching him in the face. You would not believe how much fun that is until you try it. I've played through most of the game on my friends ps3, which is why I picked it up, however I'm still dissapointed that there isn't a solution for my problem no matter how hard I look, considering my BIOS is apparently crap and I don't have interlacing options. This is a good game, and I reccomend picking it up, just not on PC, I hate to say it.",0
"This game is the dictionary definition of mediocre. While there is nothing blantantly wrong with it, it does not excel in any department either. Being able to control time at will sounds like a great mechanic but it is poorly implemented in this game. During combat all you need to do is slow down time and you become virtually untouchable. which takes away any sort of tension during firefights. It seems the develepers tried to account for this by making enemy fire highly lethal (meaning a couple of shots to the face and you're dead), and by having enemies ambush you -- as if they come out of nowhere -- resulting in constant reloadings back to the previous checkpoint. Even having purchased this game on sale I cannot recommended it since, despite giving it an honest try, it offers no entertainment value. ",0
"I honestly do not understand how others can give such good reviews, though that may be explained by the fact that EVERY negative review, no matter how well founded and well written is marked as unhelpful, when many are very accurate. I found this game clunky and quite silly in some respects. A major issue I had is the number of bullets you must put into enemies, though there is at least enough ammo dropped to refund you there. But when it takes vital extra seconds to make sure they're definitely dead after that nearly 20 bullets point-blank, that then causes you to die repeatedly from the sheer volume of AI surrounding you, that each seem able to severely cripple you, then it becomes rather annoying. The controls are not exactly set up the best as default either, and it doesn't help when you have to use those strange controls to stop the game using the 'amazing' time powers (which are not able to be utilised as well as they could) for you and wasting the charge on them, as well as throwing off any rhythm you manage to achieve. Overall, though it has potential to be enjoyed, and I am sure many can, I do not reccomend it for those reasons, as I believe that it has not the quality to have enough fun to be worth it. Feel free to try, however, as it may get better later in the game. I couldn't bother to continue after a while.",0
"I tried changing the FOV (the default is 56) and it glitches the ♥♥♥♥ out of the game any time I try to. I got this on sale for $5 but it kinda sucks because I can't play with an FOV lower than 80 without motion sickness. If you can deal with 56, then it might be for you because the gameplay isn't that bad, but I simply can't recommend it for that reason.",0
"I could only play three levels of this game. I think by that admission we know where this review is going.   I don't know why I bought this game, if it was in a bundle, or if I mistook it for another time game, what ever the reasons, I wish I could give it back. It's not that it's a horrendous game, but with a name like Timeshift, you have a lot of great possible features that will blow a players mind.   This game though doesn't do any of them. This is a very by the numbers shooters with a time power that is almost mandatory. In the first three levels, you constantly feel overwhelmed, but the time power doesn't really make up for it, a lot of this game is use the time power, shoot a few people, hide again wait for the time power (And health) regen, do it again.   The abilities you have in the game are interesting, but the game overall is quite uninteresting. The story is weak, the gameplay is about the same, and the graphics... well the first level is a dull grey, with enemies running around, and while there's big enemies you can't fight (yet?) overall you're running around dull hallways, shooting dull enemies, running in parks, in drab environments, shooting dull enemies, the game never really evolves beyond the dull lack luster experience that it starts with.  Who knows, the fourth level might be the best level in video games ever, but I couldn't stay interested long enough to e even reach it. And I have a feeling you'd be shooting the same drab enemies over and over.",0
"Competent, yet completely average and uninspired shooter. Ultimately, Timeshift feels just gimmicky - and it exhausts it's bag of tricks very fast. I had fun shooting an explosive bolt into a guy's head with time frozen and watching him suddenly become inert gibs. A couple of the weapon are very interesting, regardless - a submachine gun with incendiary rounds and attached flamethrower was different enough to become a favorite -, but their designs are, again, uninspired (What the hell is that assault rifle?!), and the audio and feedback lacks any punch (though the shotgun WILL send people flying... after maybe two or three shots at close range.) The game quickly devolved into slow-motion dashing through cover while waiting for the limited time-resource to recharge. In the end, Timeshift didn't offer enough freedom to abuse my timepowers nor enough challenge or solid gameplay to constitute a good shooter - in this regard, it didn't achieve either a sandbox I could blow steam off in nor a challenging game I could be engaged in. Instead, it forced me to play it like a shooter with a fun-but-repetitive gimmick I could enjoy every forty seconds - and it doesn't have enough foundation as a shooter to force me into that. F.E.A.R. provides a far more enjoyable experience - in which the time effect, while not as varied - supports a much better game - and one that stands on its own without the gimmick.",0
"Bland world doesn't develop as you progress, same assets are used everywhere. Story after the introductory CGI only gets worse and worse. The final battle is just meh.  After almost 10 years still has game breaking bugs. At certain point it's impossible to progress if the barrels are destroyed by scripted event, the grate is not thrown away by explosion and you have to explode the barrels yourself for it unlock the path what's a bit tricky to do. When solving some puzzles the ability timer is drained too fast and you have to constantly retry it until it goes slower for no apparent reason. At certain point it's almost impossible to perform a jump you have to mash whitespace like crazy for it work. I've had to use online walkthrough to find workarounds for that nonsense.  15€ for this? No, i can't recommend it, it's a bad game, even by 2007 standarts.",0
"Played the beta of this one, was hyped and cool. Recently bought the full game, spent 2 days on it, we-e-e-ell... No. No is a perfect word.  Time powers? No. Game adjusts timers and cooldowns as creators had planned ahead of you. 'Okay, man, scripted parts are okay, but otherwise you can do what you want!' - again no, your 'mana' meter won't allow you to. It won't be time-travelling kung fu out there, but just spamming Time Stop once in 7 seconds to insta-regen health and continue dodging tons of bullets.  Cool fighting? No. Grab the most overpowered guns in game and hope nobody shpongles charged plasma in your backside.  Cool graphics? Oh well, 2.5 out of 5. Backgrounds and levels are nice and linear, NPC are ugly, and you never see yourself in game. Even hands.  Cool storyline? Err... well, they explained basically nothing. HInts don't tie up into solid story, and there wasn't a solid story to begin with. Even motives and build-up are missing.  Cool multiplayer? Go get Unreal Tournament and forget this, srsly.  Cool cinematics? Yes, 5 seconds each. But hey! - we'll get a nude female once in a while there! Worth it!  My verdict - complete waste of time on our side and questionable waste of money and resources on developer's side. gg 2 ez.",0

"If you're going to buy this game, buy the retail version as it is at version 1.2. The Steam Store page for this game doesn't mention that the game hasn't been updated which means you won't be able to make any changes to the video settings if you do manage to launch it succesfully.",0

"First of all, my beefs with this game.  -Very short story. -Time powers drain ridiculously fast. -Practically no character interaction or any real explanation as to what's taken place to explain the events of this story. -Obvious setup for a sequel which will never happen. -Unfair mind reading AI which necessitates the need for the time bending powers. If you think good aim or reflexes will get you far, think again. -Another deaf mute protagonist. -No running -Unnecessary kill cam for no reason. -Overall poor execution of what could've been a memorable  Having said that, heres the little that I did like about the game.  -Good graphics for it's time. -Decent textures -4k support -Decent gun mechanics -Very original time combat mechanic and for solving puzzles. -Difficult and challenging.  I feel that for everything this game was trying to do right it, it poorly executed it while tacking on more annoying things than enjoyable. Overall, not worth the $4.99 I paid.  ",0
Game Crashes before title screen on 64-bit Win10 machine. Not the only one having this problem.,0
"If you want a mechanical experience that won't disappoint, but won't thrill, grab Timeshift.  Everything about this game is kind of over sold and under delivered. All of the alternate future weaponry looks cool, but none of it has any weight. The storyline is, to be perfectly blunt, as basic as you can get. A faceless, voiceless protagonist, who follows the orders of a ragtag resistance movement helps them obtain victory during certain engagements leading up to an assault on a walking tower ... fortress thing? This is a game that tries to tell you it's a lot grander in scope than it actually is. The plot has enough holes (not only thanks to time travel, but weird, inconsistant writing) to make the stoy not worth actually listening to, and the levels are rail straight, there's no exploration and very minimal interaction outside of 'Slow time down to bypass this air vent,' ....   In fact, if I look back on the environmental interactivity, I'd be hard pressed to list more than 5 different things you really need time manipulation for, and some of those don't make any sense narratively anyways!   Slow Time: Killing Enemies without getting torn to shreds yourself. This is a must. Cover is barely available and your shields are only able to take one or two shots, while enemies can take half a clip or more to kill, and usually come in waves of 6+.   Slow Time: Avoid Environmental hazard A,B,C etc (Ruptured gas lines on fire, electrified pools)  Slow / Stop Time: Avoide Mechanical Hazard A,B,C etc (Fan blades in a vent, Giant Fan Blade over Chasm, Instant kill Cutting laser security beams, more fans)   Reverse Time: Engadge mechanical system which would let you pass through it into the next section, but only if it were going backwards. Open doors, previously opened by something moving through it so you can pass into the next area. Rinse, repeat.   Here's the thing about time manipulation. If you're going to give a player the ability to slow, stop and rewind time by a Phlebotinum powered onesy, for god's sake give them more than 3 seconds of the power in the middle of their firefights. The amount of suit energy any one power would drain was completely different at different times. They don't even try to explain it. Quote Wikipedia:   The key feature of TimeShift is the player's ability to control time: slowing, stopping or even rewinding time more or less at will. This allows a player to stop time to dodge an incoming projectile or steal an enemy's weapon. Specific time-related puzzles also require these abilities. In some parts of the game the time powers are lengthened.  In some parts, the powers are lengthened. Sweet. Caramel. Zombie. Buckshot.   You can literally walk into an area and be killed within a second by enemies who target you. Using the Slow Time power outside of any pre-approved 'tactical recommendations' from the Timesuit's AI results in your suit power being guzzled faster than you can say 'Out of power, on open ground being shot at by ten enemy characters.'   However, in EXTREMELY similar situations, or in situations where there IS no enemy presence, time slow, time stop and even time reverse powers seem to be magically more power efficient. And let's be clear. We're not talking about a local time shift. We're not talking about alternate universe jumps. This is literally a game where they promise to give you the power to bend time as you want, then tell you for no good reason you can't do it for more than a few seconds, when ten minutes ago, you were making it fifteen minutes ago with enough power left over to charge your fitbit.  Zero crunchy combat, promised time manipulation powers that are as railroading as the envrionments, disappointing, prosaic story. It delivers on the action/shooter front and that is it. If it's on sale, and you want an FPS you can tuck away after 7 hours and never think of again, get it. Otherwise, avoid.  Cheers.",0
"Don't buy it for it's time-manipulation bs - the meter that it lets you control time with is so small a frame that you basically need accelerated senses anyway to slow down time...If your expecting a modern take on Prince of Persia - you DON'T want this.  Also the AI feels a bit scripted instead of natural - case in point: you try to destroy this big yellow mech with allies, the mech heals when you don't shoot it and the allies backing you continuely return to fire and make the same death scene whether you reverse time or not. Basically unless you can 1hit it with inferior weapons and/or make use of the limited time-manipulation reserves you have (something I wasn't able to do) you can't destroy it - however by backing up for cover you also reset the scene so you have to do all this without running back for shelter from it's rockets.  Finally Contrary to popular belief in time-manipulation crowds - you cannnot 'undo' a gameover in this game by reversing time.",0
"Did not live up to the 2007 Xbox Demo Hype i remembered. Poorly ported to the PC, its controls are clunky and infuriating. The game seems to think exploding a vehicle right next to you without warning multiple times is a good game mechanic. And when it does tell you and you stay away from it, only when you HAVE to walk past it, regardless of any time effects you use (eg FREEZING TIME), it will still explode and kill you.  ♥♥♥♥ing disappointed i had to rage quit this game, and i dont do that often.",0
"Where to even begin. This game is a narrative trainwreck, which sucks because a lot of it has so much potential that you can see rotting on the vine.  First off, this game doesn't handle multiple monitors very well. I've had to turn off my side 2 through nVidia control panel to make it play nice. Every time the game starts up, it opens a little pop up saying I've got incompatible drivers and sends me to nvidia's homepage to download the latest drivers which I already have. Older game, hard to program forward compatibility, but whatever, I can deal with that. Not impressed, but not enough to kill it either.  Gameplay: This is a generic linear corridor shooter with a gimmick of limited time control. You can slow time down, stop time and reverse time. And that's about it. It's not even as much fun as it sounds. What would have been more interesting is an open level approach with multiple solutions, instead of forcing the player down a single path and having the only option to be to shoot everyone. The time control features are introduced within 5 minutes of the opening level, and other than some weapons, that’s about it. The weapons themselves tend to flip flop between underpowered pea-shooter and BFG9000. There’s no character customization, only about 6 weapons total, a few have some alt-fire which is easily ignored and forgotten. A better way of doing this would be a leveling system that lets the player choose how they want to accomplish their objectives: perhaps some would like to do things stealthy, others like the time manipulation tools, still others prefer to load up on heavy armor, big guns, and shoot friends and foes alike until there’s nothing left but smoking ash. Some variety.   The AI is forgettable. They mostly just stand there, or get into poor cover while shouting about what kind of gun you have, request reinforcements, or repeat the same few canned lines again and again and again. They make up for their stupidity in sheer numbers and by killing you in a few shots.  Story wise, don’t even bother. You’re dropping into an alternate timeline around 1939, but might as well be 2100 with all the future tech running around. There’s the generic evil empire vs the good rebels, but I constantly found myself asking “Who are these people and why should I care about any of this.” You see some of the present in flashbacks, but don’t expect it to answer any questions. It might have raised a few questions, but by then I didn’t even care.   Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Deus Ex or Dishonored instead.",0

The time-based abilities make for quite repetitive battles when you just slow time down, rush out, shoot a few enemies, then rush back to cover and wait for the suit to regenerate energy.

"It's fun like a half-life 2 knockoff that uses stop, slow, and reversal of time as a strategy. The two things about this game that I wish the game had is the ability to peak around corners with 'Q' and 'E' or some other combination just like in the stalker games with the ability to prone AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HAVE A 1.3 STEAM PATCH SO THE GAME RUNS FLUENTLY AND DOES NOT HAVE CRASHES AND SAVE GAME CORRUPTIONS!

"Even at some early points, surprisingly hard and frustrating. The opponents are close to invisible and invincible.

"This is horrible. I normally finish my games, but this is just the worst. Leaving the storyless narrative aside, the gameplay itself is very lackluster. There's no way to turn off mouse acceleration. The weapons are super generic, and worst yet, you feel like a you're wearing a crappy aluminum can instead of some high-tech body armor.   If you're expecting something like Crysis Power Suit + F.E.A.R. time manipulation, you'll be disappointed. Not only are you super fragile (die from a few bullets), your timeshifting abilities can only slow down time for a few seconds, or pause it for even less time. This is just the worst.  I normally finish games, but this is unbearably a waste of time.  Rating: 0/10.",0
"Very disappoint after seeing all the praise the game gets for being underrated. Pitiful story, worse gunplay, and gimmicky timeshift mechanics.  First of all, there is no sprint, which wouldn't be a problem but the main character casually walks in the most life threatening situations. You can often die trying to walk to cover when your time powers run out. It tried to make you think about where you should be as you run out of powers but it's more like putting anvils on your shoes and calling it a design choice.  The time powers were also a very big disappoint. Neat concepts but the execution was very poor. The time rewind and time stop use so much power it seems they were only put in to solve the extremely simple time 'puzzles'; such as walking over the millions of electrified puddles. Time slow is about 90% of power usage as it's the only power that gives you any real chance in combat vs more than one soldier.  Now the gunplay isn't the worse I've seen in a game, but the way enemies can soak up about half of a magazine til death makes even the best FPSer turn into a camper while his OP slow time power comes back. I was never a fan of the bullet sponge enemies because it makes combat more gimmicky and campy. Even if you are quicker than the enemy it doesn't matter when you have to go through half a mag to kill one enemy while 2 others are shooting. Combat tends to be either slaughter everyone while in time slow mode then camp to wait for power to come back, or spam grenades for one hit kills then pick up more from their bodies. The only time combat felt somewhat fair outside of time slow was either the ballistic crossbow or sniping headshots, and even then enemies all had pinpoint accuracy from a mile away; and mouse sensitivity is iffy and ignores small movements when zoomed in too far in scope.  The game also doesn't understand what pacing or transitions are. The weapons go from the weakest assault rifle ever made, to the most overpowered weapons. The game goes from frustrating to super easy mode with the one shot crossbow, or infinite ammo boxes with a sniper or rocket launcher next to them. It still ends up being time slow then murder everyone; it just gets easier being able to one shot everyone before they murder you with pinpoint accuracy from a mile away when your time slow runs our and you are out of cover.   I mean, for an old game it isn't as bad as what I've seen, but it definitely doesn't deserve all the praise when it really is just semi-unique and but a very gimmicky one trick pony",0
Maybe it was a good game about 10 years ago. Not so special today. Run and shoot game with some special abilities. Hardly any story.,0

Under-rated for a reason!,0
"Not enjoyable. It takes around two mags to kill someone. Two hours into the game I started wondering if any of my abilities would get better (damage increase, better guns, time altering length extensions, armor). When slowing, stopping and rewinding time, it feels like the meter bar, for the amount of altering time you have left, drains way too fast to the point of why is this feature even in the game. Every time I went to a box that has the blue lasers covering the weapon in it, I thought I would get a better gun, but it would always just be more ammo. You'll have to worry about ammo either, it's everywhere. I didn't even know why I was fighting in the story, (Might just be my own problem) they just didn't make it interesting enough to want to know what's going on.",0
"Very average shooter, but with some interesting mechanics. Sadly the time-shifting abilities are only used to solve puzzles or as a 'bullet time' to pick off enemies, I really hoped they would have designed the game better around them. Taking them away leaves you with a bland shooter, nothing to write home about and a completely forgettable storyline, plus boring environments and level design. Not recommended, I'd give it maybe a 6/10 cause I still somewhat had fun and the weapons are quite cool. Nice gore effects also.",0

However, enemies soak up a half-dozen shots to the chest before dying, so you don't feel powerful either. Killing them doesn't feel like victory, it feels like a chore. The time powers are uninspired and not particularly useful.  And it's ripping off Half-Life 2 in a way that just feels pathetic. You fight battle-robots alongside The Rebels in a bombed out European city while the Evil Scientist President harangues you from a giant tv screen. You even run down a canal while baddies shoot at you from up on the walls!  Don't waste your time on this.  ",0
"Abominably bad, one of my biggest gaming disppointments. Do not buy.  EDIT: Finally struggled through to the endgame. A few thoughts:   - Story blatantly rips off Half Life 2, while somehow missing the pacing and depth that were the worthy parts to steal.  - Gameplay can flow nicely, but quickly becomes repetitive.  - Terrible level design.  - Graphics make Deus Ex's look modern.  - Pathetic AI.  - All the characters are 1-dimensional.  There is no challenge in this game. The time control mechanics make regular combat insultingly easy, even against the enhanced enemies. By the end I was just breezing through the fights. Ideally the story would have compensated for the boredom, but no luck there. The endgame was a cutscene, no payoff, no interaction. Just headshot, ♥♥♥♥ity bye. Overall, a wasted opportunity.",0
cant even run for 5 mins without crashing its time they made a remake of this title that works on todays pc's instead of remaking remakes of games that arnt even 5 years old spend some time in the real clasics in stead  ,0
"interesting story, but mediocre gameplay",0
" Edit: I finished the game, to check if that review was made too hastly. It is not; I stand by my point: this game sucks, and I am pretty sure that the reason why bad reviews are systematically poorly noted is that there are people who's interest is to sel... erm, downvote bad reviews of that game. DO NOT BUY. IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME.   I expect this review to be poorly noted (around 0%, maybe a bit more if I'm lucky to be read by someone honest), just like ANY other bad review on this game (I won't write here what are my takes on 'why', I let the reader figure out by himself why ALL the bad reviews on this game are poorly noted, whatever they may contain).  This game is not a pretty game. It's from 2007 but looks like it was from the early 2000 (LOTS of bump mapping, low-def textures, bad animations, very low poly models, etc. - I'm, of course, running the game on 'best' settings for everything; and honestly, as pointed out by one of my contacts, it's not due to the engine, which is pretty solid for the epoch, but rather to the lack of artistical direction, and very poor graphical choices). This game isn't a fun game either: the gameplay is utterly repetitive, the immersion is inexistent, there is no challenge either, and the time-based mechanics are interesting for a few minutes at best.  The player is left without any instruction, without any guidance on how to use the controls, without any background story, without anything that can help immerison, or interest: to imagine what playing this game is, just imagine downloading a random indie FPS with funny, unusual controls, with a random map, and stupid A.I., and you'll get close to what that game is.  I haven't played enough to give more insight about that crap, but I surely regret having spent 5 bucks into that. There are PLENTY of better games to buy, from Singularity (that also features some time-control mechanics) to Hard Reboot, and so on. Don't waste your time (especially) or money on that one, not worth it by any extent.",0
"So far I honestly regrett having bought this game. It's just unnatural. Starts with the default key bindings which are far off from what the average FPS is using: Zooming in is done with 'e', a melee attack by clicking the mouse wheel, the powers use awkward keys. There is no sprint, you get slightly faster additionally when slowing down time, but energy recovery is far too slow. On 'Skilled', it takes up to three shots with a shotgun to the head if they enemy's wearing a helmet. I fire away an entire mag with the assault rifle to the body. Luckily you get a lot of ammo, however you still heavily depend on using your time shifting abilities. But as said, the energy recovers way too slowly for such a heavy use.  You don't get any information on who you are are what the ♥♥♥♥ even happened. You suddenly appear in 1939 of an alternative world where a high tech civil uprising takes place instead of WWII. It's just your standard, linear, straight-forward FPS with special abilities in which difficulty doesn't mean a more human-like AI, but rougher enemies with increased health and armor and more bullets for you to take. As always, you're the uber-soldier, although I had the impression that actually you're a ♥♥♥♥ing scientist... since when can I, as a scientist, remorselessly kill people and even fire a damn gun so precisely?!  'Soldier, WHO ARE you?' &lt;--- I DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING KNOW.",0
I wish I could TimeSHift to before owning this game.,0
"Game requires certain drivers, and the ones they tell you to download aren't availbable. I'm sad I bought this...",0

"Overrated. I expected much more from this game. No story, no collectables, no weapon upgrades. Just going from A to B and shooting. Time freeze is the only thing that makes this game different from any other mediocre FPS.",0

"Whilst this game had some fun moments I can't really recommend it unless you manage to get it on sale, like I did (3,75 euro).  Basically, Timeshift is a mixture of F.E.A.R. and Half-Life, yet completely lacking in atmosphere and devoid of any interesting characters.  The 'story', for want of a better word, is pathetic, and turns out to be merely a weak pretext for moving you along from one set of stuff that you have to blow the s##t out of to another.  The widely dispersed 10 second long cut scenes containg anonymous characters that you don't give a fù@k about are laughably bad.  Some of the puzzles would be fun ... if you didn't have to die 10 times in order to solve them, which for me is a total immersion breaker ... although perhaps the word 'immersion' is paying to high a compliment to this drivel.  Summary: Not worth it unless you're in desperate need of some mental chewing gum to get you through a rainy day.",0
"I really wanted to like this game however I cannot recommend for one simple reason, bad story. The gameplay is solid despite the dated graphics. Also it is a fun shooter. However the end is an extreme let down to me and overall the story is just terrible. I found I didn't care about any of the characters and no one felt real.  In all if you want a fun shooter but don't care about story this game is worth your time, but that is it. If you end up liking this game I highly recommend checking Singularity, its at least as fun and the story is surprising how good it is as well as the way it is told.",0
good game on AMD FX 8350K 8 CORE CPU with MSI RX 470 G - CARDS WORKS ON WINDOWS 10  its a great game but you won't work onlone on multplayer i say if you want to play this game get a ps3 or xbox 360.,0
"Mediocre shooter with porting and technological issues.  The gameplay idea and mechanic is pretty interesting; you control time; slow it down, stop it, or even reverse it. However, that does not make the game fun.  The presentation is pretty good at places, but the shooting is very generic, unprecise (big crosshair where shots seemed off of the central point), and unrewarding. Graphics are pretty mediocre. Levels are very linear, with the occasional wait for trigger or wait for NPC scene.  As for the technological side of things: The key bindings are totally off - a bad port from consoles. The game first launched on my smaller, second monitor. I had to fiddle with ini configuration files to increase resolution and make it automatically decide to use the other monitor (good luck if you have multiple monitors with the same resolution). Especially in the tutorial, I noticed *big* hung-ups when I entered new areas, even rooms, where it probably loaded some data. A bit later, you occasionally slow down, simply walking a lot slower, which probably hides the loadung unresponsiveness. Hung-ups are definitely not something you like to see on a powerful PC. When launching, it tells me my drivers are not supported, twice, and links me to a dead website.  All in all, I had no fun at all in the little I played (I did press through the tutorial to see if the game itself, with the time manipulation aspect was any fun, but it was not), and with the technological issues, I’m thinking about refunding the game - because I certainly won’t play it any more. Definitely no recommendation.",0
"This game, on boy do I have a love hate relationship with this game.  It was the first 7th gen FPS I've played, and it taught me alot about shooters thanks to its solid gameplay and great time control mechanic that really works, but aside its nostagic values. This is not a good game, its decent at best.    It has alot of problem; boring unclear story, generic shooting, awful vehicle control and one of the worst multiplayer mode I've ever played. Else than its time mechanic, this game offers very little to the table, even back in 2007.",0
"The graphics are okay and the hole designs are creative but the gameplay leaves something to be desired.   Carefully planning and crafting an approach to each hole followed by watching your perfectly executed shot drop delicately into the cup is the magic in mini-golf. This game lacks that appeal for several reasons. The controls are limited (you only control direction and power) as there is no ability to put backspin on the ball or angle the ball off of your club. The physics are cartoonish leading to frustrating moments where reality does not align with your plan. Additionally, certain objects and boundaries/walls within the holes themselves are not modeled very well and can never be trusted to bounce where one would expect (imagine running in an action-oriented game in a wide-open field then being halted by an invisible wall).  Edit: Realized this game was made in 2006. My expectations are lowered but the comments above are still applicable today.",0
This game didn't ever get updated.,0
"There's no online multiplayer, only local.",0
"This game was released in 2006.  At the time it might have been innovative. Today, not so much. It's entirely playable. Just not fun.",0
Played a round. Nothing I saw would make me want to play another. Sometimes it was fun just to whack a ball as hard as you could to see what the goofy physics would do.   Grade: F,0
valve please give us the ability to delete games from our steam account,0
"Removed after just 1 hour playing: with the ball I have ended in a 'no man land' where there is no way to exit (any kind of touch just gave 'out of bounds', whatever the intensity or the direction). Moreover, controls are awfully weird. This kind of bugs and the low quality user interface make the game impossible to be played. Just a waste of money and time. DON'T TAKE IT EVEN FOR FREE!",0
Too luck based. Many holes have a hole in one path that can give the lucky player that gets it a massive advantage if the other players fail to do the same even once. It's a shame because there is a lot to like about this game otherwise.,0
"I find this game is too unrealistic, I know that is the point, but it is more that you have to learn new physics on different courses. It is more frustrating then fun, for me at least. I do not recommend this game if you love minigolf, because it is too arcady.",0
"This is the 3rd entry from my Steam library, 3D Ultra Minigolf Adventures Deluxe from 2006. The opinions expressed in this video are completely biased and personal and in no way reflect an objective viewpoint.         YouTube™ Video:  3D Ultra Minigolf Adventures Deluxe ... Old Guy and his library&nbsp;",0
"I don't need to tell you much except that you should avoid this game at all costs. I got this game free, and it basiccally lost all value within 10 minutes.  Verdict: GET THE HELL AWAY. GO. RUN!",0
"One look at the title should be enough to evaluate the quality of this game. It's every bit as bargain bin as it sounds. It's a passable attempt at minigolf if you're looking for a game that looks and feels like it belongs on the playstation circa 1996. Sadly, for all its attempts to sound cool with its '3D' and its 'ultra' it's actually pretty boring and pretty tame. It's very dated now but even by the standards of 15 years ago it would have been below average at best. Don't waste your money.",0
"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.",0
"Rather than adopting the typical structured format for my review, I'll instead just explain why I can't recommend this game. First off, this game has consolitis. Hard. Maximum resolution is 1280x800, it can't be run in a window without 'unexpected results,' and it ended up crashing my computer while attempting to play it. Twice. I think I will end up getting it on console, but I just can't recommend it for Steam. Apparently Prototype 2 is a worse port, which completely blows my mind. Anyways, this port just isn't worth it. It's buggy, locked down to hell, and is actually more expensive than just getting it for the 360 or PS3 off of eBay.",0
"I want to like the game, but with the sound issues, and all the work arounds, and there never been a patch, I just can't honestly recomend the game on Steam.  Is fun, no doubt, and the story is pretty interesting. The mechanics are awesome, the skills are really cool to use, etc etc etc, but the sound, and only being able to play for about an hour at a time without having issues happen, or going in and deleting files to remove sound issues, whatever. Is just ... not really worth it.",0
"I'm mildly upset; I've owned a copy of this wonderful game on a console before, and it was just fine. Great, even, I've had a fantastic experience. It has pretty good gameplay, not much in the way of story, but enough fun to leave a nice impression on you.   The reason I'm leaving a negative review is because the PC port is horribly broken right off the bat. It's the sound. The god-awful sound. it feels like it's been revved up to x64 speed. Do yourself a favor and don't buy the port.",0
Great game. Terrible port. Don't waste your money.,0
"TL,DR: Great idea, terrible implementation.  There is nothing that disappoints me more than lost potential. When I heard about this game, I loved the premise. Be an evil god! Leaping through the city, unleasing your unspeakable power on the hapless citizens! And sometimes, that's what I got. Most times however, what I got was a buggy, lazy, difficult-to-control mess.  I have some ideas what happened here. 1) The open world's so big, and there's so many missions and events and kaka, the designers didn't put all the effort they should have into polishing and playtesting. I can't help but contrast this game against something like Portal, that's small but perfectly tuned. I didn't expect THAT from Prototype, but I would have happily swapped a few missions and events for more time taken working the bugs out of the others. 2) From what I've read of other people's complaints, this is a really lazy port. The fact alone that this started as a console game explains some of my frustration, as there are simply too many options mapped to too few keys, leading to frequent raging when I meant to do one thing and something else happened.  I did finish the game. I finished nearly all of the events. And I'm not just calling a game bad because I sucked at it. In events where I actually felt like I was fighting NPCs instead of gameplay and glitches, I did fine. I got gold in most events, some on the first try. My frustration wasn't from lack of skill, but from things like...  *There are kill missions where you are supposed to use a certain weapon or power. Half the challenge is keeping the game from defaulting to kicking and jumping attacks that won't count towards your score. *Sometimes no matter how much I selected the whipfist, I wouldn't transform into it. No other power had this problem (Until the final boss, where I kept getting locked into previous powers and being unable to change them for a minute or so). *I beat an event with four seconds clearly left on the clock and it said I'd failed it. *Watching my character destroy infected water towers, yet the game says they hatched before I did. *Game gives you incorrect advice on how to proceed with a helicopter mission: 'Hold TAB and flick mouse to select another detector' *I lost track of the number of times NPCs killed off a Web Of Intrigue target before I could get to them. I lost an event MULTIPLE TIMES because of this. *A Consume Event icon on my map; no event or marker in the area when I'm directly at the spot. Followed by a Consume Event marker floating in midair with no corresponding event. *I consume a target in an event, the game says the target died and doesn't count it. I was IN the animation of consuming it! *Accidentally hit escape during an event; this aborts the event instead of pausing the game. *Targeting is gambling. Most of the time my attacks would hit just fine, but sometimes the game would decide that I'd much rather punch a helicopter than the Hunter I targeted. *Sound was really low, even at the highest volume. *Was supposed to protect a tank. Control was taken away from me while the game played a cutscene. During this cutscene, hunters attacked the tank and crippled it. I had absolutely no way to stop them. *Boss battle against a Supreme Hunter. Suddenly 'Objective Completed' without me having done anything, leaving me feeling cheated of a good fight. *I had to kill 100 enemies for an event. At 99 kills, the game stopped producing NPCs so I lost the event. *Timed kill event located in an area with tons of low fences, preventing me from getting to enemies or enemies getting to me. *Frequently getting stuck inside tanks despite clicking 'E' tons of times. *Lost a Movement event twice because the game suddenly put me in my armor, which meant I dropped out of parkour and lost precious seconds trying to get the armor off.  And you know what? I could forgive all of that, but the final straw was how TWO CUTSCENES THAT OCCUR DURING MISSIONS WILL CRASH THE GAME, MEANING YOU WILL HAVE TO START THOSE MISSIONS ALL OVER AGAIN AFTER YOU RESTART. The cutscene plays; fade to black; game is completely frozen. And it wasn't just me: I saw many, many people on many different websites describing the crash in The Stolen Body and Men Like Gods. Supposedly it's a corrupted audio file. It's unforgivable that this hasn't been patched by now.  So yeah, there were moments of occasional triumph. I liked a lot of the powers, the whipfist especially. when the game worked, it actually did feel pretty damn great. But those moments were rare. This was a game where 'flow' should have happened way, WAY more than it ever did. I got this for five bucks during a Steam sale and feel ripped off.  Also, I'm gonna be hearing those bedamned military alarm sirens in my sleep for weeks.",0
That's not compatible with windows 10 please don't buy it,0
"In Prototype you play as a man named Alex fighting against a shadowy government entity that he’s very mad at for giving him godlike superpowers. I would try to explain the plot further, but I honestly can’t. The volume drops inexplicity to whispers in all of the game’s cutscenes - it’s as if the voice actors themselves are embarrassed at taking part in this travesty.  You’ll battle the government and the plague monsters infecting an island that looks as if someone attempted to draw Manhattan without ever having been there - or even Googled it to see what it looks like. Fortunately, you’ll have a lot of cool powers at your disposal to help you. Unfortunately, thanks to Prototype’s overly complicated control system, you won’t figure how out how to use half of them. It doesn’t help that, despite Alex’s ability to hijack a helicopter in midair and bodyslam a tank, he can’t properly block. This becomes a problem as the creators of this game think that the way to make Prototype’s later missions be more challenging is for them to simply throw thousands of enemies at your face. The longer the game goes the more frustrating it becomes.  Ultimately, Prototype can be a fun way to spend a few hours, but you’ll quickly question why you keep playing it.",0
"At launch you already needed third party fixes to make game playable, now few years later they still haven't fixed it, talk about lazy developers, so disrespectfull, you pay them money and don't even bother to fix the game even after so many years, don't buy without doing research on issues to make sure you can fix them on your own, if you cannot fix it on your own then don't bother at all.",0
"I used to play this so much on the Xbox back in the day. When I loaded it up on the PC, it sounded like Alvin and the Chimpumunks were having an orgy. For those who own a Windows 10 and want to buy this game, just don't.",0
"Take on the role of Alex Mercer, a man who has no recollection of what’s happened to him or why, or how he came to acquire the shape-shifting powers he now possesses. Find the people who’ve done that to you and make them pay. The game -action, adventure, open worldish- sounded fun and looked fun, and I was very hyped to play it. I was also very disappointed when I finally did. Controls, though a bit wonky, are not difficult. You can change your body “at will” to attack enemies and destroy things, and when I say “at will” I mean you only have so many things you can change into. I think the most fun aspect of the game is the fact that you can ‘consume’ random people and then turn into them, and run/jump your way around pretty freely.   I’d say the graphics are dated, but it’s an oldish game, so it gets a slight pass for that. What it doesn’t get a pass for, however, is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance. For a 2009 game that should run like a charm on my computer, it sure worked like crap even at the lowest settings, lagging worse than Assassin’s Creed III - and at least that one had a reason to lag (no “low” video settings, hey). I’m also not particularly fond of the reddish/orangeish filter they use on later cinematics and gameplay time, I find it bothersome to look at.   Your character is overpowered, which is not bad in itself if you like an easy game, but it does make things boring after a while as it’s all the same; to tell the truth, it reminded me a little of God Hand for some reason, only that one was actually fun to keep playing. With Prototype, I did the first few missions and was bored out of my mind - that along with the slightly eye-hurting graphics and slight, random spikes of lag made the game truly disappointing.  The gameplay is pretty repetitive otherwise. Fight a bunch of bad guys, have them call in tanks and an airstrike, be chased, shake them off, rinse and repeat with a moderate variety of enemies and mutants to fight against.   It’s not a completely unplayable game, mind you. If you’re extremely bored and want to play something that doesn’t pose a huge challenge, it’s not a bad game and could even be considered entertaining. I liked the city, the chance to explore it some, the general idea of the game was good (though the story was a bit hit and miss with me), but the execution left a lot to be desired.  Perhaps if the game had lagged a bit less I would have enjoyed it a bit better.  I wouldn’t recommend this game, but I would certainly not tell you to steer clear from it either, as I feel it could be a lot more fun if you can actually play it sans the lag.",0

"I honestly believe Radical Entertainment though up this game, went around to other developer studios learning what they did wrong and right in games in the past, took the 'right' pile, tossed it in the toilet and flushed it down, and started building the 'wrong' pile into some unholy altar.  Seriously. EVERY... SINGLE... THING... in this game is a TEXTBOOK example of 'what NOT to do in video games' that you'd get in a 101 class.  Terrible controls. Terrible plot. Terrible music- maybe. Sound was INSANELY LOW compared to everything else on my computer- even when maxed. I literally had to TRIPLE the volume of my speakers to be able to hear it at a decent level. Terrible graphics. Terrible controls. Oh wait- I said that already. Well it's important to re-emphasize because the controls and mechanics made the game BORDERLINE unplayable. And I use that world with the utmost intention. If it had a SINGLE thing worse with it's controls- it would have been straight up unplayable. The game until a certain point was so easy it was impossible to enjoy. Then after that point they cranked the meter up to 11 to the point it was entirely unfair. Permanent stunlocks. ONE HIT KOs that you CANNOT avoid.  NEVER. EVER. EEEEEVER... buy this game. EVER.  I got this game at 75% off on a sale. I feel like walking up to the developers studio and demanding that 25% I paid back as a refund, then the 75% I didn't added on to compensate for my pain and suffering. This game was THAT bad. I've only ever quit one other game in my entire LIFE- witcher 2. And that was because it was LITERALLY unplayable due to issues with the port to PC. At least I knew within the first 3 minutes of witcher 2 that it was going to be nothing but pain and suffering and I didn't actually suffer through the ENTIRE thing.  I played through the game start to finish (as quickly as humanly possible...) so no one can say I didn't give it a chance. It had it's chance 100 times over as far as I'm concerned. I am unfortunate enough to have bought prototype 2 at the same time as part of the franchise pack when the game was on sale. Needless to say- I will not be installing that any time soon.",0
"First thing first, I had absolutely lots of fun with this game. Just the sheer amount of destruction you are capable of doing is incredible. The hero has so grossly overpowered he literally rips to shreds everything he encounters, from regular people, through tanks and helicopter to disgusting and huge mutants. Action is satisfying and story, B-rated as it is, has a nice twist at the end. The reason I must say no, is that the game has some technical difficulties and it took me a few hours browsing through internet discussion and trying a lot of things to get it run normally on more than 3 FPS.",0

"Prototype is actually a really fun game, but its an example of one of the negatives of PC gaming that I've dealt with over the decades I've been nerding out... some games just stop working on modern hardware. This can be for a variety of reasons, and some people can fix the problems with a weird trick like disabling some obscure setting in your OS that you've never heard of... but for some people, myself included, the reasons are completely mysterious.  Prototype barely worked for me, and I eventually just sort of gave up on it. The common fixes posted online don't seem to work for me, so I'm kind of left in the dust.  If the game runs for you, you'll have a blast, but I can't recommend it based on how it performs. The developers also seem uninterested in fixing the issues as of April 2016.",0

Having played that game I've decided to give Prototype a shot.  The name couldn't be more apt. Unfortunately for me, having something to compare this game to has compromised a good chunk of my objectivity.  I like the open world aspect, and the visceral feeling of power that Alex has, but I could do without his one-note, 'I'm angry, with a gravely voice', presentation   I don't like that his only interactions with the npcs range from  NYC-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  to  homicidal sociopath .  The game performamce is a little laggy but otherwise problem free, (I am playing on a laptop with middling AMD graphics, as my gaming rig is in storage until get a new place) and it holds up pretty well at 720p The issue I have is with how long it take to switch to and from the... 'genetic memories'(?) Section.  I am not through with game but right it's grade is a c+  Addendum: I am finally at the end this... game and my enjoyment has dwindled as I have gone on... I am at what is I'm guessing is the final boss (after starting the game over on a new machine) and I am struggling to find any reason to continue. Poor AI and targeting has just gotten worse (or more noticeable) as the game went on.  Final grade of this game is a   D -  ",0
Isn't as good as the sequel. It's a much longer learning curve and not as fun (obviously it's older but that doesn't change my mind).,0
"This may be a good game in the original, but this port is horrible. The only way anyone could fully understand what's going if playing for the first time would be to turn on subtitles. Most things are fine but audio issues alone ruin this. Most of all, you Activision will be too lazy to go back and fix this 'small' issue. If you want to play this game, I suggest you find a console version instead. I once again must ephasize it's not the game that's bad, it's just this port of it.",0
"It is very boring.  There are some 'fireworks' in the game, but these days a game must be like a good movie to be atractive. There are so many other games with a good story in the background. Here you just walk, run or fly and destroy everything around you.  Waste of time... Really...",0

Seven years later, this gamebreaking error is not fixed, and has to be manually looked up and dealt with by players who want to play this. To people who want to play a singleplayer game for once because their internet is too ♥♥♥♥ to play online, this is just infuriating. So basically, i bet i would like this game, if i could play it. But due to this error, i wont be able to, and seeing as this is left unfixed for seven years now, there is no hope for me to play this game in the future either.",0

"Didn't age well, graphics are choppy as hell, even the cut scenes. And no my computer is not crap, its very good.",0
"I had high hopes, way back when I bought this. A superhero game with body horror? Awesome! But no, while running and gliding aroud was fun and growing giant claws and was even more fun, a dull story, entirely unsympathetic cipher of a protagonist and samey, dull, dull combat dragged it down.  That said, it was fun to absorb soldiers and take their appearance then point at someone else and watch people shoot them.",0
"Wow, this game is horrible, controls are crappy, graphics are hiedous amd sounds like an 80s game. Very dissapointed!",0
This game blows. Don't buy it.,0
"There's only a couple conditions under which you should buy this game: One being you are out of other games to play entirely, two you don't really care about story or content but enjoy rampaging, three it is on sale. Unless you have all three of those conditions, it's probably not worth your time or money. This game is a mashup of GTA and Infamous, but not nearly being as good as either. The story, voice acting, gameplay mechanics, and AI intelligence are all shoddy, so really you play this game through until you unlock all of your powers and then just rampage killing everyone for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles. Even then that can be boring because there's no variety in any enemies, situations, or scenery in the game. All in all, this is a game that you will want to play casually, and not something you're probably going to enjoy an overly large amount.",0
"This game is awesome, however, the game file is broken or just DERP for no reason. it has trouble opening, and sometimes doesnt but now it just crapped out while in game. i am really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at steam for selling me a $20 game, that i can barely play. i would not buy this product until its playable. i have a win 8, Asus with 16 G ram and a 630 Nvidia G-Force, and a dual quad proccessor. my computer is fine, ive redownloaded the game, deleted the cache, gone through troubleshooting and forums. even went through the firewall, anti-virus and even uninstalled steam, reinstalled, reinstalled the game and still i get a failed to find Exacutable file. WTF Steam.",0
"Not recommended. I keep getting fooled by EA games. It's a fun premise, with lots of other people giving it great reviews.  Some obvious short comings is resolution is capped at 720p, and cut scene audio isn't ported out correctly (you can change the latency in which audio comes in, which means unsynced audio/audio plays faster than the video in cut scenes). It's pretty bad, even for a 5 year old game - EA always does ports, and they've always turned out unpolished.   Maximum AA is 2x, and in all honesty, the graphics are horrendous for a 2009 game. This looks like it was based on the first generation half life engine.   All in all tho, the story has potential, as well as the game play (game play/controls/movement is not fluid), and the beginning tutorial is kind of useless as... you have to redo another tutorial anyways. The biggest appeal to me, is like all the other reviewers said - you are an over powered beast capable of rampaging through everywhere. The terrible port of cutscenes detracts from the otherwise good story line, and the controls are pretty bad (eg: i'm standing over a gun, I press the 'grab' button, and he lunges in the air hoping to grapple a non-existent target instead of the gun he's standing on top of. Problem is, his lunge moves him forward, meaning i have to reposition him per failed grab. Ugh)  I don't recommend this EA port of a game, at all. Frustrating, perhaps console version is better",0

"An interesting freeroam game, with a good idea and interesting story. Those who like free roam games will like it. Overall it's good. But the story is full of clichés, the combat system is too console like, and resembles the Force Unleashed (I just beat before this game). The same targeting, health gain system and even you have unlockables, and upgrades (not really combos). The NPC characters start to look the same after a while. I was somwhere in the middle of the story or at the first third, when I totally lost my interest. Nor the story, neither the game style couldn't get me back to the game.",0

I Mean who doesn't enjoy dropkicking helicopters to death in a 'free roam' environment. between a massive slew of unlockable powers and movement mechanics, some really stylish animation, and overall addictive gameplay- this game has a lot going for it. However, between a thin story (It could've been a lot better if there was just more character depth) and some maddeningly bad boss fights *cough* elizabeth green *cough* and the abysmel slew of bugs that invariably result in stunlocks and instant death- the latter parts of the game will probably leave you feeling like you should go play contra to unwind. for a game released in 2009 to have so many weird bugs is. well... not so great. Especially from a publishler like activision. Still the bugs arn't so bad as to completely ruin the game. All in all i'd give it a 6 out of 10. The animators did great, the graphics, for the time, are OK. (Would be better if not clearly aimed at consoles) the story and gameplay itself could be a little more solid.

"This game is a prime example of what happens when people that think game consoles were a good idea try to develop video games. Apart from the usual UI horrors (lengthy, yet unskippable 'presented by' sequence at every start, 'do not turn off power while the game is saving' notice at every start, extremely inaccurate mouse tracking, etc.), the aspect ratio is messed up (huge black borders; I've seen others complain about this on the forums, so it seems it isn't just me), the controls are clearly geared towards  (gag)  gamepads and the list goes on with all the classic nonsense that happens when a game is developed for consoles and then back-ported to PC.  What really tipped the balance is the fact that the performance is completely ruined by what, judging from what I read on the forums, is likely some severe issue with detecting the controls. After having spent days getting Final Fantasy XIII (which exhibits a similar issue) to run halfway decently, I frankly can't be  &lt;kinsoku jikou&gt; ed to find a series of hacks just to circumvent this ridiculous performance hit. Even on a state-of-the-art PC that runs all other (properly developed!) games smoothly on high quality settings, this game can only be described as 'unplayable' on PC. While there might or might not be ways to fix this up (apparently involving downloading hacked versions of game DLLs from shady one click hoster sites --  DO NOT DO THIS , you'll be inviting viruses, trojans and whatnot onto your system!), it can only be said that the average Joe (as in, somebody that isn't a computer expert) would have little chance to get this game to work properly (without blindly following quite dangerous instructions off the internet, anyway, cf. the bit about the modified DLLs).  On a more technical note, apparently there is a cap on the amount of video memory and exceeding this cap restricts the quality settings severly. The very fact that this cap is 2 GB rather than 4 GB (i.e. the so-called engine uses a signed integer to represent memory size) is quite indicative of whoever wrote this game not knowing anywhere near enough about programming to even think about making video games. I'm sorry, and this is not supposed to be flame bait, nor an insult, nor to be taken personally, but the preceding is simply a fact.   Bottom line : Unplayable on PC; cannot, in good conscience, recommend.",0
"The Unreal Engine 3 is pretty standard fare but it's definitely not been fully utilized. Will add more later. It's worse than Prototype 2 but that's a given. At least some parts are more realistic. E.g. The viral detectors are far more sensitive in this version.  PROS 1. Good story I like how it goes. I'm quite curious as to how the story ends.  CONS 1. Movements are clunky a. You can only run upwards on the walls, not sideways b. If you run upwards into the rafters, you flip backwards  2. AI is dumb If you land from a 50-storey building in a black ops disguise, no one seems to be suspicious.  3. Combat is horrendous You can't fix onto a single target enemy and you swing all over the place. Swinging would be good if your reach was far enough but it's so pathetic. You tend to punch instead of using your claws as well.  4. Combat is lame Collecting genetic materials was so lame. You are basically running around a zone collecting shiny bubbles. You are a living weapon not a bubble collector.  5. Flashbacks It's basically cheap voice acting. The images are re-used over and over again.",0

Defective as hell",0
"This game is possibly the biggest influence for Saints Row 4, however, I'd say it's not anywhere near as good. The story is hard to follow (might be because the voice acting is terrible, could also be because the story is kinda really very boring).  For a 2009 game, the visuals are really horrible. Lighting and shadows seemed a little closer to 2006 levels (I was playing with everything maxed out)  The controls were alright, though it wasn't anywhere near refined enough so the game felt cluggy from time to time.  The game most likely requires some work to get running well. With Nvidia cards, it's less of an issue, but almost everyone seems to suffer frame rate issues of some sort. If you are running with the an Nvidia card, I'd suggest leaving Vsync off in game and use the control panel (This should really be standard practise).",0
It works for the first few minutes but it crashes afterwards. It was a good game. It's a shame that it does that. I wouldn't recommend buying this game at all. It'll be a waste of your time and money.,0
A giant heap of terrible console port. With a i7 6700k and a gtx 1070 I manage 20 fps. Sound has awful clipping and desync. Got the franchise pack on sale and I would write a review for the second but it doesn't even launch. 0/10 wish I could get my 7 dollars back.,0
this game's port is a joke Can't run the game on lowest settings even with the required specs  really if you port something take your time on it,0
The audio in the cutscenes is choppy consistently and the framerate is extremely low in gameplay. Sucks the fun out of a great game.,0
"Hell no.  Only thing better than the second game on here is the story, and Alex as the character. Which you can get in the second game, so really only the story is better here. The combat is ♥♥♥♥.  Why target any of the 30 enemies infront of me, when you can target a broken, unthreatening tank behind them?  Why grab the enemy infront of me when you can turn to the left and grab a giant rock or car?  The absorbing is so ♥♥♥♥ing slow. Second game, you grab a dude, jump, slam him down and instantly absorb him. Here, he has to do some long fancy move first which is EASY stopped if you are even tapped.  Their idea of challenge is put you in a small location where YOU are the target of everything. First you fight humans, who half have grenade and rocket launchers that bounce you everywhere when you are trying to fight. Then are blessed by large monsters that are fast as hell and can easily throw you around too.  Which they find then a equal hate for just you, and you then have 40 enemies to then deal with.  Bravo! :D I honestly see 0 playing value in it. Even for 1 more second of my time. It is among 1 of the worst experiences with a game I had to deal with.  I am just sad I can't still get a refund and buy something worth the money.  I played games with bad stories but the gameplay kept me coming back. But this has a ok story with god awful gameplay. It can be fun, until you keep getting long repetitive missions over and over. Here are 90% the missions: *Destroy 10 of these acrossed the map.  *Guard this for 20 minutes.  With the every so often: *Kill this guy  game is like a 4/10 for me. I envy the people who couldn't get it to run for them. They atleast could get a refund.",0
"I booted up the game and watched the 'intro' that you get after idling for a brief bit at the start-up screen, and to my dismay, the sound was completely insanely broken. 'Maybe it's better in the game', I guessed to myself, and proceeded to fiddle with the options, as one ALWAYS does after buying a new game.  But lo and behold, I then noticed that the highest resolution option available is a measly 1280x800. I wasn't aware of the fact that this game was made in göddämn 2002. 'Fine', I thought, and went with it. I fixed the controls (the ones necessary, anyway, since I'm using a 360 controller for it), and exited the options.  I tried starting a new game (oops, spoiled it there, didn't I?) with the key word in that sentence being TRIED. Yeah. I can't even start the game proper without it crashing. Three failed tries and a cursory google search later, I've come to the conclusion that this is not a game that was designed for even REMOTELY modern computers.  TL;DR: THIS GAME IS NON-FUNCTIONING. AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS. 0/10",0
"I tried playing again recently and I realized within the first 2 hours why I never bothered to complete this game. Considering that the game is no longer supported and also doesn't work well on Windows 10 with newer graphics cards, I can only recommend that people give this game a pass.",0
good game. i first played this game on my xbox 360. when i first bought it i was disapionted with the game. but i figured i would give it another try. no thumbs up or down... it would cool if there was a way to play it in full hd. but no only 720 for this one guys... save your money,0
This game is a terrible PC port. I tried to start playing this again but it crashes upon trying to load my old save and crashes upon trying to start a new game. I love the actual game but if they can't even make it playable then it is trash.,0

This is a good game on ps3 so I figured id buy it again for pc... this game sucks on pc its buggy the resolution makes everything widescreen the keys are laggy and sometimes unresponsive (usually during important times or right after a pause) story wise its a good game &amp; theres more cutscenes in the pc version but overall I can't recommend it.,0
"as much as i love this game, i can't recommend this game to any pc gamers. its a port for as far as i can see. i had a few problems running it and optimalizing it. turst me, the game is awesome, but get it for a console. i'd tell you more about the game, but if you dont know it by now, you're not really intrested in this kinda game. probly.",0
You're more likely to get this game running on a toaster than a PC.,0
The world is pretty large and varied and the powers are fun as hell. But the combat in the game is just abysmal and you will spend 90% of all boss fights and large encounters stun locked. About the worst thing you can do to a player is not let him do anything in combat except be ragdolled around because literally every enemy down to the smallest soldier has a gigiantic aoe attack that stuns you. Hope you like getting chained down 100 to 0 over and over again. Unless you like running in hitting one punch and then jumping away to heal 70% of your health for 1 minute so you can jump in and punch once again. Just painful and slow. It may have fine in 09 when this came out on console but it has not aged well.   Story is good at least.,0
"I haven't even gotten into the game yet.   But there is this incredibly stupid glitch. That the dev's haven't even bothered to attempt to fix. The games resolution will be stuck at a max of 1280x800. In order to get around this, you have to do a ton of messing around with files (potentially downloading a .dll file to replace theirs, so that you can get a full 1080p resolution.) There are some simpler solutions, that have worked for some people. (Lucky them.) They haven't worked for me yet. I haven't even succesfully gotten the game to work yet. I shouldn't have to spend this amount of time to get it to work though. Especially when I paid for the game.   This will stay a 'NOT RECCOMENDED' review, until someone fixes this bug. Which I HIGHLY DOUBT will happen, since this game is flat out too old to be worth their time to fix it. It's a bummer this bug is here. Because it is preventing people from enjoying this game.  EDIT: I fixed the resolution issue... but the .dll modification I had to make, doesn't allow for any AA. Which is total bullcrap in my opinion. 1920x1080 is an incredibly common resolution. The game dev's should have made this game fully functional with it, before release.",0
"Bought this during the recent sale (May 2015), and definitely cannot reccomend. Game has been abandoned by the developers, had horrible crackling audio (fixed via lowering sound card freq settings to ancient standards), and it won't run above 720p (at horrible frame rates even so).  I'm just so tired of buying an older game on Steam just to find it's broken and I've wasted my money. Vote with your wallets, and avoid this one.",0

"Bad port, buggy, terrible AI, cant target accurately, repetitive gameplay  despite your character being overly powerful its hard to realise is true potential with such a mess  1/10",0
"I should have listened to all the bad reviews for this game and not bought it, but not for the reasons I thought...  when I started the game it was stuck at 1080 x 800 p or something like that. which means I could not get it to go fully full screen no matter how hard I tried.  I was ok with this though. to me the gameplay was worth it, enough to bypass this.  then I found out how the music just wouldn't play much outside missions menu's and combat. again I was ok with this.  I was even ok with the fact that most of the voices did not work forcing me to read subtitles.   I imagined everyones voices pretty well in my head.  but then came the thing I was not ok with. I call it the stupidly complicated frustrating mission of ultimate bullsh*t!!  it starts of with you entering a science base. I totally messed up at the stealth but got in anyway. I thought the game was quite forgiving, and I was so so wrong...  right after getting in and watching a cutscene I am told to lead these big tanky infested zombie things to a military base. and they one of THE most rage inducing stupid enemy designs ever!  they can run faster then you, chuck stuff at you with perfect aim and worst of all their close combat attacks track you. its like they have hacked aimbot into their fists!!  sure you can doge them if you run around like a mad man like i did, but to really hurt them you need to hit them with close combat combos, and when you do they just go 'NOPE F*CK YOU!!' and interrupt it with an attack that is faster than yours.  then they stunlock you until you are nearly dead. so the game ever so helpfully recommends that you kill them for more health. you could always try to kill other things for more health like enemy soldiers but they like to focus on you and only you.  so when you do try that they beat the sh*t out of you until have have as little health as you started with.   but the mission... oh the mission you fight them on is so much worse...  first 3 of them come in and you have to kill them all, then 8 more after that and 10 more after that!  all the while alex mecer (main guy of the story. the one you play as) is saying stuff like 'bring more! ill kill them all!' and 'i could take on a 100 more!' NO YOU CANOT YOU STUPID LITTLE BABY! NOW SHUT UP!!  so then after running around in circles like a mad man while the miltary shoots them like I did, or you somehow mange to kill them by yourself (in that case I am in awe of you!) you are told to blow up a bunch of fuel tanks to kill the stunlockers of doom, by using the rocket launchers and granade launchers that are impossible to aim, while somehow not getting stonlocked to death.  once you do that it triggers a cutscene were the zombie monsters are killed by the explosions.   only moments before they were face tanking 12 rockets at once!! so the fuel tanks explode the monsters die, and alex mercer stands right there as the ENTIRE BUILDING FALLS ON HIM!! without taking a scratch when ingame rockets do hurt him!!  the players reward for all that? a smug c*cky grin from alex mercer and bullets in your face as more soldiers shoot you right afterwoods.  just die already you stupid game and stupid baby face alex mecer!   3/10 already anyoing issues, game crashes for some,it won't even start for others and controller breaking frustration.",0
This game is completely broken on PC. You are only able to start new games. If you try to load a game it crashes. There are some workarounds but who wants to jump through hoops everytime you want to continue your game. I went out and bought it for 360 instead.,0
"This game used to be one of my favorite city sandbox action games, but it hasn't aged well and has performance issues on new OS/hardware combinations, and it's such a shame! What a great game abandoned by the publisher on PC.",0
"Fun game, crap port. Requires all sorts of fiddling just to bring the framerate up to a proper amount, feels like you're emulating it rather than playing it.  Again, fun game, but I can't reccommend the PC version as it runs like crap. 18FPS unless I go and disable all my HID Complient devices? You're kidding me right?",0
"This game is the definition of mediocre. It's like if you took the most frustrating moments you have in Saints Row 4 and made the entire game out of it.  The soundtrack is forgettable, the graphics are very bland (you'd think the blood and gore would be more vibrant), the gameplay is repetitive. A lot of the upgrades on your powers, and your powers in general, are useless when you either A. get a better power or B. find out that the best course of action in every scenario is to use the military weapons.  I think that's what ultimately killed this game for me: you have such a variety of moves and powers to use, but in the end it's best to keep it very simple and straightforward.  And one more thing: nobody in this game will ever SHUT UP. I was uninterested in the story as it was, but I had to go and mute the dialogue completely to stand the rest of this game. It would still make the master volume quieter when someone was supposed to talk, which was incredibly annoying too, but it also made me think to myself over and over 'Why would anyone be speaking right now?'",0
"Prototype Pros and Cons ------------------------- Pros- stealth and some creative ideas like patsy and consuming people to gain upgrades and fun to run up walls  Cons-Frame rate dips constantly to single digits from 20-30, story is confusing and badly told; to many powers moves give wired button layout. Collectable will not show up till you get close and no way to track them, city layout is boring and really poor dialogue; Alex in cut scene sounds like an everyman that got a short deal, but then goes and kills hundreds of people, gameplay-combat gets frustrating and traversal gets boring, auto lock-on is not helpful ",0
"super glitchy, and controls are laggy and poorly layed out",0
crashes right after the loading screen. This is a problem for a lot of people but worth it if you can get it to work,0
"Game is fun, but it's very poorly optimized.",0
"I didn't run into any of the porting bugs (resoluion, sound, graphic, et al) but the story and game plan on this are hard to suggest to anyone that values their time.",0
"Boring and repetitive gameplay. Twitchy camera that loves to jerky around, making it tough to track your targets. Weird sound bugs that cut in and out during the 'story' segments, which mean you can't understand what's being said; very annoying. I completed the game, so my total is about it for length, unless you want to do all the side missions, which are even more boring and repetitive then the main story; add a few more hours if you do. Combat is fun for a bit, but the game loves to spawn stuff in the moment your back is turned, literally, which kind of makes it pointless after you shred your 10th helicopter in a row. The only way to end it is to fly away, where they lose interest in 10 seconds, after you killed 100s of their men. Also, the combat take a dive towards the end when you fight the super solders; QRTs every time you fight these guys, and if you miss it, it will really hurt. On top of everything else coming at you (there is ALOT), these guys really ruin the flow of the combat, only way to beat them beyond shoot/throwing stuff at them is the QFT; pretty bad in a game where free flow combat is the main draw. Additionally, weapon balance is poor, why use anything else after you get the sword? Yea, unless you looking for absolutely mindless slaughter, and can tolerate the camera, you should probably pass.",0
"Playing Prototype was a red haze. The games protagonist Alex Mercer is an unrepentant sociopath and embodies the Prototype worldview. Mercers obsession with vengeance leads him into mass murder, which in turn makes it impossible to root for him. He actually uses civilians as 'medi kits', absorbing their bodies to replenish health. One of the primary quest givers is Mercers sister, and not killing her seems to be Mercers most humane act.   In fiction, the most obvious way to justify the anti-hero's acts is to make the villains even more evil in comparison. Prototype is not afraid of the obvious, and the military and the private sector seem to be psychopaths to the last man.   The gameplay is OK but unspectacular, with Mercer having access to various powers but gaining upgrades at a very fast speed indeed. The speed of Mercers movements is very fast too, and going from place to place is actually well made. The typical activities (obstacle courses, kill challenges etc.) do not fit the game, at all.   Prototype is nasty and nihilistic and I cannot recommend it to anyone. Prototype fans were somewhat disappointed when Mercer returned as the primary villain in 2, but that is what he was all along.",0
"I have to admit I have had a little fun with this game, but it's not that good overall. The combat is repetitive and boring.",0
Meh. Mediocre game that gets old after about 5 minutes. You're better off buying a cup of Americano.,0
I don't know what the big fuss is about; I do not like this game. I realized very quickly that this game is just a rehash of that old open-world Spiderman game. They just replaced Spiderman with Alex. Not to mention that I feel extremely overpowered and I am not that good at video games for the most part (50+ hours spend only on the first level of Demon Souls before I switched to PC). There's also the fact that the cut scene audio clips and cuts out constantly even when I turn down the settings. I bought Prototype and Prototype 2 and now I am out $20 because I am most likely not going to ever play them again.,0
crashes at startup no solution in site prototype 1&amp;2 Don't buy,0
"This game is probably good, but it does not work for me since it just crash in the loading screen when I try to start a game. I searched it up on google what to do and some people tells me to go to the BIOS to disable hyper threading, but im not a high-tech IT guy and this should not happen on a game. 5/10 because its probably a good game, but does not work",0
"The game doesnt work, it stops working everytime I start a new game, and closes it. Aditionaly, the game wont recognize any graphics card that has more than 1.5Gb of VRAM, and will limit your gameplay to 720p and no Anti-Aliasing. Two fixes were found so far for this last problem, but one wont work with steam version of the game, and the other involves changing a dll inside the game system folder, something like a crack. It worked for me in the menu, but the game is still crashing.  The fact is the game is broken, and there are no devs around anymore. If you want this, I sugest you search a little bit about its problems. And make sure the refund is available.  [EDIT] My specs: Win10 64bit 16GB ram 2x780ti SLI i7 4930K  [EDIT2] I just found a workaround for the crashing: Going into the computer BIOS and disabling the CPU's HyperThreading. I still dont recommend the game.",0
This Game is a time waster. a rip off of infamous second son. and its 30$?? dont buy.,0
"Wish I could play this game to give a better review, but the audio bugs and god awful lagging in the FIRST CINEMATIC prevented me from even wanting to get to the first mission. I looked up ways to fix it, and even the '100% FIXED!!!!!!11!!' solutions for it weren't 100%. You'll have to do a lot of disabling and shuffling around/deleting of files to fix the issues.  So in conclusion, this game isnt worth the full price, nor the On Sale price (I got it for $4.99).",0
This game doesn't work well with a keyboard and mouse. The game also gets boring after some time. The gameplay is too repeitive.,0
"Super-villian simulator, horribly optimized graphics. story most likely written by a teenage comic writer wannabe, but the movement and fighting were not that bad. Worth the bargin-bin price of a sale only.",0
"Could be an ok game if not for the controls that make your character feel like your driving a bus.  Helicoptors also have a tendency of dissappearing and appearing where ever they please. doesn't matter if you were going to attack them or not or if they are a few feet in front of you. Very unrewarding gameplay makes you just want to uninstall  -0/10 don't bother  also for some reason the recent news for Prototype is   This Prototype Legend of Zelda Cartridge Can Be Yours for a Mere $150,000",0
"Great Game until... the developers decided to do a mission ('Under the Knife') with infinite enemy respawn. Played 30min killing the entirely population twice... but the enemys keep respawing out of nowwhere and if you want to run away, dont even try, helicopters do unrealistic movements and keep on your butt, there is no escape, not on ground nor the sky. My brain hurts after this 30min killing everything in sight session. &lt;3",0
"Opening the game works but when you complete the 'start new game' and set your difficulty, the game just stop working. Every time I tried it it just crashed.  I am running Windows 10-64bit and the game does not work.",0
"this game gets boring very soon. take that as a personal assumption, it has interesting mechanics and what it seems a decent story but i found it being clumsy and repetitive.",0
Sucks ♥♥♥. Won't even ♥♥♥♥ING START,0
The resolution won't go beyond 1280x800 without downloading a third party mod. I refuse to have to download an untrustworthy program just to make my game not look like I'm playing it on a smartphone screen.,0
Hate having to give this a bad review since i played the hell out of it on console and enjoyed every minute. The pc port is simply broken with crashes on loading screens and less than acceptible resolution locks. My game won't even allow me to start a new game; it simply crashes. Still haven't found anyone who knows how to get around that. Its a great game ruined by a shoddy pc port. So sad when that happens.,0

I was able to get the game running and max out the graphics without issue. However the targeting system in the game and the camera angles are absolutely terrible. Since that's a huge part of the game it's largely unplayable.,0
"I can't really comment on it fairly. For me it doesn't work without going at about 15fps. Which is odd considering I can max out crisis 3 on ultra setting without a hint of slowdown. I've tried getting it to work but no joy. So it will be relegated to never seen again. Apart from that, I remember it being pretty good on the xbox 360. Time has not been kind and it hasn't been updated. Highest res is limited and as I side it was choppy choppy choppy. I cannot really recommend it, but remember it might just be down to my crapness with making software work. I am just one of those types that likes it to work without needing me to hunt through forums and get in touch with long lost relatives.",0
"Broken piece of crap. Sorry, can't put it any other way.",0
"Prototype is a really good open world PS2 game.   Yes, it was built for newer consoles, and on PC it should look even better, but for some reason it just feels like it's a Playstation 2 quality game. Every task feels samey, the enemies are boring, and the acting feels like it did before anybody with any decent acting ability would voice characters in a game. I find it impossible to care about anything that happens.  Despite all that, if this game actually had come out for the PS2, or for the PC at the same time as, say, Star Wars Battlefront, it would have been amazing. I would have loved it, and I would have played it for hours on end. Now, however, it's just filled with that sense of disappointment you get when you go to play a game from your childhood that you loved (GTA3, for example) and it's just terrible by today's standards.   For a better super-jumping, punch-exploding open-world experience pick up Saints Row IV when it's on sale. It's better on every possible level, unless your only deciding factor is whether or not a game has zombies.",0
"Boring mechanics, dumb enemies. Buy if you absolutely have nothing better to do with your time.  (Note: Play time is off, I've actually spent 12ish hours in this)",0
Doesn't Work. Want my money back. 2 gtx 670s and intel i7 3930k cpu and 32gigs of ram. Can run almost any game on the face of the planet yet activison and steam is telling me it's my rig. Well I'll suggest save your money and do not buy prototype. Interesting enough second one works. maybe a different studio i don't know. Prototype 2 isn't as good as the first imo.,0
"Not as good as it seems. Despite its an open world game it's sorta buggy, And sometimes your computer will lag if your surrounded by many enemies. Sometimes you will be attacked from many places and you'll get hurt without knowing where the enemy is shooting from. But, hey if you like the game good for you.",0
The game itself is pretty great actually. BUT DO NOT BUY IT if you had a hex core processor. You need to turn off some cores manually in order to launch the game.,0
"The visual engines of both Prototype games behave in a strange manner:  1. They need to run at 60 frames per second on 60 Hertz to have smooth motion, were it not for the insane amounts of stuttering. This stuttering looks very much like an extremely severe case of microstutter, yet I only run a single GPU setup (1 x GTX 780 TI).  2. Running the games beyond 60 fps (either through disabling the vsync or running at higher Hz) make them look like a 30 fps game. It looks like the engine repeats every frame even though any framerate counter will state that the games run smoothly at any Hz rate the monitor is set. (eg. 100 fps on a 100 Hz display, but it looks exactly like running a constant 50 fps on 100 Hz.)  Both engine faults give me a headache when I try to play the games.  I've tried every 'fix' I could find on the internet (including disabling all HID devices, running at the lowest in-game graphics settings, adding command line parameters, setting processor affinity, using the resolution fix .dll, etc.) and none worked for me.  So I know this isn't much of a review of the game itself. It might be good, but I never got to experience it myself because of these technical issues which I admit being sensitive to. Therefore, I can hardly recommend the game, now can I? I did, after all, not have a fun time playing this game.  As such I feel I need to not recommend it. You might not have issues with it however, so keep that in mind. Yet, I still wanted to write these words of warning to those few people who might have issues with this game if smooth motion is kind of a must for them, or to those who loathe bad PC ports in general.",0
"Bad controls, bad animations, bad dialog, bad ballence. This is a bad game. It's not ♥♥♥♥, it's not like i'm mad they got my money, it's just bad enough I wish I didn't own it because I'm not going to play it.",0
bad game for PC users. The game will crash all the time. Not werth the money. ,0
Won't run on a newer comp without old drivers.... And it is only played in lower resolutions.,0
"This game as well as the sequel are good on console.. but awful on pc. The gameplay is frustrating on any difficulty (I tried it on multiple difficulties) and it is at the point where I cant play this with mouse + keyboard without slamming my head against a wall. Get it only if it is under $5 and you have a controller to play with. To the developers that shutdown - Thank you for shutting down your atrocious company, have a nice day, f**k off, and I will be back to beat your s****y game once I get a controller to use.",0
"It's an pretty cool concept, but the controls for this game felt very slippery which made things a bit more difficult than it really was.",0
"Wow. This game DID NOT age well by any means... Bland, repetetive, and awful graphics...",0
"I was pretty excited about it based on reviews and what I heard from friends, and the intro section was a lot of fun, where it gives you all sorts of ridiculous abilities and lets you just run around destroying things for half an hour to learn how the game works. Unfortunately, immediately after that it takes away every single one of your fun toys and makes you start over with absolutely nothing. 'Here, go play a completely different game that isn't any fun at all instead for several hours and earn the right to have fun again,' it says. I slowly started unlocking some of the neat things I'd enjoyed playing with in the tutorial, and it got a bit better, but it was too little too slowly, and I got bored five hours in before it was able to recapture that initial excitement.  For random comparison's sake, it feels a lot like a single-player version of DCUO to me, only with tighter controls and a much less interesting, less colorful world, with a fairly bland story and unlikable characters. The gameplay probably would've been enough to save it if it hadn't completely turned me off by taking away all my fun I was having.",0
"Honestly, I find this game to be extremely boring and repetitive. It all comes down to two big things; you vs military, you vs big bad monsters. And as you advance in the story, the enemy simply get a power-up (as well as you).  The missions are all the same, you either infiltrate a military base/destroy monster base or kill the 'boss' (which is simply one of the power-up enemies that you will now find everywhere).  If this wasn't enough, the controls are actually quite clunky, camera/targeting is extremely confusing at times.   Also the story was quite a letdown.",0
"This game is super repetative. I did not enjoy any part of it, to be honest. I do not recommend. :C",0
"So, I purchased this game on the Summer Sale of 2014, so I'm not too upset about the amount of cash I spent on this game. At first the game delivers a very fun feeling in the introduction. After that you're stripped of all your power and made to play out Alex Mercer's story. The story seems interesting enough that might make me want to go back and play this game.  What truly turned me off about this game was the combat system. Holy ♥♥♥♥ the combat is more clunky then 1980's T1100. When trying to pick up firearms from dead enemies you better get ready to press that button over and over (so help you god if you have an enemy near you and you end up grabbing him instead). Also, the first hunter encounter, oh god..... is that suppose to be a challenge? That isn't a challenge, that's just annoying. The targeting system is counter-intuitive at best, 'Oh let me target the guy in front....aaaaand I targeted the tank behind me). I want to enjoy this game, but holy ♥♥♥♥ I think I have to either get high turn or just tune it down to easy and faceroll it. (I really don't want to do that)  P.S. Is it just me, or this game's audio is really low or what?   P.S.S A game from 2009 that doesn't support 1920x1080 without a fix is kinda sad. ",0
"Pure crap. Don't buy it. It's no wonder the makers went out of business.  #1) The game is rediculously hard.  #2) Because it's so hard, you'll never make it to the end. I wanted to see how the story turned out, but just couldn't get past a certain point.  #3) There are no cheat codes, so you can't just turn on god mode and then continue with the story just to see what happens.  Pure crap. Don't buy it.",0
"I didn't enjoy even a second in this game. Many frustrating things, like controls and movement. Even the story wasn't good. Prototype just isn't fun, nor entertaining.",0
+ Solid Framerate - 1FPS  got 80 mins into and didn't even get to the main menu,0
well for 10$ i am really disapoited though i bought the game to try it out and stuff but after playing 5 seconds of it i am going to uninstall it i wasted my 10$ on this game to which it could have gone to something a lot better then low graphic ♥♥♥♥ game and the funny thing is that i had had the setting set to the max and still played like ♥♥♥♥ the movement was bad the look of is was bad sad to say this but i wish i got my money back for this game so i HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND this game,0
I thought this game was boring. The map was just the same buildings spammed over and over. Hulk Ultimate Destruction is the same kind of game but much more enjoyable imho.,0
"I equate this game to herding a bunch of sheep into a very small corral and then squishing them all at once with a giant hammer. That may sound weird but its the way it is. This game story makes no sense and all of the npc civilians just wander around waiting to be mass squished. They dont even react to whats happening in their environment in any logical way(I mean, at least sheep would try to run away in real life). Anyway, on metacritic I notice its mostly young guys who give this game high marks. Guys who get a kick out of squishing mass quantities of npcs for no particular reason. If thats what you're looking for then buy this game! If you prefer a story behind your squishing, or a story with a hero you can relate to in some way, or ANYTHING else to go along with your squishing, DONT buy this game. You wont be happy. Gameplay is fun for about the first hour and then you realize you are doing the same thing over and over and over and none of it makes sense.",0
"Won't make it past the first cutscene despite having 8x more RAM than needed as well as a graphics card which blows this game out of the water. I loved Prototype on Xbox, but this virtualization is just ♥♥♥♥.",0
Worst Game and bad controls. Everything is bad about it.,0
 Cons  -Terrible story -terrible optimization for pc -gameplay that consists of janky movement and a useless array of powers -boss fights and missions that revolve around throwing ♥♥♥♥ and using rocket lauchers -game literally gives you the best power and armor and thinks you'll still use the other 4 options -pressing two buttons at the same time has never been harder  Pros  -Trust me i tried,0
"Was a terrible game, you basically start off as your end game there is no feelinging of progression or accomplishment. Story is very linear and boring. For a game made back in 2009 it looks like it was made in the year 2006. You can more or less completely obliterate anything that is an enemy and makes it feel WAAAY to easy you can't even play on the more difficult settings until you've completed the game once. So it's a peace of cake until you've played it at least 3 times through which makes it more boring then the previous 2/3 times you've already played it...  In conclusion don't buy this game go buy something better save your money just don't buy this game. ",0

"This is a warning, this game is absolutely terrible. As soon as I start up the game I attempt to configure it for my 1080p screen and there is no 1080p option!!!! I felt like I was just slapped in the face!! I looked up this issue on the internet and found that the developers limited the resolutions based on the graphics cards memory, below 512mb and you are severely limited. My graphics card has 2 GB of memory and yet it doesnt allow me to have a 1080 resolution, this feature is severely broken.  Then there is the issue with the stuttering. My graphics card is very good and the processor is also high end but when I move my mouse around to look it moves as if there are set directions you can look at instead of a fluid motion that allows you to look wherever you want.  Conclusion, the game is not playable in my opinion. And this is not even considering that the game provides no challenge whatsoever, it makes you a unstoppable war machine. Don't get this game until it's free (ie, never)",0
Its mindless arcade fun where you become so powerful you can't help but behave deviously. Its a bad console port and had a memory leak that caused me to have to restart it every hour or so. Cant recommend it.,0

"The good thing of Prototype is that you are a superhuman that can destroy/slice/throw everything you see but that is pretty much it. Graphic aged badly, the combos available are too much in number and it's easy to screw up when you need to use a specific attack, the autoaim is slow and if you don't use it it's easy to dash in the wrong way but the worst thing is the story. It's undeveloped, told in a messed up way and full of plot holes, easily the worst I ever seen in an action game and one of the worst ever. Even for 5€ you may don't want this game...",0

"Terrible port, just don't even bother. I purchased Prototype for 5$ and feel ripped off, it doesn't even have 1920x1080 resolution, cutscene audio cutes in and out and crackles every 5 seconds, audio sounds distorted, game preforms like sh!t on a 1,000$ rig, can't even play on high (Not to mention there is no FPS slider!) Can't even tell if the game is good, the port is so bad that I can't even put up with it. I regret buying such a broken port, and wish I didn't support it.  0/10 for everything.",0

This is just a Prototype, you start the game and it plays a intro movie and thats it you can move or do anything its not even a game in its current state its a bunch of bull. How does this have some many good reviews when you can't even play it? I really think the other reviews are fake to trick people into buying the game its a big scam and i am feed up! I talked with brother who took a law class in High School and he said it was 'BullSh!t' so if hopefully this will change your mind. The intro movie is still really cool i just wanted to play something and not watch something so i will give it a 9 out 10 but still not recommend because it isnt a game.",0
"if you have played the second game then you will appreciate what this was trying to be, but wasn't. The main problem is the 'double tap' to initiate free running which somehow just doesn't perform as it should, and given that you need to move fast when the helicopters descend, it just raises the anger level. I also found that the character would lose punch ability and a restart was needed to regain it and also sometimes the 'exit vehicle' option didn't seem to work. The second game is a classic but the first is not really worth the money, even if you want tpo see where it all started.",0

"A bad port that controls like ♥♥♥. The writing is pretty horrendous, too, but it's the sort of thing you'd forgive for the chance to throw trucks at police helicopters if it played worth a damn. This game really wants to be that badass Hulk PS2 game from years ago but it just ain't.",0

"Awesome game overall, the superpowers, destruction and the city just feels great. The negative things about the game is that the pc port is bad. First of is the max resoltion is 720p. The shadows and graphics are outdated even if you compare it to other games made 2009. There is next to no no graphics options  Framerate problems Awful keyboard and mouse controls  Its a game worth playing, its just no advantage to play it on PC.",0
"This game was a mess. The controls were really touchy and the lockon system was completely counter-intuitive and made it almost impossible to lockon the the target you really wantedmaking it feel like you pushed the buttons first then crossed your fingers and hoped your character moved the right way. The main character's powers were mediocre when used in battle, it was better to just steal enemy weapons and vehicles to fight with giving the feeling that his powers were more why he was hunted than what made him cool. The characters were unrelatable and the story , while it had a good premise, felt poorly executed. Add on that a half-dozen of the side quests were broken in an amazingly frustrating fashion and I have to say I'm suprised I finished the game at all.",0

Crashes upon starting a new game or loading a save,0
"I must say that one of the final combat before the final boss did make me totally rage because it is incredibly hard. I never did it, so I never finished the game.  To do quick. The pros : The gameplay is seriously amazing, even if surreal. The open world is really nice. The possibility to absorb everybody is kinda cool too. The cons : The storyline is boring. The militaries are such noobs it's amazing they are still in the army. The final boss is not reachable (see my first paragraph). You cannot possibly love the main character (you do however can like the other characters, it's not a problem). The dialogues are soooo basic.  What is not a pro nor a con : You can kill everybody if you like. The violence really graphic and clear in the game. Not really safe for work.",0

"Looking at this game, you're probably wondering...'Should I buy [Prototype]?'. It depends. Prototype is a basically the definition of a murder simulator. All you do in this game is kill and attempt to hide.  The AI is crap, the locations are meh, you see the same civilian about a billion times in the same area you are in, the missions have barely any variety (other than kill more people and run up a building) and Alex Mercer is so emo its not even funny.   So should you get this game? The only thing [Prototype] has that GTA, Saint's Row, and Just Cause don't have is extreme gore and constant killing in grotesque ways. If you want something with a bit more depth than that, I would advise you to look somewhere else. Otherwise, welcome to New York, Mr. Mercer.  Verdict: PASS",0

"It is an OK game. Gameplay is repetitive, and story is very dumb. To get the whole story you have to consume peoples memories, which is a very daunting task just to know what the hell is going. I wish the character was more engaging. They also used the same cutscene three different times in game.(where he is talking to soldier and helicopters attack in backround). Compared to the hulk ultimate destruction this game doesn't do much to innovate.",0

"I had this game on the PlayStation3 and it was kinda enjoyable. Ripping and tearing apart innocent citizens and soldiers alike, destroying everything, ellbow-slamming a tank - there will be gore and explosions everywhere. Sounds decent, right?  A little.  Only problem is the controls where a bit clunky (even on the PS3) and I had massive problems focussing and attacking the enemy I actually wanted. Another funbreaker is the fact that you're easily being bounced back, even by small and weak enemies. It's even worse when stronger enemies and helicopters chase you. Sometimes you're feeling like a ball in a pinball machine.  This game has so much potential and with proper implementation this propably would have been the best anti-aggression-game and there is. I mean, you have all those amazing powers! From disguise to running at super speed to hammerfists (lets you smash tanks), clawhands (rips and tears everything apart), whiplash (for taking down distant enemies), superjumping, semi-flying (gliding). You can even throw buses into helicopters and stuff, the list goes on and it's awesome.  But you're almost not able to live it up.  The story is ok and acceptable. The missions are way too hard and not fun at all (I'm not a good gamer, though). In one mission you have to flee. Excuse me? I'm a godlike creature and can destroy a tank with a single blow with my ellbow, why the heck should I flee?  That's boring and uninspiring. It's like getting a Lamborghini in a racing game and the game tells you to drive not faster than 30 miles per hour. Unfortunately, I didn't find any cheats or mods for this game. I think with a little effort like removing all the time based missions and the bouncing this would be just awesome.  If you can get this game for a decent price (it's under 10 dollars mostly, on Humble Bundle even cheaper) and if you do like gore, GO GET IT and happy ripping and tearing bodies apart for a while. I really hope you could do an devastator attack on some people out there who are wasting so much potential. It hurts, especially as a creative person.",0
"No matter how much I struggled, fought, and screamed, this game would NOT run on my pc, which can play almost every game on Steam on max, or high settings at LEAST.

"I managed to get half-way through PROTOTYPE and ended up writing over my save file in an act of confusion, all because the developers made one of the worst PC ports I've ever played. There's no chance I'll be playing through all of this again anytime soon.  Here's the main issues I had with what would be an otherwise fun and enjoyable game:  • Shadows are completely nonexistent for those who have AMD graphic cards.  • It's impossible to continue without having the game crash. In order to fix this you need to start a new game with a new save, quit back to the main menu after the first cutscene, and then load your original save file. This is where I got confused, after not playing for so long, and managed to save over my old file.  • The volume in this game is extremely low. I play with headphones, for almost every game I'll usually set the volume to around 40% through the little controller on my headset. I find it hard to hear at 100% with PROTOTYPE, there's no other way to increase the volume.  There are no fixes for these issues, there's no FOV slider which would help with how claustrophobic the screen is. The developer went bankrupt and no one gives a ♥♥♥♥ about the people who bought this in such a broken state, so I insist you not waste your time and money or you'll only end up as frustrated as I am right now.",0
"The story is uninspired and the main character is as bland as stale toast. The camera and the targetting are on the same stick so you will constantly find yourself in situations where you have to choose between panning the camera or getting a lock on something - only to have that target switch to yet another unlabeled target whether you have line of sight or not. You'll be ragdolled out of maneuvers constantly. This includes 'consuming' people to restore your health. This means you'll grab someone, start to eat them and have the animation interrupted by one of the dozen (at least) incoming attacks. Maybe it's a bulky melee hunter, maybe it's splash damage from the thirty-five missles and tank rounds, doesn't matter. Trying to restore health anywhere near an active battle (and the battle will follow you around corners, onto rooftops, and also see through your disguise instantly once the Super Soldiers enter the fight) is literally setting yourself up to be mauled. I'm lead to believe the studio that created this piece of ♥♥♥♥ went out of business. With the design decisions they made here I have to say everyone who plays videogames is better off.",0
"Let me start off by saying that the concept of this game is amazing. Who doesn't dream of having super powers? Being able to run, jump, and glide across city blocks in the blink of an eye is quite the rush. On top of that, being able to shapeshift at will (as a disguise or to transform your body into devestating weaponry).  The problem for me is after about 10 hours of playtime, why am I struggling to find the will to continue playing?  There's a story, but it feels like a narrative that I'm unlocking rather than experiencing. It's completly mission-based. The game quickly turns into a free-roam-the-city-to-start-x-event. To become more powerful I destroy and kill everything. To complete missions I destroy and kill. To learn more about the story... destroy and kill. Let me put it another way... you get reports on how many kills you get and how much money you cost the military, and the higher these numbers are the better your score is.  I could really only reccomend this game to people who: a. Like GTA style games (maybe only those who really enjoy stealing tanks and trying to evade the police) or b. Are into the revenge genre",0
Horrible game. I cant compleat it because of glitches and controls,0
Broken ♥♥♥ sound problems if you are using an onboard sound card. Fixes found online just break other parts of game. Either way completely unplayble unless you like playing games completly muted.,0
"Not the game, but the port is poor. I booted it up to have major sound issues where everyone talked so fast they sounded like a record skipping. This was atop poor resolution issues, and I coudln't get far enough to say if the controls were wonky or not. Don't buy unless you're willing to play tech support hero to make the game run.",0
"Prototype has its ups and downs, but more downs that ups. The main character has some super fun super powers that allow you to do some really crazy things as you fly, jump, or run (horizontally and vertically) through the city.The game also looks pretty good. The story seems really fascinating as well, but that's about where the good ends.   First off, the city gets pretty boring pretty quickly as there is nothing really unique about the city that makes any part of the city look any different from another part. I found myself just following the quest markers on the mini map and not trying to learn the city at all. I never knew where I was unless I pulled up the main map. There are lots of cool powers, but when the fights get going you are so busy running around trying to stay alive and kill that you never really get any time to really bask in the fun of watching a cool ability when it is triggered.   The main negative is that it appears that the controls for the PC port didn't translate properly. The keyboard presses are super sensitive. I've been using this keyboard for a few years and dozens of games, so I am comfortable with it, but I never had such problems with the keyboard in any other game than I did with Prototype. To top it off there was no sweetspot for mouse sensitivity either. Either it took HUGE hand sweeps to turn left and right, with the mouse, or my camera would go sitr crazy at the slightest twitch when trying to adjust the sensitivity. Also y-axis sensitivity was way more sensitive than the x-axis.    As a result, I could barely control my character as I bounced off walls, hitting things, or attacking things except the actual mob I had selected as my target. My character looked cool going bat crap crazy all over the fight zone, but if this game had been real life, the people I was fighting would have thought I was an idiot as they easily gunned me down, which is what happened during game play very often. I eventually got so ultra ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the lack of character control that I finally quit and removed the game from my system. Experiencing the story wasn't enough of a draw to make me spend many frustrating hours getting killed constantly and wander through a boring city. I'll read the story on Wikipedia or something.",0
"I really want to like this game, but can't. The idea is great and your 'super powers' are awesome and so fun to use. But the difficulty level is all over the place, some missions are extremely simple while others are extremely hard. And the combat... Everytime you take a hit you get stunned for a while, so you often find yourself taking a chain of hits which you can't do anything about. It makes some missions extremely frustrating.  Try Saints Row 4 instead. It has taken the super powers from Prototype but removed the frustrating parts of the gameplay.",0
"Unplayable one of the worst ports I have ever played. Solid 13 fps no matter what the settings even on the menu's, audio was skipping in cut scene's and some resolution bug ment I had to play it in 720p.

"The most I've ever disliked a sandbox game. Boring, tedious and stupid.",0
"Great game, tons of fun when I played it a long time ago on a rig with Windows Vista. But if you have Windows 7 or later, forget about this game because it will be nothing but god awful trouble getting it to run, which is why I voted to not recommend it. If you do, have a xbox 360 controller to play this because if you use a mouse and keyboard it stutters horribly. If you have Win7 or higher, go for Prototype 2. And use a wired xbox 360 controller for that too because using keyboard and mouse also causes stuttering in that game as well.",0
"Buy Prototype 2 instead. The original is a terrible game - as the game progresses, they use more and more cheap methods to prevent you from getting your attacks off - interrupt upon interrupt upon interrupt. Your targeting seems to target the WORST possible targets, no matter what weapon you use. Again, this happens more and more as the game progresses. This game sucks. Prototype 2 on the other hand, is a fantastic game.  Don't buy this stinker. Save your money, and use it to buy Prototype 2.",0
"Don't buy this.   Lots of consolitis in this one. A camera that wants to do its own thing and frequent slow character animations that take you out of the gameplay. Third-person platforming. Enemy AI is terrible, and enemies just spawn around you rather than following a sensible path through the city. There is no persistence to the game world, making the missions to clean up the city completely pointless. The missions themselves are repetitive. Ends in a frustrating final boss fight,",0

"Would be a decent game if the bosses weren't ridiculously overpowered, the game has many bugs one being that it crashes A LOT. Meaning you have to restart A LOT of missions because you can't save during them.  I appreciate it's an old game but come on, it can't be this bloody awful.",0

"While I do love the detail put into the dismemberment and gore of this game, the story falls short and well, to be honest, some things feel weird.  I know, I know... 'It's an old game.' But that's not an excuse for the cars to seat deformed polygonal people inside. Some little things like that broke the inmersion and overall experience for me in big ways.  I'd say check out Saints Row 4. It's this game on steroids but add some personality, mature comedy and a slew of mini-games as well.  This isn't a terribly bad game, there's just better alternatives that are now available on the Steam market and well, this isn't worth the asking price. A fair price for this game would be 25% of what they are asking for.",0

"Prototype is an action-adventure open world game. You are Alex Mercer, a man without memory armed with amazing superhuman powers and the option to go most anywhere you like and do most anything you want once you get there. A virus outbreak has claimed Manhattan, forcing the island into a military quarantine. The infected citizens turning the population into mutants. The main story path is entirely linear. The missions are a sloppy mix of poorly paced ideas. Long missions involve simply going from one end of Manhattan to the other, while some of the short missions are climactic sieges and battles. Missions can be brutally challenging, often because of the uncooperative auto-lock system. Boss battles are much longer than they need to be and more often test your endurance rather than your skill. As you work your way through the game, you will earn experience points that can be used to unlock new and ever more exotic powers. Experience points are also the only thing you get by finding collectibles. The graphics are not the best, buildings and environments are ugly, so the world is not a place you want to explore.  All in all, the awful boring and repeating missions and linear gameplay ruins the overall experience.

There's no atmosphere and the main character is very two demensional with the sole goal to kill everyone that experimented on him.",0

"This game sucks.  Want an in-depth review why this game sucks? I found the sound messed up really hard so I could barely hear the dialogue when there was any. It didn't stop me from understanding the story, but it did ♥♥♥♥ me off. The story is boring. It's a typical amnesiac with super powers trying to figure out the past. I liked it better when it was the Bourn Identity.  Gameplay started out funny but immediately got stale. I really don't care for stealth missions and I didn't see a need for them in this game, but it went ahead &amp; gave me stealth missions anyway. The whole thing felt poorly balanced. You're this super ultra killing machine and there's always a seemingly infinite number of soldiers on the screen all spread out shooting at you at all times and you're trying to kill enough guys to keep regenerating health. Then they introduce these mutant alien things that take for god damn ever to kill. I got really tired of fighting those things after about the 28th time.  You can steal vehicles, but it wasn't really adding anything to the gameplay. About 8 or so missions in, I just got bored of the game and decided this wasn't worth finishing. I was on normal and I started out laughing like 'hahaha this is so easy' to having a heart attack trying to finish a mission. I get that there were more super powers to upgrade, they seemed mostly useless from the description. The novelty of the game wears off after about half an hour or so. It just didn't seem like it was worth finishing.",0
Big arms and Flesh everywhere. It was bad. (3/10),0
"Having looked through my reviews on steam, to see which had been helpful, I noticed my review for Prototype had only 2/7 upvotes. Since my free trial on PS Now has just run out, to get over my craving for infamous, I decided to look for games like it on PC. Prototype was the closest thing people could come up with, so I redownloaded it.  I forgot why I disliked this game so much. But as I said before, the controls were off, the camera was dodgy and the graphics were poor even when I had disabled some things to get it above 30fps and downloaded a fix for the resolution cap of 720p.  The controls feel like they were made for a controller, and it is trying to take the same input from a keyboard and mouse, but one of the most infuriating things is how aiming moves requires an analogue stick and so it is very difficult to aim attacks. Also, the camera changes sensitivity depending on what is happening, which may be alright for someone experienced with a controller, but with a mouse it is the height of frustration.  Also, whilst I suppose people who only use one monitor may not be bothered by the resolution, it is forcibly set to 30fps and 720p which is not only annoying, but it makes the game unplayable in many situations.  Once you have fixed the resolution and frame rate cap, and gotten used to the controls, I suppose the game is ok. I don't remember the story from when I spent most of my time in it, but that doesn't mean it is bad. The graphics are poor (not aged well in my opinion, still rather polygonal in some areas, and flat textures trying to mimic rough textures), apart from abilities which look rather cool because they are meant to be black masses. I don't like the gameplay enough to play for long periods of time, although the carnage you are capable of wreaking is fun in short bursts.  I wouldn't buy this game, as it isn't story heavy so I can't see any problem with getting prototype 2 if you have to have a game like this. If you want a game like infamous, as I do, I guess the best course of action would be getting better internet and paying for PS Now, which isn't that tempting (as it costs quite a lot, and you have to pay that amount every month with no discount for buying several months in the UK)",0

"I always wondered if this game was good or not since I first heard of it years ago. Yet, in the end it's really not that speical. The story is weak and a complete button masher. I don't mind button mashers but the story should at least be stronger than what is presented. The plot is simple and boring but the idea of the story is good. It was just poorly brought out. Even though I can play almost any game, I feel that I would have to force myself to get through this one. If I wanted to play a game similar to this, but better, I would play InFamous. Yet, I can not complain too much about the game. The idea and upgrades are cool. It's fun if you want to cause complete chaos with your overpowered character, but that's it.",0
Nothing but gratuitous killing. Where's my refund?,0
"Bought this on sale and let it sit a year in my library before finally installing it. Sadly, I have the opening cinematic crash problem others in the forum have mentioned experiencing (game crashes to desktop upon starting a new game). Don't know the root cause (the game being six years old at the time of writing may be a factor, I'm sure), but for me at least the game is literally unplayable. Obviously. there's no patch ever coming. Pity! I was looking forward to finally sitting down with this game. Hoping for better luck with the sequel...",0
It could be a good game but its just not working. after fixing the reselution and the sound bug i though i can play a great game now. But no. Even if i have a strong PC the game starts to lag. In the cut scenes the sounds i buggy even if i fixed it before. Also it only supports xbox360 controllers which forced me to play with keyboard and mouse.  I think his shouldt be for sale because its not even working.  Story i interesting tho even if i only got the beginning.,0
"Not happy with this along with Prototype 2, i have played these games on the Xbox 360 platform and i do enjoy these games, i have migrated most of my game play to the PC as i CBA to buy multiple platforms to play the games i like the most, on purchase and download of these games via steam ( Taking into account my Pc Specs i shall disclose below this comment ), i found myself disappointed.  I Cannot run Prototype 1 without serious lag and on the games lowest settings and its tedious that prototype 2 just does not load ( Crashed during basic startup ) i have reinstalled these twice and ensured my rig has its SLI correctly setup for the game.  I ran system requirments lab and well it says i have the minimum for prototype 1 ( il post the link also as its still confussing as it will not disclose the Recommended )  I have both minimum and Recommended for Prototype 2 ( again i can post the link )  My system is pretty high spec and high performance and i can play without a doubt Most games...there has not been a game ive played that i have had issues with and my hardware is quite recent.   i have also tried to go to activation for support but their support for this game on these games for this platform do not come avaliable on their website.....which is frustrating as there is a need for it i believe.  anyway here are the specs of my pc ( Below ) and all in all i would not recommend anyone buying th pc versions of this if they are below the spec i am about to post.

"This game will load (which is more than I can say for Prototype 2) but i get a framerate of 5. only 5. frames per second. so i'm glad i got it on sale for $5 but i would have rather gotten a burger, at least i would have been able to do something with that.",0
"its worth about 3 minutes and 11 seconds of entertainment. SO, how much are you willing to pay for that?",0
"An interesting concept brought low by mediocre writing, acting, and rocket-launcher stun-lock. Also, the PC controls are about as precise as waggling a dead salmon at the screen.  This is not to say that you can't still have fun with the game, just that fun doesn't seem to have been in the original design document.",0
"Let me start off by saying, this game has over 250 collectables. 50 of those...are tips on how to play the game. Yes that's right, you'll be searching for tips on how to play the game, that you've mastered to the point that you're concerned about getting collectables....Yep.  Apart from that, the art direction is cool, the pre-rendered cutscenes are awesome, but the story and in game cutscenes leave much to be desired. The gameplay is fun, but has way too many poorly planned challenges and mission requirements which will make you pull your hair out.  Buy Saints Row 4 if you want to run around having fun with super powers. Buy Resident Evil if you want an outbreak storyline about mutant monsters. Don't buy this game (unless there's a steam sale, then why not right?)",0
DO NOT GET THIS GAME.. ITS A GIANT TURD THAT WONT FLUSH.  It doesnt work and there is 0 support for it. You wont even get an answer from the company that makes it.,0
"Warning: This is a review on how the game runs and not the actual gameplay, mechanics, or other features  Guys just dont do this to yourselves. The game will not run on your computer unless you do some crazy internal work deep within the dark unknown of your computer's settings and disable a whole bunch of things that you have no idea what they do. I repeat IT WILL NOT RUN......PERIOD. It doesnt matter what kind of computer you have. (If its a computer with better specs it runs worse then before)   Now, if you did find out how to get the game to run, good for you man its a pretty fun game. To clear this up it is not IMPOSSIBLE to get it to run eventually it is just very COMPLICATED to do so.",0
"Overall: not a bad game, but has many annoyances that will add up and impair your fun:  -several sections of the game are just plain obnoxious (getting swarmed with enemies that knock you down every few seconds EACH)  -due to above obnoxiousness, standard strategy is to /not/ use your mutant ability arsenal and instead steal a tank and fire from a safe distance.  -Web of Intrigue is cool but no way to tell where targets are unless you are very nearby, so getting a full Web means running on foot through every street.  -Abilities are interesting but only 2-3 'modes' are well developed  -events are repetative and bland (kill x within y, time trials)  -City is big and parkouring is fun, but its visually boring.  -On the plus side, the stealth AI is hilariously inept. You can literally drive a tank down the streets, mowing over civillians and cars, and still be completely undetected.",0
"I tried really hard to like Prototype. It has an interesting enough story, tons of power to murder many, many people with, but simply put, it runs terrible. It averages maybe 20 FPS, dropping into low single digits if more than just the main character are on the screen (often). The menu is clunky, and the controls and uninutitve and unresponsive.",0
Fun for a few hours...not much past that.,0
more like phototype because of the bad frame rate,0
"This IS a good game. BUT BE WARNED -  Multiplayer is littered with hackers and cheaters.    There is a noticable number of players who are one or more of the following:    Invincible    Able to kick other players at will    Able to unlock max rank etc.    Using aim bots    Using wall hacks    Have unlimited knife/melee distance    Able to control public lobbies as if they were private ones    and various other things.   Infinity Ward/Activision don't care, they're busy squeezing cash out of fanboys' pockets. I've contacted Activision support multiple times, and they literally don't care at all. Considering they're still charging £20 for the game, I'd say that's disgusting...  It's a great shame, because it has a great single-player, great co-op, and the multiplayer IS good, but people have ruined it. All I can really do at this point is go to their Steam profiles and report a violation. Some people will rage in the text chat 'why must you hack? it's ruining the game' or similar, and 99% of the time the response is 'hahaha cry more' or 'shut up u ♥♥♥♥♥♥', as you'd expect. It's be GLORIOUS if these toxic people were VAC banned, but I doubt any of the higher-ups will do anything about it.  Not so much angry, as I am sad.  Edit: Steam displays my hours played in single player. I currently have 69 hours in multiplayer at time of edit.  Edit 2: The 'unhelpful' votes for this review are from fanboys who are infatuated with grenade launchers, trickshots, and probably some hackers themselves.  Which reminds me... the playerbase in MW2 is   outrageously   toxic. The number of times I've been called a f#ggot, had cancer wished upon, been told to kill myself, insulted for using a certain weapon or equipment... seriously, someone wished for my mother to die of explosive diarrhoea because I was using an MP5K. I don't get it.",0
If you like hackers you'll love this game.,0
"IT's a good game, but hackers are crazy on this one. and then you geta VAC ban and you cant play it any more",0
"What to say about Modern Warfare 2? Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.  Now, you may be asking,  'Why is the multiplayer dead?'  The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hackers and children. Hackers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hacker, another five are going to take that persons place.   The game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warefare 1, World at War, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review. Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and 'clean' of hackers and cheaters.  Some examples of hackers in Modern Warfare 2, are people who use:    Wallhackers   Aimbots   Instant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL Unlocks   Hud-Hacking (Yes, it does exist)    Instant VAC Ban   The Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in MW2 that are safe.  Please, please,  please  watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.  I've heard that Search and Destroy games are  safe , but the player count is very little in most game types.   If you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small.  I wish all of you people luck.  Overall, get it for the Spec-Ops, and the Singleplayer.  Edit: I no longer play MW2. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hacked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.  Stay safe, and play safe...and watch for hackers...  -Cheers  ",0
"As for singleplayer, it's good, but too short and lacks options.  As for multiplayer, all it is is a cancerous daycare center for 9 year olds.",0
"A great and excellent game but too many hackers, making it unplayable.",0
"Most people remember this game as the last good Call Of Duty Game. The multiplayer is good, but you should probably buy this on console. The multiplayer is entirely plagued with hackers. The neglect from Infinity Ward and hacking has gotten so bad to the point where hackers can ruin your game, and since Steam cloud saves your data, it's impossible to fix in some cases. There's no word from Steam when the community asks for soloutions.  There are groups of legit players who play private matches, if you can find one, it's fun, but that's more of a tactic to avoid hackers for people who already have the game.  Some of the things hackers can do is change your resoloution, your minimap size (to the point where it takes up the whole screen.) These problems can be fixed by deleting you config files and verifying your cache. They can also corrupt your rank, and this can't be fixed, unless you get into another hacked lobby and they rank you up to 70.  This is a GOOD multiplayer game, but I'm going to thumb it down because of how prevelent hackers are, and people should know about. Unless you already have people to play with, I wouldn't buy it for PC.",0
"This is going to be my first not recommended, but not because of the game because it's a great game. I had so many good memories of playing this game on Xbox 360 a couple years back, but that was not the experience I came back to. The servers are now all full of hackers and aimbotters and players that are invincible. I was so hoping to jump back in when a friend bought it and play a couple games with them and really show them how much fun a Call of Duty can be before all the added stuff from Black Ops onwards. Please do not purchase this game unless you do not plan to play multiplayer (which that is the only reason I purchased it). Fair warning to all.",0
" -----EDIT-------  A lot of people have been accusing me of cheating in MW2 Multiplayer lately. This is entirely false, I did not cheat whatsoever. At the time I was playing there were (and probably still are) A LOT of hacked lobbies. What happened to me was I logged into a modded game. After being in it for few seconds it disconnected me from it with a message saying ' Bad host '. So I was like ok but then I noticed that literally all of the stats were unlocked (Titles, Emblems, Weapons and their attachemnts, etc.), it also boosted me from being a lvl 30 or something noob to a lvl 70, allowing me to enter prestige mode. I didn't deal with that, just a bit worried. I looked up on some forum, found that people encountered the same problem and that you need to contact support as soon as possible otherwise it'll ban you. I didn't know at the time how to deal with it so I went with the flow, hoping nothing will happen to my account. Then after a few weaks I recieved a ban, saying ' Cheat detected '. I then tried to contact any support but people on the forum stated it's too late because Steam Support won't listen to people who got VAC banned.  ALSO NOTE:  I remembered that around the initial VAC ban my account was hijacked and couldn't retrieve it after a year when a Steam Support finally realized the issue. I assume that the hijacker went downloading the possible external software for the game and used it on it in order to get me banned. I remember that guy, go check him up, his name is 'solutioNNN' and also has a VAC ban from MW2. I am not lying about this, no I am not making this up, this is my honest review.  -------------------  Singleplayer: Wonderful! Special Ops: Wonderful, even co-op is great! Multiplayer: THE WORST, EVERY TIME YOU GO TO LOBBY, YOU COULD ENTER A HACKED ONE, RESULTING IN UNLOCKING EVERY WEAPON, WEAPON ATTACHMENT, EMBLEM, TITLE, ETC. THIS WILL RESULT IN A UNFAIR VAC BAN. I do not recommend this game simply because of this mess. I recommend you to pirate this game just to experience the wonderful storyline. Oh, and if you happen to buy it and find that your items are all unlocked, I suggest you contacting the Steam Support before   getting a possible permanent ban .",0
"IF You intend to play the campaign and special ops buy the game and have fun!  IF You only want to the multiplayer, You will be facing the most irritating cheater and also the worst community of all Call od Duty games. For multiplayer buy other games, including other COD's but surely not this one.",0
"Game itself is great. Hackers have ruined multiplayer, though, and they just laugh and change their name and are back on. There's one in almost every match.",0
"Was a lot of fun on xbox when it first came out, but PC is currently filled with way too many hackers.",0
"50,000 people used to play this.   Now it's a ghost game..",0

"fallen prey to ever Cod game that ages. it's over run with hackers and players who arent there to enjoy the game, but rather to irritate you with over powered wepons, hacks, and rude jokes (involving your mother)",0
The 1939 Invasion of Poland was more balanced than this.,0
"If you actually want to play the game, steer far clear of this. The hackers have ruined it. The free for all spawns are broken, the aimbotters are plentiful, and if you are playing after 8:00 good luck finding any functioning match. If you're looking for a stupidly unbalanced, hacker infested pool of filth, this is the game for you.",0
I joined a team deathmatch 6v6 game on literally the smallest map  everyone was in ghillie suits and using RPGs and gravity was set on low so everyone was a flying sniper rocketman  i came out 10th prestige with everything unlocked  ok its not what I expected for cod 6/10,0
"Spec Ops is great you can play it with your friends and have a lot of fun. Story line is good too.  But Multiplayer is s**t as to this moment I've played it for 2 hours and I already played with 3+ cheaters, I mean I saw the Kill Cam I know that you have hacks, I'm not saying that I'm great at this game but I see that you are tracking me through the walls.  So you CAN live without this game but it is still good, if you don't play multiplayer.  And I'm sorry CoD but for that kind of money you can get a much better game.",0
"Game: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Original Release Date: 12 Nov, 2009 Date of Review: 05 September, 2015 Update Febuary 2016: VAC has now been made useless, where VAC bans do not prevent people from playing.  The Good: - No overcomplications, no future/exo stuff. - Special Ops is kinda decent, and the campaign is alright. - Most guns are fairly balanced. - Config files not encrypted. - Fairly well optimised and decent graphics (by 2009/2010 standards) if you put them up to 'Extra'.  The Bad: - VAC REMOVED, cheaters roam free with no punishments. - Abandoned by developers, no bug fixes/patches. - P2P Networking, no dedicated servers (Unlike every previous CoD), therefore more hackers then any other CoD. - No included DLC, even though the game has been out since 2009, so small community split even futher. - The start of Infinity Ward hating PC gamers. - No mod support (Unlike every previous CoD). - No map editing support (Unlike every previous CoD). - Locked 65 FOV (Unlike every previous CoD). - No developer console access (Unlike every previous CoD). - Have to edit config files to customise commands like max FPS. - High cost, few sales. £37.99 for the game and all DLC, 6 years after release. - Literally a killstreak that ends the match.",0
"If you liked Call of Duty MW, then you will be disappointed. They completely ruined the awesome server system they had in the first MW and replaced it with this IWNet bs that doesn't let you choose the server you wanna join. Because of that it has become a paradise for cheaters, hackers and all sorts of rubbish. Combine that with the gameplay that has been more optimized for campers and snipers than ever before. Some of the perks and killstreaks you can acheive with camping are so overpowered that it ruins the whole experience. The single-players is just as good as the other COD games, but I bought it mostly for the multiplayer, so I would say it was a complete waste of money.",0
Nice game but too many hackers,0
Worst multiplayer I've ever played.,0
Decent game totally ruined by uncontrolled hacking.,0
"Now, Dont get me wrong. Modern Warfare 2 is a good game. But nowadays, you get nothing but hackers who get in lobbys on public and gives everyone a prestiege master hack or unlock all weapons. I would DEFFIENTLY play this game over Modern Warfare 3. And that's saying something. That Infinity Ward needs to stop making Call of Duty games in general. (Seriouisly, Ghosts is NOT worth it.)",0
"there are enough players still around im mw2 but the game itself is an absolute copy and paste from call of duty 4. the fanbase is one of the worst i have ever seen and they will shout at you for being more skilled than them. it is not fun at all with all these horrible people playing this game. call of duty is very well known for the horrible players. the gameplay is absolutely nothing new and is getting extremely dull these days. you are trapped inside a tiny area with a few other idiots calling each other f@gs, and being attacked by the other team which are also calling you and their own teammates f@gs.",0
"I loved this game on consoles and PC in the beginning, sadly the multiplayer is now infested with hackers no matter what lobby you go to, simply put. Its a waste of money. The community is now miniscule at best due to the staggering amount of cheaters. Do not buy,",0
"The game WAS good, but i was kinda late with buying it (bought it yesterday). It was a lot better in the past, now you don't even have servers to join, just a matchfinding system. The graphic style is ugly (i'm not talking about the quality, i'm talking about the too much brown colour in the game). And, i don't like Infinity Ward's CoD, i'm more the Treyarch guy. Imma buy BO3 when it comes. As i said this game was better b4. Don't buy it now, cause you are 3 or 2 yrs late",0
"10/10 would get modded by hackers and get 5 trojan viruses again   AVG detected 5 files within the Modern Warfare 2 files that were trojans.  will now uninstall this piece of ♥♥♥♥.  To be honest, MW2 isn't a bad game but the VACT (get it? VACT instead of fact) that there is no more VAC makes the game unsafe for literally anyone. Hackers are abundant and virus transfers are too. Stay away until VAC comes back.",0
Get the game only if you want to play singleplayer and/or spec ops. I DO NOT recommend playing multiplayer beacuse there are hackers who use improved cheats which can cause VAC bans to non-cheating players on the server.,0
♥♥♥♥ game got banned for aimbotting? wtf is that ?,0
"Despite Infinity Ward selling DLC in all their games, microtransactions in their most recent game, almost never having to pay for server hosting, making more than most other game developers from tremendous sales... despite all of that, they don't spend the money on upkeeping their old games.  It's unbelievable that they drop support for a game once the next one is out, and the PC is always the last priority for them. There is still a ton of life in this game...or even COD4, but Infinity Ward doesn't even look twice at them anymore. Both games are plagued with a LOT of cheaters online. It's almost as if the game has become like a 'Thieve's Landing' type of place... a place where all cheaters get together because they know there's no law enforcement there. Cheaters cheating against other cheaters. It really is something that has to be seen to be believed.",0
When i got this game it was great and cool. Over time though there has become a course of hackers and less population. I guess its time to let the good old days die...,0
Just too many hackers in Online multiplayer.,0
Why the ♥♥♥♥ are all your games $60 forever.,0

"Probably one of my favourite Call of Duty Multiplayer games of all time. Now is unplayable because the main servers are shut down and to play you need to patch it (illegally) and play on cracked russian servers riddled with hackers and cheaters. Was good, now not. Stay away.",0

"Before I start I must explain that the reason I do not recommend this game is not because it is bad in any way, it is because its multiplayer is full of hackers/mods/spam and broken equipment (it also has no developer support).   The game is however very good, the single player has a gripping storyline that is full of action and great cinematic cut scenes. It includes a variety of wepons and settings so that each level is interesting, one level could take place in a desert and the next in a forest. There are intense moments and plot twists that really do get your emotions going, it's possibly one of my favourite story modes of all time. However it's slightly short and on veteran difficulty certain levels can be near impossible without touches of luck.  Single player also comes with 'spec ops' (which can be played co-operatively), spec ops adds another layer of difficulty to the story mode and alters story mode levels to suit a different challenge. It's divided up into a variety of categories including races so the diversity is enough to keep you playing when one type of mission is frustrating you. The frustration is worth it however as when difficult spec ops are completed you feel extremely satisfied.   Overall I would say it is a great game however its lack of developer support and its toxic hacking environment (online) mean it cannot be worth its price tag.",0
"Short, though intensive SP campaing with over accurate enemies and useless team mates.",0
No dedicated servers and hackers basically ruined this game...,0
"Hacked lobbies, script kiddies, noobtubers, commando knifers and an airspace filled with killstreaks. Every single multiplayer lobby is/has at least one of these, and it is bloody annoying.   As for the single player, 5 hours of linear nonesense (Campaign) and an okish co-op mode (Spec Ops) that both pit you against AI of your difficulty choice, with objectives on screen.  If you are looking to pick up an older Call of Duty, just get the first Modern Warfare. Less bs. More enjoyable.",0
"This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It was the first CoD title leading the series into console ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t without dedicated servers, without a good community without anything. It had good potential but it's full of killstreaks and full of ♥♥♥♥. Sadly I have this game in my account. ♥♥♥♥!",0
"This game would easily fall into my top ten of all time. I think this is THE BEST COD ever made, and probably well be made. single player is so damn good. But unfortuantly,the multiplayer is ruined with hackers. The fact that steam claims this game is Valve Anti-Cheat enabled makes me sad, there is no enforment of this wahtsoever. Its really too bad becuase this was one of the best games to play with friends, but until the multiplayer is cleaned up i would not say its worth $21.99",0
"There is a reason why certain people tell other people 'Go play Call of Duty or something'. Now those people may not be the sharpest arrows in the quiver themselves, but they do have a point.

Ok this was a good game until it got hacked.I played 1 match and already recieved prestiege this is not cool fix this or else not funn ,0
The multiplayer is essentually dead. Few players and half are cheaters. Would not reccommend this to anyone for anything aside from the single player (Which is meh as it is),0

"F*ck you!!!!!  I am so full of rage right now it's unreal. I have been a loyal fan of Call of Duty for a very long time even pre my PC days. I have racked up over 700 hours on COD Ghosts and nearly 200 hours on Black Ops 2. At the weekend I randonly recieved a notification mid game during my gameplay in Ghosts to say that I had been permanently banned from online multiplayer. No reason! Just a notice. I have never cheated on a game in my life, I collect games, I achievement hunt and I have a f*cking expensive PC, all of which pretty much cements me being a solid and dedicated gamer. I contacted Activiton and went on the community hum on Steam and all I am told is it's irreversable and they say I have breached one of their t&amp;c's for fair play. What the actual f*ck?? Why would I rack up nearly 1000 hours to then decide to cheat?! Are they F*cking stupid? I think this is absolutely disgusting and I am totally enraged by this because they have given me no explanation whatsoever other than a link to their policy agreement which is total BS. I am so enraged I am now refusing to buy anything from these c*nts ever again. How can someone or a company have the right to do this to a customer, especially when I am a loyal customer and have done nothing wrong at all. I gaurantee it's a group of ♥♥♥♥♥ on here that have complained about me in some way to force a ban on me. I have no VAC ban or nothing and never have had one. I hope those pr*cks at Activition read this and I hope half the f*cking gaming world does becuase this is not acceptable",0
"I've always enjoyed the single player aspect of these games. This one continues where the first Call of Duty left off. The graphics still are decent to this day (2016) and the music can get you in the mood as your shooting down soldiers. The only bad thing is this series rarely, if ever ges on sale. The price for what you get isn't worth it for single player coming in at little then five (5) hours. It's all preference. The mutlplayer component is there but filled with hackers. If you can get it on sale for 14.99 or less I say grab it. Otherwise, your not missing out on anything that has not been done in previous FPS.",0
"Very dissapointed to spend 15 dollars (i think) and find out that the multiplayer is full of cheaters. At Least i can play the campaign but seriously super dissapointed.  I have 12 hours or something like that on the multiplayer. THIS IS THE CAMPAIGN Not the multiplayer. Thats why it says 0.5 hours on it clam down  If you are getting this for the multiplayer, Don't. Its a waste of money. Its full of cheaters and is pretty much dead",0
I hate this game...,0
This one was still OK....,0
Almost every lobby is hacked and really stupid...,0
very bad game,0
"If you like playing with Hackers, then i high recommend this game!",0
got VACd for another person hacking.,0
"Broken piece of garbage. No dedicated servers, player counter is broken, the in-game invite function doesn't even work properly, hackers everywhere, the community for this is dying out. I played for one hour before someone randomly hacked me to lvl 70 and unlocked every gun and attachment upon joining a match. Get this if you want to see a great example of a publisher who doesn't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about PC.",0
"Re-writing my review. As the COD series is on sale right now hopefully some of you will read this before buying MW2. Back when it first came out I gave it a positive review. Unfortuantely, over the years this game has become not only less and less fun, but now, hackerfield. Hackers everywhere. I recently re-installed this game about two months ago to play with some buddies of mine because they were playing. I literally played less than 3 mintues and then uninstalled. Simply because, #1. It was boring. and #2. HACKERS. Oh my gosh. Modded/hacked lobbies and tons of players with hacks, i.e. aimbots, etc. Please, please, please do not buy this game. Save your hard earned money.",0
"I've owned every Call of Duty, except Ghosts, and Advanced Warfare. I have to say, this is where it all went to ♥♥♥♥. With the addition of lobbies only, and ♥♥♥♥ maps, and overall ♥♥♥♥ mechanics, this is the real lemon. This CoD is really what ruined SERIOUS competitive Call of Duty. I spit on the makers of this game.  Made for consoles, on pc, then ported for pc. Absolute ♥♥♥♥.  -100/10 Would never play again.",0
"i have played it until the end(4 hours gameplay) and still dont know about what happend,The story is just unineristing!Usualy i love the story of cod (playerd mw1,mw3,cod bo1/2,ghost) but in this story its hard to know why their doing it,I still dont know why markarov is a good character.then the final it was unlogical and unspectacular.Multiplayer:Only hackers more i dont need to say about it.Specialforces could be good but not with no players. Overall: I wont buy it again if I had a choice.",0
i hate this game now because i can't play TDM or somthing like that,0
"This game is terrible. Game is poorly balanced, hackers are all over the place, and the hosting system is so awful I hated myself for playing it. ",0
i don't play this and contemplate why it's in my library,0
Too many hackers and modded lobbies.,0
Omg where do I begin with this one. My steam has 3 ♥♥♥♥ing vac bans from modded lobby\'s. Never buying a cod on steam again now my profile makes me look like I hack.,0
"Game is good, but unfortunately there are a lot of hackers and therefore receives less than me and the game is already very old and should have all the DLC to be free and not cost much more expensive! for which no one wants to allocate money!",0
Great game. Great multiplayer and campaign. The number of hackers in the multiplayer are like ...urgh.... well basically every third player is a hacker. Also one man army + noob tubes pretty ♥♥♥♥ing annoying but that's the game. If you're getting for multiplayer only don't get this. Even if you only want to play private matches they dont work :(,0
Another sequel in the Call of Duty franchise. Not only is this game now very old it is also the bloody same as every other Call of Duty.Hey atleast they had half the decency and didnt reuse all of it right? The gunplay is unoriginal and the game offers nothing new. The graphics were even then when it came out outdated and poorly textured.I do not in any form recommend this game,0
"I have loved playing this game since I had it on the Xbox 360. However, this version is plagued with hackers, with no real method of action for taking them out (besides a long and laborious external reporting process).   I have never NOT recommended a game across any of my reviews, so this says a lot. Either Activision or Valve need to make this game's online actually accessible. Games without hackers are an extreme rarity, maybe around 5% of actual lobbies. Until then, this game gets a NO RECOMMENDO from me.",0
"For me this is the 2nd best Call of Duty game only to Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare. Sadly I do not recommend you purchase this in 2014. Graphically on my Windows 8.1 machine with GTX760 and 16GB memory the game has serious issues with jumping frames and gives the impression you're experiencing severe lag. (Can't find a fix anywhere!)  Moreover, as you'd probably guess with any Call of Duty game, it's been destroyed by kids who think they're hackers. Having some wannabe hacker remove your rank is not un-common. Fair matches are not impossible to find however you never know who is using a mod or what advantage they have given themselves.   Also be warned there are no leaderboards and only a few of the game modes have any activity. Search and Destroy is completely dead.   It's a shame each Call of Duty game is abandoned by the developers so soon after final release, especially considering how much the gaming community has given them.   (Played 4 hrs on multiplayer)",0
"This game was unfortunately the downfall of CoD. While it fixed many previous inbalances from the first modern warfare, it introduced many new overpowered abilities such as the commando perk and dual wielding shotguns. Not to mention how crazy devs went with killstreaks and even included the game ending tactical nuke. The game is still a bit of fun as it has very satisfying gunplay and can be very intense, but good luck playing some of the more tactical game modes that require teamwork over deathmatch. It also is very easy to get cheap kills that take no skill or for someone to cheaply kill you without really using any skill. The skill cap in general is very low as well seeing as it pretty much an arena shooter with slower and simpler movent, iron sights, and regenerating health.   On top of all of this, this game is a very bad pc port. It lacks basic features that previous pc CoD titles had such as dedicated servers that support up to 64 players. You can also apparently get vac banned for adding a fov slider, a feature that should have already been in the game in the first place  5/10",0
"It's Call of Duty, the worst game series in the world.",0
Too many hackers and modded lobbies.,0
"Due mostly to it's lack of userbase and limited funtionality as a singleplayer game, I'd say to avoid not only Modern Warfare 2, but the Call of Duty franchise (post the third) as a whole.",0
DONT BUY THIS HACKED PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥. 85% You will end up playing with subhumans. No wonder the sales were good when 1 out of 3 had to buy an new copy to cheat. Buy COD4 or World at War. At least there you wont be put into an position where you bend over and take it like a little b1tch.,0

the single player is short. like really short. its alright I supose but I wouldnt buy this game for single player. I'd save my money for something more expansive with a longer more satisfying ending and a better story that makes no real sense.  the multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥. conecting takes way to damn long. and the game is just plauged by hackers.  inshort could be so much better go buy battle field 1 instead.,0

"Ahh Modern Warfare 2, one of my favorite games of all time. but unfortunately it have become a hack fest.  I guess i can talk about the positives about this game before i tell you why i'm giving this a negative review. The things i love about this game, where do i even start. The first thing i can say that i love about this game are the killstreaks. The killstreaks like the nuke changed the whole game and it was so much fun getting the nuke. The other positives are: the guns (AKA intervention), Maps, Perks, campaign, spec ops and everything else. Now let's get into why i'm giving this a negative review.   (This review is only for the PC version, the Console version are still fine and you can get into a hack/modd free lobby easily)   if you are planning on buying this game right now, wait for a Sale. almost every game you join is filled with hackers using god mode and other cheats to ruin the experience for other people trying to have a fun, casual time. But sometimes you might join a lobby where there is no hackers or modders and when you find those type of lobbies the game become so much fun. but you realise that there is a small chance of returning to a good lobby again.  So that's the reason i'm giving this game (ON STEAM) a negative review. the game is almost unplayable with the amounts of hackers and modders ruining the game. So if you are planning on picking this game up on PC you should probably wait untill a sale happens. Or just get the game of Consoles becuse atleast there it's actually playable.  It's wierd giving this game a negative review since i love it so much. But since Infinity ward and activision won't do ♥♥♥♥ to stop the hackers or modders from ruining this game, i'm afriad this game is gonna be full of hackers and modders till the game eventually dies.",0

"What to say about Modern Warfare 2? Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.  Now, you may be asking, 'Why is the multiplayer dead?' The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hickers and children. Hickers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hicker, another five are going to take that persons place.   The game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warfare 1, World at War, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review. Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and 'clean' of hickers and cheaters.  Some examples of hickers in Modern Warfare 2, are people who use:  Wallhickers Aimbots Instant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL Unlocks Hud-Hicking (Yes, it does exist) Instant VAC Ban  The Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in MW2 that are safe.  Please, please, please watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.  I've heard that Search and Destroy games are safe, but the player count is very little in most game types.  If you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small. I wish all of you people luck.  Overall, get it for the spec-ops, and the singleplayer.  Edit: I no longer play MW2. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hicked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.  Stay safe, and play safe...and watch for hickers...  -Cheers  old cod better   0/10 (can I get it any lower??)",0

I JUST GOT ♥♥♥♥ING HACKED SO I CANT PLAY THIS AMAZING GAME WITHOUT RAPID FIRE GRENADES GOD MODE AND INFINITE AMMO. I JUST ♥♥♥♥ING BOUGHT IT,0
"Ok so I have mixed feelings about this one...... I loved everything about CoD up until this game, and as far as the amazing single player experience I think that still stands, but the replayability for me has disappeared with MW2. The removal of dedicated servers, a plague of cheaters and what seems like a much younger (and less mature) demographic of player base, has soured my CoD multiplayer experience for now.   Let's hope it gets better with the upcoming Black Ops.",0
"Too many Hackers...Ruin the game. One hacker gave me hacks, and that is one reason that I got banned from it because some guy gave me hacks while I was in game then reported me for using hacks which I've never used. Now I am VAC banned and can't post a letter so I can't get unvac.",0

"It was a great game in its time, but it has been ruined over the years by the rise of hackers appearing everywhere. I had the game for not even an hour, and I was hacked to level 70. I didnt want that at all, it takes the fun of the multiplayer away from me. Hacked lobbies are too common, and hackers will be found with access to all care packages(unlimited amounts of them), god mode, and unlimited ammo. Now, the story is still great dont get me wrong. But if you came here for the multiplayer I must warn you its not what it used to be. Buy only if you want the story.",0
"Originally, i wrote a positive review. in hindsight, ive since deleted it.  Sure, MW2 is one of the best CoD games ever created, but the game was released in 2009. its now 2014, so the graphics and gameplay are seriously outdated, and there is now zero support from IW. yet Steam still charges the retail $89.99 for the game.  I PAID THAT UPON RELEASE!  there is zero justification to pay this much, especially considering the community has dwindled exponentially, and moved on to MW3, BOPS, Ghosts etc.  even on special at the moment for $49.99 there is still zero justification to pay so much for a game that is so old. honestly? you would be better off buying CoD4 and have the joy of private servers.  it makes me sad to not recommend this game, but with the blatant price gouging by both Steam and Activision, there really isnt a choice. i just hope this review will stop alot of people wasting their hard earned money that will offer a sub-par experience at best.  off the top of my head, i can think of a dozen games that are more worthy of your hard earned $$",0
"Call of Duty games tend to get a lot of hate. I got this one for free with a graphics card a while ago. After having it sit in my library for a few years, I figured I'd play through the single player campaign. This is a review of that.  This game is total garbage.  A nonsensical story held together by average shooting mechanics riddled down with tons of red goo on your screen.  Here's a plot summary:  Makarov, a Russian, is bad... apparently. So we go undercover, murder a lot of Russians, get killed, start a war, shoot more Russians, free some guy from jail... who fires an EMP at America, go back to finding the bad Russian guy, get betrayed by our commanding officer for no reason, murder tons of Americans and Russians, talk to Russian bad guy who helps us, and then kill a bunch more Americans, then have a stupid knife fight ending with the commanding officer who tells you that he did it basically 'so people enlist in the military'. Roll credits.  I feel like this should all be an elaborate ruse, but I'm pretty sure it's not. Sad.   ",0

The story is ok, I think it's good, but since the PC port is so bad i cant enjoy it. This game is nothing new though, its still the same game when it comes to multiplayer etc. just with a few new weapons and maps. I would not recomend this on PC, buy it on console since iCOD:MW2 runs much more smooth on them.",0

"After the awesome first Modern Warfare the series just got ♥♥♥♥ed up. The beginning of that made MW2.  Story sucks compared to MW1. Where MW1 tried to create a 'authentic' atmosphere, MW2 is just unrealistic and ridiculous. It had its moment though. The gameplay is mostly ok; there is not much evolution, but with some interesting, but infrequent, levels which give you the choice of how to act. The SP is worth a try, even though it isn't as good as MW1.  What totally ♥♥♥♥s it up is the MP. MW1 was basically good, but had some issues. Instead of fixing those, Activision deceided to screw the game totally. Here are some reasons. If you are a fan of MW2, please do me a favour, and explain how you can enjoy the game with such problems.  -Way too small maps for the amount of players. Cluster♥♥♥♥ all day long. -Complemented with a stupid spawnsystem.  -Matchmaking, no dedicated servers. -Killstreaks. ♥♥♥♥ sake, I don't get it. How can people enjoy it, getting instantly ♥♥♥♥♥ 6 or 7 times in a row by a guy in a OP Apache in a game which is all about CQB? -Stupid perk system. Why the hell is there a perk which increases your bullet-damage?! -Zero weapon balance. G18, enough said. -Hitdetection and hitboxes. Watching killcames in this game makes me sick.  -And last but not least a totally immature community which is screaming 'ANAL' in voicechat almost the whole time.   I don't understand how this game can be so popular. I also don't understand why Activision decided to kill the franchise and create the CoD disease we have today. Get MW2 for the SP or the COOP. The only way you can have fun with the MP is in a private lobby with 3 of your friends, disabled killstreaks and some rules.",0
"I removed the game from my steam account for all times. (my soul is clean) Singleplayer is too scripted and brainless. Multiplayer is good but thats not enough for a +review IF you want to play a good fps..buy a Wolfenstein, Medal of honor, Quake or DOOM.",0
"The single player doesn't even start without crashing, and I have been trying. A lot.  Even in safe mode, the game crashes instantly, and trying to tamper the compatibility settings prompts a 'Steam must be running' error. It's a half-assedly ported abandoned mess that is going to be lost in time and only pirates will be able to play it in the future.",0
This game use to be good until the hackers came along which IW don't do diddly squat,0
Really good game so realistic besides the fact it bans you for hacking,0
"rubbish steam effort with no controller support as per usual , and they don't make it clear before purchase !!!!!",0
Meh. I've grown up.,0
"I bought this game because years ago I loved it. It's a great shooter, a real classic of the genre. But, there is a really big problem. The PC version has very few people online and the system for joining games is a joke. Joining my second lobby, the game refused to load the game and it contiuned to do this. As a result I am refunding it.  WARNING TO DLC BUYERS: There are very few games with DLC online and it's a waste having it.",0
THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING FULL OF NOOBS THAT PLAY NOOBTUBE AND ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ THIS IM ♥♥♥♥ING MAD THIS SUCKS I CANT PRACTISE MY FAZE CLAN VIDEO BECAUSE OF THOSE ♥♥♥♥ING NOOBTUBERS ♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥ IM ♥♥♥♥ING MAD OMG REMOVE THIS GAME EVERYONE HATES IT U GOT NO FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"I have a permanent VAC ban on my record because of this game and its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cheat detection. I unknowingly joined one of the many rampant hacked lobbies that the all of the hackers were creating, was instantly max level and had everything unlocked, and then was subsequently banned. Good job Valve...how bout you improve VAC and do something about the real hackers in these games?  Would be 9/10 bomb nuggets, but the hackers and faulty VAC detection make this stank, festering pile of elephant feces a 0/10.",0
"Lacks a server browser, the main reason to buy a CoD game is the multiplayer, and unless you can coarse a group of friends to buy it, you likely won't have a good time. and it lacks the simple things that most shooters on PC have, like FOV sliders and it has an FPS cap.   The campaign is over the top crap, written by a man with a 5 minute attention span. It desperately tries to grab at some open links to the first Modern Warfare, and although the campaign is big on spectacle, it lacks everywhere else, minus Burger Town, which is sort of this games Volga River/D-Day landing.  A terrible port, it runs well but lacks so many features that any decent PC shooter released in 2009 should have. A terrible entry that started a general downward spiral for a great series. Buy Black Ops 1 or CoD: 4, or one of the original Infinity Ward games instead, those are much better.  Also, it gave me a VAC ban. ♥♥♥♥ off! Worst purchase I've made on my Steam account, at least Ride to Hell Retribution didn't stick me with a warning label.",0
Just don't do the mistake what i do because the game it's full of hackers and btw if u will place a hack noane will ban u because it's just full of those wores.It's a good game but full of hackers.This game need a bit more cheat protection because it's easy to place a hack invisible to vac u just can domnate de FFA.I just got a hacker in l00by and he dosen't care about vac bans he sayed: -I play this game whit hacks like 6 months and noane catch me. Now seriously if this game will get a better anti-cheat sisteam i will just play every day.,0
the call of duds is bad lelelelelelel,0
Game sucks ♥♥♥ don't play.,0
WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DID YOU ENABLE VAC BAN NOW THERE IS NO SERVERS WTF,0
Still no favela retured for the PC players and VAC was removed because so few players playing the game. In reality everyone is at liberation mods which allow custom servers (including favela)   I would love to rate up this piece of legend but it's not worth it anymore.,0
was fun playing this game some years ago... now it's dead  TDM is kinda fun if you like playing it and if you find a game that isn't hacked and/or Domination  Search and Destroy is totally dead. You almost only find games with quickscope ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s kicking you if you play normal -.-  that one DLC I got has 2 maps I actually like but when activating the DLC you find less games (sometimes not even a single one)  do I recommend this game? nope will you buy it anyway because it's CoD? of course  the quickscoping kiddies got butthurt and disliked the review xD   the spec ops missions are kinda cool,0
"As of now (I'm sure it's not as of now, now) the game is pretty much worthless to play. Hackers everywhere and it's just simply not worth the hassle to find a server without hackers. It was a great game back in the day but if you want a CoD either buy BOII or any of the more recent CoDs, whichever you prefer.",0
"Not into the CoD franchise, 5 oppy guns in every game that everyone uses, quick scope ♥♥♥♥ like someone can do irl, and full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 8 years old. And yeah, i do play battlefield, 10 times over this ♥♥♥♥ community (not that there arent ♥♥♥♥♥♥s there..) ",0
"If I had written this review 5 years ago, it would've been a Yes. Now, however, I do not recommend this game.  MW2 was great for a while. It had awesome sounds, awesome gameplay, awesome guns, sweet killstreaks, really it was just a great ♥♥♥♥ing game. Of course, people exploit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like noobtubes and commando, and people have gotten too obsessed with sniping. I join a game to ♥♥♥♥ing sit in the back and hardscope like snipers do, not quickscope.  Now it's just hacked to ♥♥♥♥. The chances of actually finding a legitimate lobby are lower than the chances of you getting a life. R.I.P. in peace C.O.D.",0
"Its really bad, you know its bad but you didn't know its *this* bad, its so awful. nothing about it makes sense, the story makes no sense, the writing makes no sense, the general gameplay makes no sense. the gameplay is bad even for a call of duty game, its the most obnoxious first person shooter I have ever played in my entire life.  Do you know that scene in dumb and dumber where they have the most annoying sound in the world? basically that but for like six hours.",0
"Joins Team Deathmatch, gets in modded lobby, hackers put files in your MW2 directory, get VAC Ban on MW2, quit MW2, start playing CS:GO, Gets VAC Ban in CS:GO, Gets VAC Ban in CS:Source. ♥♥♥♥ this game.",0
this game is... was a legend but now you cant play because on every single server there are cheaters or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ trickshotters lobbies and they kick you every time you are close to win.  ,0

Got VAC banned from the game for something I didn't do. I am not pleased. I owned that game for years.,0

"Personal rating: 5/10 Replayability: Low Budget: If it's on sale and you like the franchise, buy it.  Lenght: Half a day.   Modern Warfare 2 takes everything that was good about Modern Warfare 1 and Black Ops 1 and slowly starts decomposing it.   Modern Warfare 1 and Black Ops 1 are both interesting games because of the story, but this half-♥♥♥♥♥ attempt to continue a story that really just isn't interesting or captivating anymore, is just... Tiring.   The gameplay hasn't changed, the graphics might be a little better, but in a game like this, you don't really have time to stop and admire the scenery anyway.   The game is extremely linear and you're left with a constant feeling of frustration from not being allowed to make any decisions ever, and basically being treated like a side-character in someone else's story.   If you've ever played pen&amp;paper roleplaying games, this is how it feels to play with a game-master who loves his own NPC's more than he cares to provide a good game experience for his players.   That said, if you can get it very cheap, it's moderately entertaining.",0
"I don't recommend this game unless you're looking for a short single player campaign and some ALONE coop fun. However the multiplayer and coop parts are totally broken, in MP almost every lobby seems to be hacked or modified in any way and playing this game over LAN is merely impossible due to the matchmaking system and the always online 'Feature' of the Multiplayer. Coop is also very complicated since you have to open ports on your router to sucessfully host a game, same goes for the Multiplayer part. Furthermore Activision and Infinity Ward don't give the slightest bit of support anymore and new hacks and other tools aren't recognized by VAC.",0
0/10 - Cod speaks for itself.,0
"♥♥♥♥ game, uttrer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, full of hackers. Don't waste your money. Please fix",0
"Got banned, not cool",0
"Got this game when I bought my new laptop in order to bring back good memories. However, as expected there's only small community of players left meaning that there are mainly only games in TDM,S&amp;D,HC-TDM &amp; FFA. In these games modes there are often hacked servers, low gravity, prestige, wall hacks amongst the other classics.",0
"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 in itself is not really a bad shooter. It can be quite fun at times, but it's shortcomings are plenty and I would advise you purchase CoD 4: Modern Warfare instead.  The biggest problem this game has is the way servers are found. It has a 'matchmaking' system that forces you to join servers you know nothing about, which are then hosted by a random player in the game. See the problem? Due to this, prepare for wonderful amounts of lag in every game, and in case a player forced to host the server leaves, you have to wait for 30-60 seconds for the server to migrate host to another random player(in the middle of the match). Add to this the fact that you can't pick which settings on a server you prefer, be ready for things like people jumping 50m up and server playing slow-mo or being forced to spin 360 degrees for every bullet you fire.  Another problem are the hackers. Playing this game with a wallhack seems to be a must for most players, as every enemy knows where you are at any moment and will shoot you through walls without you moving an inch, throw grenades at your face or kill you before they even come around the corner(that one might just be the wonderful lag I'm talking about).  Also, the game has a big issue with large monitors. Despite having resolution set to that of my monitor, when aiming down the sight the mouse will move for 5-10 pixels for each 1 pixel it moves when I move my mouse on my desktop, making precision aiming impossible and forcing close quarter combat. Maps themselves also force this, as most of them are made to suit close combat, and you can forget about any sort of tactics, as they are made in a way where you're forced to go down a 'corridor'(whether it's a street, tunnel, building) and the enemy can come only from in front of you, or behind you.  Game modes offered are plenty, but dead. As the game works on forced matchmaking system, you can choose between TDM, DM, Hardcore TDM and S&amp;D. TDM, however, usually contains 80% of the player base, which is around 500 players online normal times.  The game falls short of it predecessor in almost every aspect. Avoid my mistake, as now I'm angry I wasted 12.49€ on this instead of buying CoD4: MW as I originally planned.",0
"So this review is about a refund.  i bought this game a few months back and expected to get a fun delightful game and then i log on... people flying around rainbow camos, aimbot, rapid fire snipers, and ect. so i politley ask if i can have the full $20 back",0

And they removed the absolute best map of any first person shooters (my favorite): favela.  I actually bought this on steam only to be able to play in that map in multiplayer again, and to my enormous disappointment found out they removed it YEARS ago because of some misplaced potentially religion-offending content and never patched it back.  Game has potential, still the most fun CoD, but the devs made very poor choices and basically showed the consumers their middle finger.",0

"This is a good game, BUT, it does not work as there are many bugs and glitches, the game corrupts easily, and so is unable to be used. Love the game but hate the hackers, cheaters and corruptions. I do not recommend this game if you don't like hackers and wasting your money.",0
"So I bought the game, installed multiplayer, and started playing. The first game, I was in a hacked lobby. I was a little bit discouraged, but then, I joined another game, and GUESS WHAT? IT WAS HACKED. I was very frustrated and left the game. I noticed that I was level 70 thanks to hackers. Overall, if you want a modded lobby 99999999/10 games, by all means this game is for you!",0
"well it is 'playable' but I wouldn't recommend this actually.  Just played mw2. Here's what happened.  I invited my friend to play Team Deathmatch together. out of nowhere we're playing Domination. First we said, dafuq?! after that, 2/3 times 'Host ended game' In our team everyone was under level 20 and in enemy team everyone was almost max prestige. Sooooooooooo there's sum ting wong atm.  If you want to play this game, play it on console. Because this game is just a bad port. ",0

And even if those hackers get VAC banned, they can still play and cheat like they were never banned.",0
Best Way to avoid VAC ban is...... Delete this game Don't try to play multiplayer  Hacker are everywhere Also If you aren't using hack But If there was hacker or modder in lobby . Well that mean  Every Players in lobby can get VAC. Activision can banned you without reason Some how DON'T PLAY THIS SH*T Great Story Great Co-op Multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥ thing 0/10  Play Battlefield is the best way because EA has good anti-cheat system No random Ban  Better than Activision is Banned people without reason Random Ban [ Mostly People get random banned ] OH last thing I want to talk.The realistic is IN REAL LIFE DON'T SAID VIDEO GAMES ARE REALISTIC ! Hey Kids stop saying video games are realistic.  Because Your skinny body can't handle real gun[Even pistol]. Aimming weapon is harded than video game  NOW SHUT OFF YOU COMPUTER . GO OUTSIDE AND JOIN THE ♥♥♥♥♥ ARMY MARINE OR ANY ELSE ABOUT MILITARY ! IF YOU WANTED TO KNOW HOW TO REALISTIC YOU SH*TTY! ,0
For a game to not take serously and just be a ♥♥♥♥ being a noob its quite fun. If you are planning to take it serous i wouldn't recommend this game at this period of time do to the fact of the mass amount of nerds in the game makes it hard to begin as well as the high chance of getting a hacker in the lobby using aimbot or some crap like that. Other than that the killstreaks seem too extreme and that it is pretty easy to get spawned killed. So If you don't give a crap and your playing with a friend and you want to make a some 10 year old no life nerd rage bc you ruin their killstreak by noobtubing then this is the game for you.,0

It fulfills its purpose of teachingthe player the controls well enough to play the multiplayer.  The multiplayer is fun in theory, but several problems get in the way in practice.  No dedictated servers ensure near constant momentary lag.   The player base is not very mature, and there is a good number of cheaters.  The unbalanced perk system permits EXTREMELY unfair advantage.  There is no votekick option.  Waiting time in the lobby is quite long as there are many players who purchased the hilariously overpriced DLC map packs that you most likely do not have. The only way to get around this is to pay 90USD for a title that already has a sequel, which has only served to lower the player population.   If you really like the gameplay style, get Black Ops for the console.",0

When you want to play some TDM, 25% of the time you will be placed in a hacked lobby and promoted to 10th prestige without your permission (Happened to me).

Do not get. Everyone will be better than you even if your using the same gun and attachments. Its not worth getting when you die way way more than you kill.,0
"3/10 Sucks. Joined a lobby, I had no way of knowing that it was hacked until a mod menu popped up. It put me to lvl 70 and unlocked everything. This ruined the game. I have never experienced a hacker before today.",0
wtf i whas using a mod but it say's i cheated wtf steam unban me now,0
since modern warfare 3 got released the servers will prolly be empty and I mean EMPTY. don't buy,0

it was a meg alright game not one for fps,0
"You'll get into a lobby with some kids who has mods and he'll get you to level 70 and unlock everything for you. (literally) Next thing you know you're VAC banned, and it's permanent. Fine, fine.

Only Team-Deathmatch mode works... !! Why other are not working? The game tries to connect but doesn't join any game!,0

do not use it on mac when you download it goes to a black screen,0
i bought the game not from steam but from walmart it said it cant run on my 64 bit but thats what i own its slow and lags ,0
"-No lifes COD -Gets into Modded Lobby -Gets Vac banned  -Comes back 1,884 days later to write review  - 1/10 would not play again",0
its multiplayer lets hackers in and i dont like some of its maps,0
I love the game and played endless hours on my XBOX 360 and then on PC... until I got VAC banned for a modder leveling everyone up without choice in a TDM lobby to get the banned. Otherwise i'd give it 10/10.,0
"If you're this late into buying this game, you should've bought it while it was still gold; too many hackers in games, just spinbotting with snipers. This game is still great and all, but tbh, it's just dead now and not worth your money. Just save for a sale on this game or buy another game. Buy Zero G Arena maybe.",0
"just bouight this game last week for $20.00 . Story mode is awesome and whatnot but if you are looking for online competition, this game is the worst. No one is really online and when you find a server, it is supper laggy or a host is switching like every 3 minutes",0
Cheater war....game not supported anymore... RIP COD!,0
This would still be a awsome game if it wasn't for the wall hacks that are still going on here,0
"I had tons of fun with this game at one point, as you can probably tell by my hours played in Multiplayer. There's no denying it's quite a fun game, well, was a fun game.   In it's current state (referring to the online) it isn't worth buying. There aren't as many people playing anymore, and you'll probably get caught up in the same two or three lobbies, half of which are modded.   By the off chance you land yourself in a fresh lobby with no hackers, then you'll still have to deal with an FOV locked at 65, which for many people is just absurd. (You can find a third party launcher than changes the FOV without getting banned by IW, that's what I used for a while).   At one point this game was teeming with competative, fair players. It used to be one of the only COD games, besides CoD4, with a decent community. Unfortunately, the game now houses boatloads of hackers, modded lobbies, and little incentive to keep playing.  Anyway, great game if you have the patience to ignore these major flaws, but I cannot recommend it anymore in it's current state.",0
"I am upset with this game because of the matchmaking system. It automatically searches for players in your area, and since there was not many i couldn't hardly get into a game, so me and my 2 other friends would just play private matches. However you cannot level up doing this and 1 of my friends was the highest level so he had all the guns me and my other friend didn't have. This felt unfair since we couldn't level up, therefore we decided to download some hacks just so we could actually level ourselves up quickly. We didn't hack agaist other players so we didn't ruin anyone else's experience, we just wanted to be able to enjoy the game that we payed for. However, we ended up getting VAC banned for this. I do not believe this was a fair ban but whatever. Now I can no longer even play the game. What garbage.",0

Would be difficult to allow mods and add ons since most of kids cheat anyway?  The fact that this game still costs 20 buck is the proof that money is all what they seek. The only reason worth playing this game are the maps, which are quite good, and the men is simple, but there are far better and cheaper games out there.",0

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway",0

Welcome to Call Of Duty: Hacker Warefare 2,0
THAT WAS COOL,0
spawncamps. its a good game tho. i would give it a meh.,0
Definitely one of the better Call of Duty singleplayer stories out there. It will definitely keep you entertained for the duration of its' mostly four hour campaign.  BUT  Multiplayer doesn't work on Mac. It just...crashed...or goes int oa black screen only restarting your computer can remove. Definitely broken in the multiplayer aspect.,0
"Just don't buy this game,its a waste of money,i am really sorry i bought it just because of the hackers and i lost all my attachements on a server and a hacker dominated the server,i watched the killcam and he was using aimbot:( i am really sorry for this game,it was the best game i had played but it doesn't worth the money,i would take my money back if i can!",0
"The game is good and all, but there are so many hackers it wrecks it. A couple of times I've joined a server and they are hacked servers where I get forced up to level 70 and finishes all the challenges. So for the hackers I can't recommend this game but the campaign is fun.",0
"The single player story is awesome. It picked up where Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare left off. With the 2-player co-op mode, you get to play with your friend to complete missions. Multiplayer contains more choice of killstreak. From remote-controlled missile to 10-second nuclear strike, multiplayer has been more fun than the previous game.  The multiplayer, however, isn't that great. It has poor matchmaking system and also doesn't have a game browser. The lag can be quite troublesome. The ping is stated as bars instead of approximate number. Hackers is the biggest problem of all. They can unlock every killstreaks, challenges, weapons, and attachments for you. This is a problem in the future gaming community because it will just lose players and Infinity Ward may stop supporting the multiplayer game in the future.  I rated this as negative because the multiplayer which is what making the game fun is badly implemented. It would be more stable if there are dedicated servers for rent to continue the fun match while maintaining a good connection quality.",0
"Excellent game love it. But was only able to play this game a short while then was banned by VAC for no reason. When i asked steam why they said that VAC detected a cheat. I have never cheated in a game and mill kill to death ratio in this game should back up my story but steam thinks that their VAC program is perfect and this does not happen, so who am to defend myself against a company who is in complete contol of your games. So its no use me trying to defend my case. Its a great game otherwise, and i hope that no-one else has had the same trouble i had. I have heard of this happening to others and they had their ban lifted, but why hasnt mine, especially if this is the only game in my list that has a VAC ban on it. Makes sense doesnt!? Godd luck to anyone else who own this.",0
"Terrible. The story line is weak and short. Multiplayer? LOL Yeah the biggest fail ever. NO dedicated servers, NO kicking/banning, NO choice in what map you play or any other options OTHER then gametype, NO leaning, unbalanced weapons/perks/killstreaks, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ respawns on overly busy map designs that leads to always being shot in the back by someone respawning or being killed by a camper, cheaters run rampant and are blatant because there is NOTHING you can do about them. Oh maybe VAC will detect the PUBLIC hacks, and ban them a few weeks later...maybe. It just keeps being worse. Lack of a console to tweak settings or even to display your frames per second!!!! Laggy as f*ck, as expected with no dedicated servers. Also what would appear to me, having their employees or simply people they pay to blatantly lie saying how good the game is. All of this for $10 more then PC games go for.....what a rip off.",0
91 FPS cap and no ability to unlock via console like Black Ops. This game should be running at 200 FPS no problem. Why bother putting a 120hz graphics setting if you're going to cap at 91?,0
alot of people cheat from lvl 1 to 70 (i have and i gave alot of videos and screenshots to steam and VAC but they don't care) and they ban who they want........,0

Call of duty: Hacker warfare XDDDD,0
"Call of duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoD MW2) is the game that ruined Call of Duty Franchise.   Let's start with singleplayer. Singleplayer and escpecially Co-op missions were still somewhat ok, but singleplayer also had many things that I didn't like. First of all the singleplayer was filled with too many cutscenes. At least I play games to play them and not to watch movies. Of course the plot is important, but too much of cutscenes is just too much.   Another problem was that the plot was just too ridiculous. This is connected in many ways with with the third problem. The thing that I really liked in previous Call of Duty games and especially in the first Call of Duty game was the feeling of fighting with other soldiers (unlike in most early FPS games, in which you are a lone wolf) or how it was said in the cover of the manual of the very first Call of Duty game: 'No one fights alone'. This no longer applies in CoD MW 2 and the games following it. In CoD MW 2 you no longer fight with large group of fellow soldiers. Instead you fight alone or with only a couple of guys at most.  Now to multiplayer, which was the real disappointment. In the first Call of Duty game the maps were larger and more open but for some ridiculous reason the maps kept getting smaller and had more and more bottle necks as the series progressed. I could somehow cope with that until this game and i might have coped with it still if it had been the only problem, but it wasn't. The main problem that I have with this game are its ridiculous killstreak rewards and killstreak requirements. In CoD 4 the killstreaks were still somewhat acceptable, but CoD MW2 is no longer an FPS game. It is a game of killstreaks rewards. That is just not fun. The CoD games after this one have continued the usage of ridiculous killstreak rewards and because of this I will probably never again buy Call of Duty games. (To be honest, I predicted that this game was going to be horrible, and as a result I didn't buy this game, but instead got it as a gift.) Multiplayer part of MW 2 also suffers from decision to not to have dedicated servers.  Grade for Singleplayer: 6/10 Grade for Multiplayer: 2/10  Edited 26 Nov ember 10:29 to correct annoying typo. Edited to change 'the maps were large and open' to the maps were larger and more open' Edited 14 January 23:26 to fix a minor typo. Edited 18 February 21:03 Lack of dedicated servers added.",0

This game got me a VAC ban on another account. The ban was wrongly placed; this was admitted by Steam and I got TF2 for it as compensation. The VAC ban is still visible though...  The game is not worth the money; The original MW is better...,0

"Grr.  Ok, functionally this game is excellent. Lots of guns to shoot and lots of things to shoot at. However, the improvements made to these areas come at the price of the story and variety that CoD4 had. The result is a cheesy 'cold war goes hot' story where the Ruskies invade America that is just not very well done (if you want a good story in that setting, go check out the game World in Conflict). And while there is some of the sneaky funtimes of CoD4 that balanced that game against the intense firefights, this game is almost entirely big firefights. Make up a list of every thing you would expect to see in your typical hollywood action movie, and chances are quite alot of what's on that list is somewhere in this game. This is the sequel CoD4 got, but not the one it deserved.  Oh yeah, and multiplayer's here too. I actually did try that out in this game a bit, but after a while I stopped due to a mix of being terrible at its high-pace and annoyance at having few to no chances to try out the Spec Ops co-op missions which were actually kinda cool.  If the only thing that means anything to you is shooting guns in games and explosions, then you can have fun here. But if you like story to go with it, then this game will dissapoint.",0
Im sorry to say that this whole franchise died after CoD4:ModernWarfare. That edition was as classic as CounterStrike.  Yet they wanted to milk their gamers further.. and further.. and further and here we are 2013 around 6 games later..   No soul left in these games anymore.,0

"This used to be a great game but now it got old. Multiplayer is dead-empty, and even if you manage to connect to a full-populated match, 20% of players are cheaters or noobsters with G18 akimbo.  In short, dont buy this. Used to be a good game but it's worthless now.",0
"one of the worst Military games I ahve played in Multiplayer, the single player is allt hat is worth playing. Internet play is as loggy as they come and there is no Dedicated server, so you are relying on a Host that is probably infested with Spyware from the Giant Google Partners. Stay away from this POS game, because you knwo after you get threw single player your stick with ♥♥♥♥. Stick to Modern WarFare it's better, and So that you ♥♥♥♥ers know, CoD is on the Death Bed, and the Development teams are considerign the Suspenion of future releases.

"This game is bad. Very bad. All my pretentious friends told me so, all my normal friends told me so, but with a metacritic score of 86, how bad could it be? I thought while ominous music played in the background.  Pros: - spunkgargleweewee if you're into that sort of thing - burly white dudes kill other people with large guns that have military sounding names  Cons: - frustrating - levels feel all the same - the person you're following always moves too slow - F***ING GRENADES EVERYWHERE WHAT THE F**K!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - is everyone in this game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? - will make you question why you haven't stopped playing yet  That said, it's got good multiplayer.",0

"The worst bug i've ever encountered! Exodus: the laser sensor locks out after you die once making the game impossible to complete as you need that same key to finish the level (changing controls doesn't help either).

"What can I say about Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 2.   Whenever I think of MW2, I think of bliss, I think of flying through the clouds without a care in the world, talking to our lord and saviour jesus.

The amount of cheaters is absolutley ridiculous, it outnumbers the cheaters in CSGO by 300:1, and that is saying something.

"I wish I could rate the online mode some where in the middle because I do have fun from time to time. Unfortunately, I can only recommend a Yes or No. While single player is pretty good, the online experience is extremely tainted with hackers and aimbotters. The worst part is that I do not believe anything is really being done about it. I will admit that I have had fun playing online. But this really only happens if I am able to get enough friends together to start a party. To sum it up, if you plan on playing online, expect this: You will continuously be shot through walls by aimbotters, ruthlessly tracked down by wallhackers, rude players, the occasional dDos from poor sports that can shut your net down for a bit, and you will quickly discover how sexually active your mother actually is (likely within the very first match).",0

"i have not played this one for i was always a fan of world at war and black ops. but this one was said to be the best before the third game. well truth is i can tell it used to be but not now. this game is infected with hackers, aimbots, map hackers, speed hackers, you name it and you can find it. oh did i mention that out of the constant 300+ people there most of them are hackers? ya see i can tell this cause of the severe landslide of 10th prestige level 70 players with prestige emblems/rank emblems you cant get unless you mod or hack or have a hacker give to you. i was level 24 when this happened but i joined a server via random matchmaking que and it put me in a server that was really laggy. then after about a minute a player on the console with a rainbow colored name said ' everyone gets level 70 ' then a loading bar popped up on my screen that looked like it was a campaign hud overlay for a mission done in campaign counting percents. well in my console it was telling me all my challenges were being completed one by one and one after another. i tried to leave the server but it had been too late. the hacker had made my once FAIR level 24 profile a level 70 profile with hacked emblems titles and such. being really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off as i was i refused to play for a day then said 'might as well just try to enjoy the game' well among servers like that and other exploits i was also thrown into countless matches where people were running mods such as changing the team names of navy seals and the spetsnaz to '♥♥♥♥♥' and '♥♥♥♥♥'s' as well as turning off everyones loadouts killstreaks knife button aim button and replaced grenades with throwing knives and forced to no scope with a intervention. then there was another server where one such hacker was calling every single kill streak reward in the game all at once within the first ten seconds of the match. another server i joined changed the map half way through. and to further prove my point. there is a server that someone is running labeled as a team death match server but its a team domination server. the host of such server is running a aimbot with a 50 cal and every time he takes a shot every lags. as well as he has turned off various loudouts and changed what is in them. i dont think this game is bad persay. but it is infested with hackers and Infinity ward and Valve's VAC service that is supposed to maintain the game is doing absolutly nothing about such problems. i would say get this game because its a good game in the series but unfortunately i wouldnt even look in its general direction unless its playing privately with a friend or two. ( if anyone will play it due to call of duty's reputation. i for one have only few people i know who play it on my friends list cause of the fad of people saying cod sucks cause it sucks nonsense) if anyone were to get this game i implore you to not even touch the multiplayer functions unless playing privitely with a friend. other than that this game is dead because of infinity wards abandonment of it as well as the VAC service being proved to be really useless in it.

"Short version: Ok singleplayer for $10. Not recommending cos the normal tag is (at least in AUS) $40 USD. Play time 8hrs 40min on Veteran (frist run)  Long version: Standard shooter. Still not as good as original COD. Stole a lot of it's missions from the original  (e.g. Reichstadt, Stalingrad). Gunning down civilians was a plus.  The difficulty of enemies is lame, brought on by implementing a simple AI that autoaims/wallhacks, funneled scripted moments, and overwhelming number of enemies. Nothing tactical or strategic required.  Weird autosave spots, like right in the middle of a firefight. Then not one for 5 minutes. Visual cues when and where you are getting hit from are poor. Screen shakes a lot for no reason (getting hit, heavy vehicle) Garbage stealth level where you kill one guy silently and suddenyl everyone knows. Unless if your sniper buddy kills him, then that's ok. Spawns enemies right on top of you, in corners where you know there were no enemies.  Can't tell who are the enemy, yet get a game over screen for shooting your buddies No continuity between one level and the next.  Some nice level design - felt that although scenarios were repeated ad infinitum - some of those levels lacked character, while others were detailed. Only allowed to complete everything one way (with a handful out of thousands of potential choices, with zero consequence).  Hold button until it dies works in 95% of cases Your allies do next to nothing unless explicitly scrtiped to do so... might as well be Star Wars Stormtroopers.

I didn't want to play online or anything multiplayer, just a couple minutes in the privacy of my own home. Just because my game didn't have the latest updates was not going to take away any enjoyment for the hour or so I had available to play! I have had it with this crap! I have most of the call of duty games and all of the modern warefare games. I am going to get rid of them all in a yard sale this spring and as God is my witness from now on any game that has anything to do with steam is not coming in my house!

"In most multiplayer games, kids like to adapt what I call the 'naiive driver' attitude, where cars going faster/driving more aggressive than you are crazy, reckless, cop magnets. while cars going slower/driving more passively than you are obviously in no hurry to get anywhere, they must be senior citizens in the driver seat and well the world would be better off without them.  This game is absolutely ridden with children like these. I consider myself a pretty good player (I get some ridiculous KDRs...) but as always, those who are better than you MUST be hacking. Those who are worse than you are ♥♥♥♥ing noobs and need to learn how to play.  In addition to the community complaints, I have a bone to pick with those who consistently use the most overpowered or trolling weapons. People like to justify this with 'its in the game', but this fallacy is overturned when they realize that metaknight is in super smash bros brawl, the moon breaker laser was in Golden Eye, and the 1-hit-KO hadouken upgrade was in megaman X. Just because the programmers of the game wanted to make a few guns easier to use and overall better than others doesn't mean they meant for the grenade launchers and akimbo glocks to be abused all the damn time. Yes they're programmed into the game and if you buy it you'll have to deal with it.  Pros: I liked the single player campaign it was fun. Spec ops are fun too. Cons: Community in multiplayer blows, hackers run amok ♥♥♥♥ing with lobbies and your customized classes and whatnot, some children will whine and cry while others will troll the hell out of u with cheap strategies and annoying classes.  Don't get this game I still play it because I'm good enough to ♥♥♥♥ with everyone. That's about it.",0

Its Ok but 2many hackers,0
"Wont open or run, what gives....",0
"A lot like CoD4.   The campaign is fine, but the multiplayer has hackers, which ruins the game. The multiplayer maps you start out with make poor use of space, and unlike in CoD4, where small maps had room for all ranges of weapons, pretty much everyone in MW2 uses medium range weapons. So less diversity, still hackers, but the game doesn't have all the mods that made CoD4 interesting, plus no admins.  Just not worth it.",0
"It's decent game. I'm still downvoting it, because I think it's unreasonable that they would release a patch that would stop the cheat codes from working in a game that still has some serious flaws. It's the same with MW2, and probably with World at War, too.",0
"1 of the worst game that i have ever seen. So boring, primitive, unlogical. I am talking not only about mw2, but about all game series from CoD4 to ghosts. For example, weapons. It seems that weapons' characteristics were written under tonns of drugs. .50 cal barret has similar damage to 7.62x51 M21 rifle. USP .45 has same damage to 9mm beretta ( 9x19 vs 11.43x25 ). Tavor-21 ( 5.56x45 ), AK ( 7.62x39 ) and SCAR-h (7.62x51) have SAME damage. .50 AE desert eagle has same damage to .44 revolver. WHY every CoD has WA2000 rifle??? only 200 rifles were made and nobody use it. HEY TREYARC! just google ' sniper rifle ' - you will find a lot of sniper rifles which is much better than experimental WA2000. About scenarious - yeah, bad russians and good americans save the world - very fashionable story. Nothing original, nothing interesting - just always make the same. About BO - this is the worst CoD even made. Its just epic fail. 90% of all weapons are FROM FUTURE. Game about 1960's and it has AK74, WA2000 from 1980's (!!!), GP25 and a lot of other things. Of course scenarios are the worst - tell how bad russians used nazi scientists and put heroes of ww2 into the prison. And it doesnt matter that IRL situation was clearly the opposite - americans used nazi scientists. Gameplay is the most primitive, unlogical, unrealistic and boring. All gameplay in 2 words - run n gun. Even Counter-strike is more logical, realistic and interesting than this. Freaking health regeneration - after .50 in stomach just wait several seconds and you are OK.  http://huh.by/uploads/posts/2012-06/1340985650_call-of-duty-vkratce.gif  - about melee fight. And about Ghosts.. dear treyarc, what do you call ' nextgen '? I have never seen so bad graphics, even RO1 and CS:S have better graphics than 'ghosts'. Gameplay is just 100% copypast from other CoDs, this game is still the same as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago, IT IS ABSOLUTELY 100% SAME GAMEPLAY - NOTHING CHANGED.   I think that treyarc just uses the brand, sucks money from blind people. I really wonder that someone still plays it and love it.  The only 1 CoD which i like - is the first CoD. This is the only 1 CoD where you dont have health regen, here you have 100 hp. Yea, its quite unrealistic too, but it is more realistic than auto regen after any wound. Only in first CoD you can place your weapon bi pod. Only in first CoD you can use vehicle NORMALLY, WITHOUT ANY STUPID LAPTOPS.",0

"The game is fun. Unremarkable and short singleplayer. Fun, but mostly abandoned multiplayer. The multiplayer community is split across a number of map packs. The game still costs a lot because activision is seemingly unwilling to discount it to a reasonable amount.  I would only recommend this game at $5.  I will update this review to be more in-depth at a later time.",0

"The classic (and problematic) mechanics of Call of Duty of 'spawn an infinite number of enemies until you go to this waypoint' are in full effect here.

"Used to be a pretty nice game, but not worth buying now as it does not work properly with Windows 7 or newer. Even in compatibility mode it freezes and crashes consistently in single player, so unless you enjoy playing the first few missions of the campaign until it freezes, crashes, and looses all your data and makes you start over, it's a pretty worthless game at this point.",0
"Hello, thanks for reading my review. Hope yall take it into consideration before you buy this game.  Will it ♥♥♥♥ Your Computer: Yes. I'm not kidding. there are endless articles about it online. just go look up 'How to fix MW2.'  1. DO NOT PLAY MULTIPLAYER ON THIS GAME. it will break your computer. it gave me internet problems where i disconnected from my router yet my brothers laptop could connect 100% fine compared to mine. EVEN IF I WASNT PLAYING MW2, IT STILL RANDOMLY DISCONNECTS MY INTERNET FOR NO REASON, AT LEAST ONCE PER 25-30 MINUTES. i had to uninstally and reinstall my internet and ethernet drivers and it STILL did not completely fix the problem, even though it helped a bit.  2. it also broke my computers headset support so my headset that worked 100% perfectly fine before playing the game would not work at all. back to the internet problems, being in a skype or teamspeak call for too long while playing ANY game not just MW2 would also make me lose connection automatically after about a minute.  3. I EXPERIENCED NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE HAVING THIS GAME, AND EVEN AFTER UNINSTALLING IT, NONE OF THE PROBLEMS WERE FIXED. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  4. My brothers friend who is pretty good with Computers says my last alternative will be to freaking uninstall and reinstall windows 10 tomorrow and we will see if that will fix anything.  5. CAMPAIGN WORKS 100% FINE. BUT ONLY BECAUSE THERE IS NO MULTIPLAYER ASPECT.  6. DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. I loved loved loved the xbox version back in the day but i sold my xbox awhile back and wanted to play a little MW2 cause it was an amazing game, but all the issues with it ♥♥♥♥ing with my computer. its such an unstable game holy shhhhittttt do not buy it. It will give your computer cancer.  7. its cheap as ♥♥♥♥ (like 4.50$) on ♥♥♥, which is a very trustworthy site, so thats a good cost if you ONLY want to play the Campaign. otherwise, do not get this game.

"In 2007, CoD:MW (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare) was released into a community that has a seemingly insatiable lust for more shooter action. They weren't just given another shooter, they were given a game that really pushed the genre considerably. Amazing single player campaign and adrenaline-pumped, fast-paced multiplayer action with perks and weapon sets set the new standard on how these FPS's are done. It left it's mark on gaming as a whole, so a sequel was inevitable and gamers couldn't wait. In fact - according to an eye-witness who works at my local Game Stop - MW2 '...became the best-selling game in history before it was even released', all being pre-orders (of course, #1 sellers are subject to change). Imagine their dissapointment when they got this...  Plot 1/10  ..was so convoluted, I can't tell you what it was. Everybody wants everybody dead except the protagonists, and the only solution is...killing everybody. It's a movie written by Michael Bay. That's all I have to say about the plot without spoiling it. If you don't care (which you shouldn't), highlight this big, black box.    You meet Soap in the third-person, but it's so akward and out of his character to hear him talk. Then when you get back to playing as him, he stops talking again. For the main character of the first game being linked into the second game, he's just so seemed; so tacked-on and uninteresting. All the characters from the last game are 'magically' back too, despite being shot in the back of the head with Desert Eagles. Captain Price is back, but his acting and dialogue couldn't be more out of character. He went from rough, clever, and a cold sense of humor, to this...My Little Pony....thing. He's overly polite with no backbone. Imagine Mufasa suddenly with the mentality of Patrick Star, and you're not far off. Further, everytime I hopped onto an escape vehicle, I knew someone was going to shoot me because it happens like 4 times. When General Shepard reveals himself as the bad guy, it wasn't exciting. It was met with a loud YAAAWN. The twist is where the game's story slips into a void like a balloon into a hurricane. The player also 'dies' too much. Not in gameplay, but more like a scripted event/cutscene thing. Once again, *yawn*. The only intriguing part is when the EMP wipes out most of America's power. You and your team navigate a deathly-silent ghost town. It's eerie and very realistic; the best part of the game.    The ending also plays out like every other cutscene in the game: 'Good job, now let's carry you off and tell you who the kill nex-' CREDITS; THAR'LL BE A SEEQUEL!  Graphics/Sound 8/10  I'll put these in the same category because I don't have much to say about them. MW2's sound and visuals are everything we expect from the series: excellent. The guns, the dust, the lighting, character models are all beautiful, and guns, tanks, explosions all sound great, too; so why an 8/10? Attentive gamers will notice that a majority of this game's voice cast is from Mass Effect. In fact, several things were just 'taken' from Mass Effect. For one thing, your CO's voice is the voice of Captain Anderson, and the voice of the general is the voice of Admiral Hackett. Oh, and the general's name? Sheperd. There's nothing wrong with being inspired, but I call this a lazy, rip off. Infinity Ward wasn't even trying. Maybe I'm just being picky, but this really rubbed me wrong despite Keith David's long career as voice actor for military-esque media.  Gameplay 5/10  Finally, gamers are starting to see the light with the release of CoD:Ghosts. It's the same. Darn. Game. Same rail-shooter scenes, same set pieces, same 'set bomb and run away' scene, same door breaching scene, same, same, same. We've been playing the same game since the original Call of Duty in 2003 and before that with the Medal of Honor series. It's been 11 years of the same game. It's time for CoD to die. You run forward, you kill the next thing that moves, and steadily march to the credit roll. Everything about it is so banal; boring to the point of painful. The graphics and sounds aren't enough to mask the bad gameplay and story. A pretty package doesn't make the bad contents good. You've played CoD before. Enough said.  Multiplayer also went downhill with unbalanced weapons and killstreak abilities that broke the game entirely. When you get 3 kills in one life, you get a UAV that reveals all enemies on the radar. However, these streak rewards stacked with one another, so you use the UAV to get a few more kills, and get a chopper. The chopper automatically gets you 5 more kills giving you an AC-130 gunship. Use THAT for a few more kills, you get a nuke that ends the game instantly. Sounds pretty ambitious on pen and paper, but in game it means: first to a 3 kill streak WINS. Hackers also had their way with the game and Infinity Ward/Treyarch/Activision or all three refused to do anything about it. I've heard rumors that the same hacks that worked on MW2 also worked on MW3 and Black Ops. Watching this trend, I believe it.   If you want an example of customer service done RIGHT, let's ask Valve. Some time ago, Steam was glitching up and improperly banning players from accessing MW2. Gabe Newell wrote a personal apology to these gamers, and offered them a free copy of Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2). While that was generous and very polite, that might have been a bad idea for the poor people that play L4D2, because all the teenage @***holes from this game are now trolling the L4D2 community (as if that game wasn't bad enough.)  The Verdict  Visually, there's little to complain about. MW2 is very realistic by sight and by sound. Some of the settings are creepy with ash blotting out the sun and smoke rising from decimated vehicles and climbing corpses to escape combat. The whole world is going crazy, but they couldn't make the player care less. Traversing the beautiful world is an uphill hike to the credits. Yearly releases also means the community will be widely divided and chopped thinner and thinner with each release, so there's no point in trying to play MP. MW2 is big pass. Maybe get it for 5 bucks and beat it once. Final score: 3/10 Almost no reason to buy it.",0

so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad i can go play because ''steam must be running to play this game'' and i cant fix it ♥♥♥ this!!! ,0
"Too many hackers, too many 'instant 70' servers, I really like the game, but at least playing the multiplayer on steam is not recommended at all.",0
"Yes, I loved this game it's awesome! It never gets damn boring! If you're so much into leveling as I am, you're gonna have much time spend on this game! BUT! Here's the ♥♥♥♥ing thing! There's a important reason why I write this TODAY! I've bought this game like one or two months ago! I enoyed it a lot til this day. Because when I joined a match today I stumbled into a hacked lobby, which is actually nothing in usual in cod as you may know, you just gently exit it... But today, I ♥♥♥♥IN GOT BANNED FOR JUST NOTHIN! It is just ♥♥♥♥in rediculous! I did not do one little rule breaking thing, and got punished for the 'crime' of another person! I even tried contacting the the staff, as adviced by steam... And this is what came out:    1 Message by you on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 6:53 As I today started steam and thought about playing a bit Modern Warfare 2 Online, everything was fine. I logged into steam, started the game and finally went into an Team-Deathmatch game. Then i quickly realized, it was a hacked lobby. Since it was some kind of Snipers-Only match. I then turned around and went out again. Then the strange things started. Firstly my name was, for non me known reason, completely dark blue, as if I'd have set it up in my Steam name, those color combinations I mean, which I did not! I thought then 'it might maybe be just an bug...', so I just started to look for another match, another TDM one. But this time, when I'm entered, I immediately got kicked out and left with the message 'Cheat detected.'. I was just shocked! Because I did nothing wrong! I was not hacking at all! I just accidently joined such a lobby! I even asked, before leaving, who was hacking in there. A player with the name 'Progster', or something like that, responded. So I tried another time to play a match and the exact same thing happened. Until that point my name was still blue. I decided to restart the game and see, if it may goes back to the nnormal state. And so it was. My name then turned white (or orange in the menus I mean), but the ban still existed!  So my question is, if you may could reset the ban and instead punish the right perpetrator. I did really nothing wrong and I was so happy when I finally got the game. I just can't believe that I got really banned... All this happened like half an hour ago. So I beg again for resetting this somehow happened ban. This has already happened to me in the past, but I did not got banned for accidently joining an hacked lobby...  Thank you very much. - Message by our staff on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 6:53 If you have been VAC Banned, the ban will not be removed.  For more information, please refer to our FAQs:  https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4044-QDHJ-5691  2 Message by you on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 6:54 But it was really not my fault! I wasn't hacking at all! Is there no possible way of checking this? 3 Message by you on Sun, 22nd Feb 2015 7:05 So this is what I've read in your FAQ: Q: I am a legit player but I am afraid of getting banned?  A: It is extremely unlikely that VAC will make a mistake when banning someone. Even if this occurs you can simply contact Steam Support who will usually lift the ban if it was given wrongly. Again, this is extremely rare.   So please...    Now you see, they wont even keep their word. I don't even think they read what I wrote there! I bet it's just somekind of an auto message! Since it was posted immediately after i posted mine. How rude of them! Im gonna be patient until tomorrow... But still, for everyone who is about to spend money on this, to this day its a pretty high price for the game, keep in my this could happen to you, too!!! ive read through some threads as well. I dont think there is hope for my siuation, since those people never responded with something positive again...",0
"another crap fps, you dont need half brain to play it, just jump around with akimbo shooting everything and you will rule! cheater dominate this game.  can I delete it from my library?",0
There is too meny hacked lobbys on this game. Buy the Mordern Warfare 3 insted. just saying  I playid this game om ps3 for like 300 hours but the pc version is just  :/ bad,0
"Great game, bad anti-cheat. I have only owned this game for about two weeks and have already been VAC banned, for no reason at all. I don't hack in any of the games I play, and never have hacked in any games. I am dissapointed in VAC's anti-cheat, hope I can get unbanned.  Until they can ban players for legit reasons, I will continue to not play and dislike this game.",0
i would realy like it if they added xbox controllars if you do i will recomend and fix the hackers i got banned because i was on a modded server and the hacker gave me a menu and now im vac i would really like it if you un vac banned me please!!!!!!!!!!!! i really love this game!! ,0
"Over-the-top military action, same basic package as Modern Warfare 1 but with prettier graphics and a bit more controversy. As usual, the TF141 segments are not nearly as fun as the Ranger segments, but they are the ones that play the story forward, unfortunately, whereas the Ranger parts feel more like afterthoughts.  Part of the storyline feels completely ripping off Homefront, story is convoluted and hard to follow and rather short. Barely 5 hours of gameplay. Glad I got it for cheaper.  Not even going to bother with the multiplayer...  If it's 15$ or less, not a bad deal. But more than that? Meh...",0
"I'm gonna have to say no. The gameplay and campaign are great, but multiplayer is the single reason I bought the game. Multiplayer is not the best.  Pros:  -Multiplayer is still populated -Optimized (Plays perfect on my GT-610 and i3 550).  -Fast paced gameplay -Good leveling system -Valve Anti-Cheat -No 9 year old cursing trolls, unlike the Xbox version  Cons:  -No community servers -Matchmaking system is out of whack (Look at my profile screenshots for details). -Asking questions in MP is impossible without being called a 'Nub' -Constantly migrating hosts in-game   If this game were maybe $10 instead of $20, I would definetly recommend it, but when the cons are compared to the price, I have to say no. I will still play the game, but will not buy any DLC from it.",0
"I remember how few years back, CODMW2 was released. Some chose to boycott it, others bought it. Some hated it, some loved it. For me personally, having spent few good weeks in a decent COD4 clan, which at its time was a game, where a lot of DFBHD community moved to, I remember CODMW2 being like brick, which destroyed fragile dreams. Suddenly, there were newses about lack of dedicated servers, lack of mods support and suddenly - there was no hope that CODMW2 is ever going to reach heights of COD4 and its community - and if only we were exaggerating it - reality turned out to be even worse. Yes, I'm judging MW2 by the prism of esport gaming - one of my favourite memories were of a time, I spent playing COD4 in clan and then comes MW2 - no mods support meant, no promod. This meant, that all the balancing issues would pop up with high skill esport scene, were never going to be addressed. Lack of dedicated servers meant, there is always going to be at least one person, who can potentially react faster than others. There were DLCs - which at this point in time meant, nobody in esport scene is going to even play these few more maps. And obviously - then there was one of the laziest implementations of VAC, ever. And finally - esport killing FOV, set at ridiculous 65 horizontal degrees. Everything combined, created one laggy mess of a game, full of cheaters, only made worse with near unplayable FOV. It was a mess and luckily esport-wise got nowhere. But even skipping whole esport scene case - casual-wise it wasn't relly that good of a game either. It's just that PC port was so poor, it either made me feel sick due to low FOV... or made me quit, thanks to people shooting using aimbots, wallhacks and a tons of other crap.  Furthermore, at its time, I didn't really like CODMW2 for its singleplayer, either. I remember most of my friends being extremely impressed by its singleplayer campaign, but I found game's heavy hand-holding extremely irritating. If only I knew, this problem is going to infect almost the entire shooter genre... yes, if there is reason for what happened with shooters for the last 4 years - for the existence of atrocities like Aliens: Colonial Marines, Duke Nukem: Forever, Homefront and many others - it's sadly that other developers tried to copy MW2 formula, despite for the fact it does not fit and it would have never fit their games. CODMW2 was pretty much the first military shooter, with such an incredibly scripted singleplayer campaign, where a player is constantly hold by a hand and told what to do and what not to do - where to go. This is where linear shooter ended and scripted shooters started. Admittedly, all credit to MW2 - it still manages to make for some interesting cinematic experience and some action set pieces are really good. It's just a shame, player is so often a viewer of this story instead of a hero.  I'm going to say this - if you don't mind scripting much and being hold by a hand almost the entire game - and if you really want to know how the story develops after COD4 - if you can get MW2 on sale (5€) - you should have a decent fun with it. Don't expect however to play much of a multiplayer - it's essentially dead. For multiplayer - buy good old  Call of Duty 4  or much better PC-wise  Black Ops  or  Black Ops 2 .",0
all it needed was DServers and it would have been great :(  fun while it lasted  ,0
"this game was terrible, i had it for a weekend and during that time there were so many hackers, also you cant pick what server you want to go to, its all automated.",0
Decent multiplayer for sure but I cant recomend this game with the amount of cheaters unfortunately.,0
"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is the main game we point the finger at when we look at the negative aspects of Call of Duty, and rightfully so. Before I delve deeper, I would like to start out by addressing the controversy between Call of Duty and Battlefield. While I do prefer Battlefield, I do NOT despise the COD franchise. I had moderate enjoyment with Call of Duty 4, and a blast with Black Ops 2. However, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is easily my least favorite in the franchise. Without further ado, lets dive in.  What does Modern Warfare 2 do wrong? The first place is the campaign. While the story was decent in the game, it was a big disapointment. To no suprise, it is a linear corridoor shooter, as you mow up enemies and stop evil Russian men. Nothing new here, and there is no motivation to play the campaign. The only REAL motive I can think of is if you took alot of enjoyment in COD 4 campaign, and want to see what happens to your favorite characters in the franchise.   Next we have Spec Ops, which is a spectacular addition to the game. The minigames are superb in this game with great level design, and is a blast with friends. I took alot of enjoyment holding off enemies, mostly due to the replayabilty and freedom of this gamemode, in contrast to the Campaign, which forces you to put rockets on certain targets.   Finally we have the multiplayer, the heart and soul of the game. And let me tell you, is it horrid. This is not because the game is not 'realistic' enough - come on, we are in an arcade shooter. It is because mechanics are bad. Yes, they gel well, and the game doesn't feel clunky, but they are just flat out bad design choices. The first issue is create-a-class, which looks very dynamic at first, but essentially boils down to a handful of gun and attachment combos that are overpowered. This makes gunplay boil down not to skill, reaction time, or map knowledge - but who has the best overpowered gun. Same goes for perks and deathstreaks. I would have much more enjoyment in making a class, and finding a setup that suits my playstyle, in contrast to this game.The game also has no emphasis on teamwork, mostly due in part to killstreaks that cater completely towards racking up more kills. Not to mention, hacking in this game is horrid - but that is a whole 'nother story within itself.   To conclude, Spec Ops is not worth purchasing this game. While it is fun while it lasts, you will be forced into multiplayer, which is terrible. The games' mechanics only allow a handful of good classes, and that is the only way to do well in the game. Combined with a lack of emphasis on teamwork, the game becomes a muddled mess more than a competitive arcade shooter. If you want the best experience possible, I would highly reccomend picking up Black Ops 2, which fixes many of the problems addressed above.  ",0
"Heyyo, UGH! One of my worst purchases in a while.. friends told me how great this game was, and at first? It was pretty fun.. until people found the cheapest and most broken combos... like the dual 1887 shotguns.. akimbo rifles with grenade launchers and 'slight of hand'... made me rage. This game is so broken.",0
"ultimately i feel the games not very balanced amd very slow paced. As a casual game, theres more fun ones than this one, player populations are ok, but the host systems bad, ultimately not the most fun cod exsperience in my opinion.",0

Someone hacked my game or something and now I get a map overlay on my entire screen. Very hard to play because you can't really see anything. I've uninstalled the local files and reinstalled from the cloud. Still the same thing.,0
"This game was bad the way it was 6 years ago, it's still bad.  I'm not gonna go over an intial review, I just want to get into the heads of everyone who thumbed this up and want to know WHYYYYY did close to 12k users and 92% of them thumbed this monstrosity up? users voted on metacritic on average 5.5 out of ten from all 3 platforms with PC at 4.0 and highest 6.1 on consoles...  I did not forget why this game was considered terrible and the start of the 'Cash cow' Mass opinion which made dewritos and marijuanas popular Until Advanced warfare came out but that only put the 'Breaks' on the dying franchise.  Dedicated servers, Remember that launch date fuss? Nobody plays this damn game anyway and nobody wants to play running Peer to peer like it's the fall of napster or Bittorrent. OP guns: Intervention, ACR, Shotty, Care package, etc, remember these issues? Offensive missions: Remember, no russian. This was just a marketing tactic because the writers are garbage. and me, Why me? Because I supported this game, raged at it and spent over 100 hours in Multiplayer on this crap. (200+ on Xbox)",0
"I don't do the MP, so this is all about the SP. I put about 160 hours into this game on PC, completed all the missions multiple times on the highest difficulty, and have almost all the achievements. If I can do that, then better players like you will do great for sure. Overall, the game was not a waste of money, but it is sad to see a great franchise focus on the features I like least. I haven't bought a COD game since this one and based on watching other people play them, I am glad I didn't. If you want the best COD experience, COD4 or COD2 will serve you well. Never played COD3 since I don't own an Xbox or whatever console that was exclusive to.   If you liked COD: Modern Warfare, this game will appeal because it is pretty much the same game with lots of minor changes. It expands on the trends that set COD4 apart from the original WW2 shooters that COD was built on, expanding the special operations focus and focusing on bond-style villains weaving fancy plots to run the world in some way.   Technology also is greatly emphasized; COD4 was built on real weapons in wide use in the early 21st-century, while COD: MW2 makes commonplace what is rare or simply theorized even today. Most guns now have electronic sights instead of ironsights, automated weapon systems like sentry guns play a prominent role, and remarkably efficient UAVs with more firepower than a B52 menace the skies. If you want a more sci-fi than real-world experience of 'modern warfare' then you have found your game. Incidentally, the poor RPG7 rocketlauncher remains a big part of the battlefield and remains unable to hit anything more than 30 feet away without a huge dose of luck. So much for modernity!   If you like the classic 'common soldier fighting for his country' theme of the original COD series, you will be in for some, but not complete, disappointment.There are maps where average soldiers still fight average soldiers from other countries, but where they are fighting often requires considerable suspension of disbelief. What is clear is that COD: MW2 is continuing the trend of the franchise towards special ops missions where the real story revolves around elite special forces units who battle sinister evil geniuses weaving great conspiracies. Common soldiers like Paratrooper Martin and Sergeant Moody are very much passe. If you want Splintercell without the stealth mechanics, this will do something for you.   Like COD4, maps are tight enough to keep players from getting too lost and open enough, most of the time, to let players do more than simply charge straight into killzones. Some maps have tedious bottlenecks that will frustrate, so expect a few ragequits unless you are a masochist like me. So far, the grenade spam problem that makes many COD games very annoying is not too strong here; certainly not as bad as COD: World At War. You will have time to rest between rushes without too much fear of an endless rain of grenades appearing out of nowhere to punish you for your laziness. Infinite respawns are pretty reasonable in this game as well, so you aren't always going to lose for not having rushed after that last enemy getting shot.   One huge feature that greatly limits the appeal of this game for me: NO PC CONSOLE! COD consoles have always been fairly limited in their utility compared to games like Halflife, but for reasons that make no sense to me, IW has decided that players don't need consoles and so now players have no ablity to fine-tune their game settings, use cheats, or even fix some issues that could have been done in the past with five seconds of typing. This massively reduces the playability of the game for me. Before this game, I loved to see the beautiful animations and graphics in slow-motion. Can't do that here and that makes me sad.  ",0
to many hacked lobbys i got in to alot of them and got ♥♥♥♥ing vac banned wtf steam wtf,0
Terrible don't waste your money!,0
Buy this if you are dumb...I'm dumb,0
"To be totally honest, this game is not worth the money. Even on sale it's not worth it at all. The multiplayer is FULL of hackers. The only thing that's fun is the campain and the special ops but that can only last you so long. You join a game in multiplayer and you get all this op stuff... It takes away the fun and experience in leveling up. So you should hold on to your money and wait for another game you want to go on sale. Hope this helped '')",0
"This is a pitifully disgusting game now. ruined by hackers and little kids. hell both i should say. shameless lag switchers, aimbotters, wallhackers, hacked servers. Hackers killed this franchise because they have no skills and choose hacks to be better. No hackers you will never be better, if you use hacks you are less of a person and skills will always be better than hacks. and btw, you are not a hacker just because you use hacks, the person who made the hacks is a hacker, you are just subhuman scum in the gutters of forgotten humanity. if i was a zillionaire *even if that was a money amount* id buy this fncking franchise and set it straight, bring back up dedicated servers, update it with the latest hack defenses, idk theres sh!t out there. if it wasnt for hackers and little kids this would still be The Number One FPS shooter of all time. yes. im not exaggerating. But it is nice to find that one rare match where no one is actually hacking and its a non hacked lobby and acceptable connection, thats when the beauty of the game truly shines through. i dont recommend you buy this game, but you can if you want. i just bought it for old times sake because i had it on PS3.",0

"Verdict: Passable  While more technically competent than, say, Skyrim, it's an incredibly jerky, ill-paced game that tries to do too much in its time span. Too many weapons, too many twists, too many bad guys, too many gameplay types. It's never really content to allow for falling action of any kind. As soon as you reach the final objective of a mission, it cuts to a loading screen, with hardly a line from one of your squadmates or anything to provide a moment of relaxation, a feeling that you've made it and, for the moment, you're safe. Alternating between the Rangers and TF141 on a mission-by-mission basis for the first two acts of the game ruins any sense of continuity between the missions -- with each feeling about half the length of a Call of Duty 4 mission -- further exacerbates the lack of fulfilment provided by the end of each mission, because each mission ends on a particularly poor and jarring cliffhanger and you're thrown into the rising action of another mission in another place with different people before you've had a moment to decompress. It may be that Infinity Ward was trying to keep the tension high. But, if that is the case, they confused tension with action. Yes, an all-out firefight can be tense, but it quickly loses its dramatic appeal the more you do it in a given span of time. And, since you -start- the game in a firefight and do little else besides move from one firefight to the next, aside from some parts of some of the TF141 missions, you're basically forced to keep an adrenaline high for almost the entirety of the game's runtime. This also prevents even minimal characterization. So, when characters are killed, there is no emotional impact because there was no time or cause for you to become emotionally invested in them.   Even the death of Ghost is completely forgettable, because while he's present for almost the entirety of the game, he spends almost all of it off screen, and never does anything important or unique to distinguish himself from the rest of the TF141 mooks during the brief time he's a physical presence.   While there are some things the game does well, such as the first mission with Roach and Soap and the way the end of 'Of Their Own Accord' and the beginning of 'Second Sun' tied together (the beginning of 'Second Sun' honestly took me by surprise), they are few and far between, lost in the sharp scene changes and deafening non-stop gunfire.  I'd be lying if I said the story lacked drama, but most of what drama it has immediately falls apart when you think about how ludicrous the plot is. The villain's plan was needlessly complicated, bloody, and destructive, especially given its purpose, which could have been accomplished much easier and cleaner with the clever usage of media and politics. But what broke my suspension of disbelief was not how out of hand it got, not how far off the deep end the villain had gone to even consider it to be a good idea, but how willing the villain's lackeys were to let him carry on and how freely they seemed to provide their assistance. It is clear they are trying to top the first Modern Warfare. However, the first Modern Warfare was already pushing the limits of reason while still trying to set the stakes high. Modern Warfare 2 front-loads so much ridiculous escalation, much of it climax-worthy material, that you really can't help but think every time 'It  can't get any worse.' And yet it always does, and never in a good way. If I didn't know any better, I'd say there was a team at Infinity Ward that did nothing but sit around and play 'One Up' for the entirety of the script-writing process, just to come up with new ways to turn up the heat, regardless of whether or not they actually made sense in the grand scheme of things. The scene of using foxholes and trenches to avoid machine gun nests on your approach to a ruined, Russian-occupied White House screams WWII callback. Aside from that, though, it does little but try to show the player just how bad things are in DC by stirring up patriotic anger. The same kind of patriotic anger that the game itself practically condemning, both in its plot and in the quotes that are displayed on screen after you die. And, by this point, the game has gone on far too long with its messages of treason through patriotism for that to be the point. Not to mention, the game isn't smart enough for it to have ever been the point to begin with.  When they announced the original Modern Warfare, Infinity Ward said they wanted to make the campaign feel a lot more like a film. And they succeeded. With a well-paced plot that followed a clear dramatic arc, parallel subplots that contributed to the overall scenario in a positive manner without weighing it down, missions that had their own miniature dramatic arcs, and the sense of danger and urgency needed to justify the faster-paced gameplay, Modern Warfare was a good action movie. While most of the actors went without characterization beyond 'Spec-Ops hardass', 'Military grunt', or 'Total evil psychopath', such archetypes are pretty much standard for military action movies, and they were neither over-done nor hammed up, and were almost always present, leading to a solid core cast you came to care at least a -little- about by the end. Combine that with carefully-placed and well-handled twists -- the end of Jackson's subplot in particular was wrung out for as much drama as they could justify -- it was a game that, despite ending up as the spearhead of the subgenre that has taken over the FPS, stands out as an example of trying something new with a franchise without completely butchering the job. Modern Warfare 2, on the other hand, is the result of trying to capitalize on the success of a new idea without understanding what made the new idea  good .  If you're  desperately  curious to find out what happened to Soap and Captain Price following the events of Call of Duty 4, or you just want to understand what all the fuss is about, Modern Warfare 2 is worth a play, with some emphasis on 'a play', as in the singular. If not, perhaps you can help unmake the rest of the franchise by silencing  its  truth, leaving only the deaths of 30,000 Marines, and the sacrifice of the 22nd SAS to avenge them, that the horrors of that week would not return to haunt the future.",0
"I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that.",0

Full of Hackers?. Yes. Matchmaking will put you into hacked lobby's randomly?. Yes. Hacked lobby's will ruin your stats and auto unlock everything?. Yes. There is no point of playing after your stats where hacked therefore you won't grind to unlock prestige. Only way I found to fix my stats to start from 0 and save my progress as I played incase I ran into a hacked lobby was using a program that would would reset stats and save my progress. After 400 hours steam decided this program I was running was a hack and I got VAC banned and lost my game and my profile is marked as a hacker. I wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemy.,0

"This game is great. USUALLY. The multiplayer is next to unplayable because of all the hackers. You are most likely going to join a lobby, (which some hacker will be in control off) and get boosted to Level 70. Then, Valve Anti-Cheat is going to VAC ban you because you were boosted. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It is a waste of money and a terrible experience. Everything else is great though.",0
"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  Don't get me wrong this is one of my favorite games ever but IW has completely given up on anti cheat and almost every single person cheats. Not like they aim too fast, like 4 c-130s circling around the map at once while the host flies around with dual grenade launchers telling everyone to get rekt I repeat  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME",0
"The game is very fun and an older cod that brings back memories... But the multiplayer system is hacked. I would have about 80 hours right now... but I just wasted my money buying a game that doesn't have multiplayer. If you are in a lobby with hackers, you'll most likely get banned. I could go on but this isn't worth it.",0
"i do not recommend this game, because in multiplayer there could be a hacked server resulting in unlocking EVERYTHING, for some people its AWESOME, but not to me because it just ruins the point in multiplayer with unlocking everything altogether, so i would like a refund because of that, thats the reason for MY refund",0
My mutiplayer dont load!!!!!!!,0
12 year olds cussing more than sailors.... same BS game play as EVERY CoD... and players who in my honest opinion need to get outta the house a bit more...,0
"So, multiplayer is still working great.  Not. ",0

"The online gameplay in it's current state (sept 16 2014) is unplayable, there are barely any players (300 to 500) and matchmaking is worse than ever. This game is overrun with hackers and I'm not exaggerating. My minimap has been permanently disabled from hacks used by other players. There will be at least 1 hacker in every game, usually more. I see people using aimbots in EVERY game.",0
"This game maybe good on console, but on pc this game is absolute garbage. Its full of hackers, noobtubers and hardly anyone plays, so most of the time you run into at least 1 hacker per lobby.   I'm only giving this game a thumbs down because of how much this game is hacked. I recommand that is you want to play this game, go buy it on console because you will have way more fun.",0
"Tp be real I have no idea why they say this is the best cod game of all time, maybe in sales. The game is ok, the multiplayer is crap because everyone is cheating, and not just a little, a whole lot, and no one gets kicked,to me it is the worst call of duty ever.",0
"Not the best game to play if you want to play a FPS. Single player is quite bad and short, multiplayer is a non-strategical mode, just shoot and respawn and shoot more while being shot by 15-y-o kids who are screaming at his mic (and in fact are better at shooting and screaming than you).  Buying it for 25 euros was a waste of money and I regret it. Even if it was 5 euros, I'd be upset.",0
"It's now full of hackers. I decided to rejoin my nostalgic game of MW2, but as soon as I joined a lobby, I was instantly hacked and prestiged. Good, yet bad at the same time :&lt;.",0
Hate it because theres hackers and i got vac banned for no reason at all they have no proof if i hacked or not DONT GET IT wait for Black Ops III,0
Got VAC-Banned because a hacker unlocked everything in my account (Still think this is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.) Now I have a VAC-Ban on my record for NO ♥♥♥♥ING REASON!,0
"A great game, that is completely unmonitored, with hackers in most lobbies with the ability to change your rank and remove all of the weapons you've unlocked. It's a broken game now, don't buy it if you want it for multiplayer.",0
Pls don't buy this game. I've played it 3 days and have to deal with nothing but scumbag kids with trainers. save your money for something better than this,0
"Had fun playing the campaign Multiplayer was fun for the time I got to play it Left game to see I was level 70 Got vac banned can't play game anymore  3/8 campaign was good, but if you don't wanna get vac banned don't waste your money.",0
"A great game left to decompose.   As much as I enjoy playing this time to time, there are a few reasons why you shouldn't get into it. That's all up to you to decide however.  First, the good:  1. Fairly adult playerbase, I guess mainly because most are the original players from the day.  2. I haven't played Campaign in many years, in fact since I completed it, about 5 years ago, but I remember it was pretty good. 3. Fastpaced multiplayer action.  4. This game doesn't attempt at stealing all your freetime like some other games do, it's fun, but not addictive. 5. This works on Mac, I am not sure if other CoDs don't, but one of my friends recently bought this because it was Mac compatible.   Now the bad:  1. Hackers. It wasn't always nearly as bad as it is now. I am not sure how it works exactly, but InfinityWards seems to not have updated their anticheat system for a few years now and just about any lobby is permiated with a hacker as a result.  2. Unbalanced weapons. I'd guesstimate that 65% of all players use UMP, which is a clear sign your game isn't very well balanced. Some things like reloading on the Intervention has clearly been artificially slowed down, to balance stats out I guess, but still, it's not pretty and it stands out a country mile.   3. It's bloody expensive! I mean, this is 2015 we are living here and this came out in 2009 and it costs 20 USD, which isn't far off what it was at time of its release, I am thinking 7-10 USD maybe? I know it's CoD and CoDs must be expensive by law, but still... If you are going to have a 6 year old game still available for purchase, maybe make it more appealing by offering it at a lower price?  4. Playerbase is small, as You would expect, you'd have to work out the hours when most people come on, otherwise tough luck getting into a SnD when there's like one lobby hosted in the world.   5. Motherf***ing Kicktool! I am not quite sure where IW's common sense was when they allowed people to use that thing, my guess is that this supposed to let people rid of hackers, well no, usually it's used by a-holes to rid off people they cannot outskill. Very quite dissapointing.   I would pass on buying this if I were you, I am sure there are better options for your 20 USD.",0
I don't reccomend this game it is a waste of money. I was just playing nearly level 70 and then i get into a hacked lobby i left and now whenever i go into a online game i get kicked for nothing and then it says 'Cheat Detected' but i don't mod modern warfare 2 and then when i go into a private match i see as a command i think and says 'Cannot kick host player' millions of times and have to reset my stats every time i go on fix this and i will be keeping it if you don't fix this it is getting sold,0
10/10 wouldn't recommend,0
"Single player very good, Multiplayer HACK CITY. Is terrrible, steam does not care, publisher does not care, do not get it.",0
"I used to play this a few years ago and this was a game worth playing. The campaign mode was good, the multiplayer mode was decent and it ran smoothly. I have started playing once more for the past three months and I will admit. I have had enough! The campaign may still be good (although it runs a little slower for me now) but the worst thing about this game is the darn multiplayer.  Allow me to tell you why for this one very good reason in my humble opinion:  It has been hacked to oblivion- I click to play TDM in the game mode selection menu, I wait to be connected to what appears to be a TDM and I somehow land up playing Domination. What makes things worse is that the host can reset the match at the end without allowing you to change up your classes in the after match intervals. This means you go straight back into to domination ON A TDM SERVER CHOICE. This, added with lightning fast quick scopes, grenade launcher addicts, bunny hoppers (people whom jump and shoot/ avoid fire), spawn campers (sitting near enemy respawning places to get easy kills) and the aimbots makes for a very unpleasent gaming experience.   While Treyarch/Activision and ect will have likely to have been furiously working away to conjure a new way to make the public £100 poorer with a sequal to a previous title, they have been forgetting to make sure that their older releases are still being maintained for the enjoyment of hardcore loyalists to the older games that were released. No anti-hack updates or PunkBuster equivilent software has been created to stave away the hackers which suck the joy out of everything.  This may be irrelevant now as no one will be buying this or caring anymore. However I hope the developers are aware that yes, there are still people who play the older games and unfortunately people sad enough to hack them also (probably because they are better than the recent ones i.e Ghosts and Advanced Warfare in my opinion are enormous piles of rubbish trying to keep up with Halo). Getting back to this game, I would not recommend it because of how frustratingly terrible the game has become to even attempt to play. If you want to be hounded by the feinds listed above then go for it, but not for me as I have had my fill and so with that I conclude by saying: consider yourselves warned.",0
Stopped working after a week. Activision gave ♥♥♥♥ support. I wish that I bought this game AFTER Steam refunds became a thing.,0
The baby one.,0
"Any Call of Duty in the series will tear you apart. How you may ask? Well, Let's just say 'vocab', and rage. That is what I best describe this game. Also, this will tear your family apart as well.",0
It Keeps Saying Cheat Detected For No Reason... FIX IT!!!!,0
Back in the day I would have suggested this game. I spent crazy hours playing Multiplayer Online. It's such a shame that the PC version multiplayer is dead now. I hear that Xbox is still alive. The single player was fun but short. Bad Company 2 was my next FPS and I enjoyed the single player more.         RATE:   3 OUT OF 10     ,0
"Honestly don't buy it if you want to get a lot of time out of it and play multiplayer. Youtubers and reviews all said that multiplayer has a ton of hackers that will hurt your steam/computer and even some take out all exit functions. So I didn't play multiplayer, which is a large part of the game. I got about 10 hours out of this game before getting bored of it, and five of which were campaign and the other five special ops. Campaign is much better. Special ops is pretty fun, but it can be annoying trying to get new missions by playing the ones you hate. Overall, save the $20 and go buy Cs:go or Cod4 (which has multiplayer thats not hacked as much)",0
Keeps crashing its a peice of ♥♥♥♥ ,0
don't make the same mistake i did nobody plays this game on multiplayer anymore so basically all you have is a 3 hour campaign and special ops that basically suck,0
Best COD released but its crap now cuz of all hackers,0
"Each week I play it seem there are more hacked games and many more games with poor host, dropped connections. The CoD MWII experience on line is getting worse...don't think I'll be playing online for much longer.",0
I would love to say a must have... but this makes CoD4 looks seperior. And the Yearly-New CoD game destroys this franchise.,0
Thanks for getting me vac banned. Although i didn't use any cheat :) because i joined a ♥♥♥♥ing hacked lobby so i am banned.. -_-,0
"Campaign is another dull, Brown People/Foreigner Murder simulator 2009. Lacks any wit or intelligence present in COD4. The multiplayer is hailed as the best of the series, but then again what do 11 year olds know? The only redeeming qualtiy of this ♥♥♥♥ fest is the Spec Ops missions, which are occasionally fun to play.",0
all it needed was DServers and it would have been great :(  fun while it lasted  ,0
My multiplayer for MW2 doesn't load. I just bet a black screeb,0
Dont buy this game random vacbans and ♥♥♥♥ for no reasons,0
liked the campaign but hate the multi player.total chaos,0
Too many hackers.,0
Steam took it away from me after about a week for no reason i Called them and they said we cant allow a game like this is out web.site,0
"this game was terrible, i had it for a weekend and during that time there were so many hackers, also you cant pick what server you want to go to, its all automated.",0
"Multiplayer was fun for the first 3-4 months after release. No dedicated servers, Punk Buster or any post launch support to deal with hackers meant that after people figured out how to hack it the game was truely unplayable.  ",0
hi i get cod6 and i play it 9 hours and i get baned for no reason now i can't play and like evry normal people i get mad and i want to fix that s**t and i want to be unbaned to have posibility to play these game  Somebody how have the same problem to help me please.  Sory for my bad english,0

"This game maybe good on console, but on pc this game is absolute garbage. Its full of hackers, noobtubers and hardly anyone plays, so most of the time you run into at least 1 hacker per lobby.   I'm only giving this game a thumbs down because of how much this game is hacked. I recommand that is you want to play this game, go buy it on console because you will have way more fun.",0
It is very good game but i choose the negative vote because the hackers ruined this game. 1.I lost my level progress by a hacker and i couldnt get it back. 2.There are a lot kids who kicks everyone out of the lobby except if you stand and they do 360 stupid shots. 3.A lot wallhackers and aimboters. 4.The nat is buggy and dosnt work with all routers properly so even if the port is open you cant host a game to avoid the modded lobbys. 5.They removed the Favela one of the best map on the game. ,0
"It is a good game, but i can never get in a lobby with out a hacker! way to many hackers, the MOST u should get it for is around $10 $15. 6.5/10",0
"The best COD game I've played. Singleplayer is great, but the multiplayer sucks, just about everyone hacks in one way or another, and most games are modified or changed in some way. Waste of money.",0
Alot of hackers on multiplayer. You will most likely get hacked to max perstiege and get all weps. You will prob join a hacked lobby on first try.,0
"The game is to short. 6 hours on normal mode, and i died plenty of times",0
"1st of all, I HATE the CoD games, I mean I HATE IT SO ♥♥♥♥ING MUCH, but this game is different from the others. The single player is full with action and adrenaline rich. The multiplayer, well its still a blood bath but can be fun. But some other players included me miss some features, for example the Server Browser, the Mod section, and the admin commands. If you love the FPS games, its for you. But the kiddos can ruin everything, so sometimes the mute function the best in the whole game. I really recommend it!",0
"I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that.",0
"This game used to be amazing in the past. I'm here to write a more accurate up to date review as of August 2014. This game is complete garbage now, with Call of duty 4 still having 10x the playerbase, this game has a flat 300 players for its playerbase, half the games are still to this day filled with hackers, and not to mention errors that this game comes with as soon as its installed, its a shame this game has gone to ♥♥♥♥, do not make my mistake and purchase this garbage, if you want something worth your money, call of duy 4 is still an amazing gem.",0
"Used to be a decent game.. blah blah blah... infinity ward is a horrible company, never buy from them ever.... blah blah blah... what else can I say that will inform even a single individual about what a piece of ♥♥♥♥ game this is today? There is nothing. So.. if you've not bought this game for whatever reason and you're thinking about it. Stop. Don't do it. Don't ever bother with Infinity Ward again.",0
I would totally reccomend this game if you are willing to go into a privat match with your friends and play against each other. Other than that no. The multiplayer is destroyed and not fun at all. With all the hackers its not even remotley fun. Makes you wonder why game developers abandon good games to drive people to the newer 'better' games like CoD Ghosts. Activison has become a money seeking company. One of the last good CoDs and will always remember it as a piece of ♥♥♥♥ game cause of my latest expirences with the multiplayer. And you can only play the campaign so many times before you are bored out of your mind.,0
Hackers everywhere you go.,0
this game has a lot of hacker so no i dont recommend this game,0
Needs to have the valve Cheat Symbol removed.,0
Very good game but to many hackers...i don't want play anymore...Nobody protect us from hackers!!,0
too many hacked lobbies.,0
"It's hacked to death, spawns are broken, rapid fire 2 shotting guns, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ maps, and a terrible commmuntiy. Other than that it's great!",0
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was the most popular Call of Duty of all time. It has an engaging campaign and the visuals at the time were top notch. But its glory days have passed. The multiplayer is riddled with hacks and it is almost impossible to find an unhacked server. So if you are looking at this game for the multiplayer then I would look elsewhere. If you are looking at this then I would wait until the price drops but until then I cannot recommend this game simply because of its age and non working service.,0
"Im going to try to be fair with this one as ive strayed away from the call of duty franchise for many reasons (the only one i enjoyed out of all of them was 4). The Pros: Graphics, Music (Hans Zimmer, enough said) Sound, and finally Voiceacting; these were all amazing. The Cons: No dedicated servers, extremely broken multiplayer (unbalanced weapons, broken spawns etc), no kicking banning or choosing map types either. Lots of exploits and glitches as well as hackers. Infinity Ward basically restricted the game from having any fun when you think about it. Personally i wish i could get my money back.",0
"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was good when it came out.  Now it is just sad. With all those hackers and their hack servers sending you to prestige 10, when you wanna level up yourself and earn all those things.  i managed to get prestige 4 before getting into a hacked server which turned me into prestige 10.  So i've done my fair share of resetting. But then i got tired of resetting every now and then and eventually stopped playing.  Back in the day i would score it 10/10 but today i will probably score it 3/10",0
"It could have been fun. But there are no dedicated servers, so one of the players is chosen to serve as host, which usually results in a terrible connection and a lot of lag. Once the game notices that, it looks for another host. The original host is kicked after the host migration (because the game obviously has to be as annoying as possible), and the thing starts all over again. If no other host is found, everyone is just thrown out of the game. There is also no way to kick or ban the hackers, which is great fun as well. The same thing goes for hacked lobbies - sometimes, you join a game that is modified, meaning some weapons can't be used, the game mode is different, your settings and stats can be changed and other things. Of course, there's nothing you can do about it. Dedicated servers would fix that as well. Of course, those are impossible, because Activision says so. Giving you the ability to play the game mode you want without lags and with the ability to ban hackers could actually make this game fun! We obviously can't have that. So: If you're lucky and get a host with a good connection, you can play the Team Deathmatch mode. No one bothers to queue for other game modes, because there's not enough people playing them - of course, hacked lobbies do have other modes from time to time. And if you're really, really lucky, maybe there's no hacker in the game either, so you can even enjoy it.",0

"'still rocks. no ded. servers but still better than BlackOps.' - Thats been my Review... until now.  Dont get me wrong, this game is awesome and I love playing Multiplayer. Oh wait. I loveD. But since they sued '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥net' and '4deltaone', which did a pretty great job with developing some modification for this game (New Gamemodes, New Maps, Dedicated Servers...) it just got horrible.  Sorry InfinitiyWard - but your policies really suck. No one buys this game anymore. No one plays it anymore. So why do you even care if somebody makes it playable for the last remaining fans?  'Black Ops' was the last CoD I bought after MW2 - and I did regret it - it felt like playing in mud... But those lawsuits against 4deltaone make it clear: CoD is dead (for me!), I will switch to Battlefield, DayZ and ArmA. R.I.P. CoD, its been a great time. ;)",0
Excelent multiplayer ruined by hackers. A good camain. Can't recommend due to number of hackers.,0
Someone hacked my game or something and now I get a map overlay on my entire screen. Very hard to play because you can't really see anything. I've uninstalled the local files and reinstalled from the cloud. Still the same thing.,0
Don't even waste your money,0
I really liked this game but its multiplayer was ruined by cheaters and hackers &gt;:-[,0

"first of all, COD on Steam? nope. dont bother &gt;-&lt; there are hackers evreyehere. its a hacker paradise. just get this game on xbox 360 and its not bad. mW2 is a decent game, but not on steam. the campaign is playable and spec-ops is pointless scince you cant unlock any other missions ._. oh and   Xxx_MLGFaZeCLAN360PU$$YDESTROYER_xxX  dont forget the dew and doritos.",0
"To be totally honest, this game is not worth the money. Even on sale it's not worth it at all. The multiplayer is FULL of hackers. The only thing that's fun is the campain and the special ops but that can only last you so long. You join a game in multiplayer and you get all this op stuff... It takes away the fun and experience in leveling up. So you should hold on to your money and wait for another game you want to go on sale. Hope this helped '')",0
"Lobbies have nothing but hackers. If your looking for the game you played on your 360/  Ps3 then this is not it. It's just hackers, who can't be killed. Infinite health, 1 shot kill water guns. If you like hackers here's your game. If they annoy you then do not purchase this game.",0

Was fun when it first started.. now its an abandoned mall in russia,0
"great game worth your money, but wouldnt buy it if you wanted to play multiplayer as you join a game to have fun and rank up and automaticaly your max rank and have everything due to hackers who have made the game theirs by tuning the games their way, so they always win and you cant play the game you intended to play unless you host a private match where you cant level up  this is dissapointing due to spending money on the game :( !",0

I can't even PLAY the game anymore because some hacker put this GIANT MAP in the middle of my screen! Even if I restart the game it's still there.  They also have acess to your LOADOUTS too, and some hacker took ALL my items from me.  Would I recommend this? Well, maybe. If you don't mind all the hacking and taking away all your items and giant maps on the screen. Just maybe.",0
"It used to be fun when I played multiplayer with my friends but the game itself isn't fun.  The multiplayer is unbalanced, full of immateur idiots and lacks variety (by saying that I mean community made maps, mods and etc.) it only has few maps and it isn't fun to play most of them. To get few more maps and gamemodes, you have to buy expansion packs for ridiculous price and the game itself has ridiculous price.   The singleplayer isn't very good too. Its story is naive and illogical. It would look interesting probably only for 8 year old children.  There are only few things in this game that are fun but you shouldn't buy it for such price. There are more much cheaper, more interesting and more balanced first person shooters to buy.",0
I would not recommend buying this game at this point cuz it is more than 4 years old. The game has almost no players left on multi player and most of the time you get the same enemies over and over again. Most of the gamemodes in the game have 0 players. In total the game has around 1000 players.,0
"Well the bad thing is there are so MANY hackers and if they get VAC Ban, they just make new account and share their library.. so they can get back on and hack again easily so I think the anti cheat should work better to stop the hackers from ruining the game I stopped playing MW2 and barely play it because of hackers. GOOD THING: It's cheap, great game but just too many hackers. Hope this helped. If you get this game I recommend just playing single player and on servers with no hackers.",0
played game got free ♥♥♥♥ from hacker. couldn't quit got a free vac ban 10/10 would play again,0
"This Call of Duty was the first step downward, and it sunk every year, even more and more.",0
huge disappointment from CoD4: Modern warfare.,0
dead game but for really i lied there are real players but they are haker)),0
"Just awful, avoid at all costs.",0
"Its an OK game, but there are many hackers/Modders on the multiplayer side of it, witch i dont like.",0
"how boring can this game be? no one moves around, everyones sits in a corner waiting what a waste of time",0
"With nearly a thousand hours played in Singleplayer and Multiplayer it makes me sad to give this a negative review now. I loved this game. I used to play this all f****n day long after school with my friends and even made new friends.   It used to be the best game I ever played but now it's literally dead except for hackers, campers and ofcourse trolls. To bad that the newer games don't give the same feeling like this one did. I guess it's time to say goodbye and finally uninstall it.  May my memory of this game stay always in my mind and the pure joy that I felt, shall stay in my heart. RIP &lt;/3",0
"No dedicated server support in multiplayer. Not only does this mean there is virtually no ability to play on custom user created maps (unless you play locally) but it means you get put in games with no attention to connection issues, skill level or map choice. This one thing alone ruined it for me. If this doesn't bother you I'd say it's a great game, all of what you'd expect from the COD series. Haven't gotten much into the single player campaign yet but what I've played has been pretty decent.",0
i do like the game but im consantly getting only one bar connections. can anyone help me  ,0
buying the dlc broke my game and i cant play domination anymore,0
Lack of players makes this game less enjoyable than it used to be.,0
"Game randomly decided not to start after a new steam patch, dont waste your money, go buy the disc at gamestop or from somewhere that will escape you from steam's ♥♥♥♥ service",0
"This game is amazing, campaign and multiplayer, but when you try to play multiplayer, its like super rare not to end up in a hacked or modded lobby, I would recommend this game... but too many hackers ",0
"Even though my computer exceeds the minimum requirements to run this game, multiplayer still doesnt seem to start up as quick as the campaign or special ops.",0
good game but lot of hackers. ,0
Got VAC banned for random connect to hacked server GG,0
One of the best online shooters to date which is sadly filled with hackers nowadays.,0
"Its an OK game, but there are many hackers/Modders on the multiplayer side of it, witch i dont like.",0
"So... this game. This is also probably the 50 millionth review you've read for it.  The single player pretty much took everything that made Modern Warfare 1 great, repeated it ad nauseum, then tacked on a omg amurrka is under attack theme. It didn't work.  Some pros with this game though is Keith David. Because Keith David.  http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202966/  - He can Oscar Mike me anytime he damn well pleases.  Other pros are the Ramirez, do everything meme. Regardless of what anyone says, that meme is solid gold and I laugh whenever it comes up.  The multiplayer features 3 maps, lots of optional downloadable content at cost, hackers, and ♥♥♥♥♥ing. If you want to succeed at this game's multiplayer, just attach a grenade launcher to an assault rifle, use the Scavenger and Explosive Damage perks, and provide your team-mates with some morale-boosting Heavy Metal micspam.",0
Twelvies. Oh God so many Twelvies...,0
This game was really good then i figuered out that they used the ending in the beginning of ghost,0
The community i just full of people who are old to this game so i reccomend that you dont buy this game after 2013 because youll just keep getting deathstreaks,0
"Great for a call of duty game, but compared to good games it's ♥♥♥♥",0
Don´t look at the negative reviews to find some faults. Go and buy this awesome Call of Duty &lt;3,0
I would like to update my old review from back in 2014 in January 1st.  I'll keep it short by saying that I wouldn't recommend this game.  The singleplayer is fun but what most people are probably after is the multiplayer which this game is not-so-great with - maybe back when it first came out?  I find I'm lagging constantly (with good internet) and the game also seems to crash a lot telling me there are 'file mismaches' to which I've gone and fixed with the validation of game files to which the game STILL tells me that I have mismatched files.,0
"Can't say this game is all that great anymore. The single campaign is just not gripping and lasts 5 or 6 hours at best. There are still some people playing multiplayer, but you're SOL if you want to play anything other than Team Deathmatch, Free for All, and Search and Destroy. Really only pick this up if you have nostalgia from playing it on an old console.",0
5/10 lame propaganda. gameplay itself -get shot just get to cover and you will be good while everyone else is an idiot -runs out and dies from a few shots.,0
there's a lot of hacker ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥in multiplayer,0
"'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.' A review by Richard Valkinsenn.  EDIT: My original review of Modern Warfare 2 has been updated to reflect my changed opinion of the game. I have a lot to say about it, and not a lot of it's good. The review is now broken up into two sections and will cover the game's campaign and multiplayer suites, respectively.  ---- CAMPAIGN REVIEW ----  Modern Warfare 2 is the pinnacle of the Call of Duty series, second only to it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. Unfortunately, factoring in both the game's single-player and multiplayer suites, that's not really saying much. Campaign-wise, admittedly, Modern Warfare 2's campaign does feature a thrilling, well-acted campaign, and comes packed with thrills and chills, the latter of which is mostly contained in the campaign's notorious 'No Russian' mission. While the campaign's level design is linear, thankfully the player is given a wide variety of roles throughout the game's runtime. One level will feature a tense series of firefights with loads of enemies while another will have the player moving stealthily in a semi-linear fashion from point A to point B. As for long-lasting appeal, somehow, Modern Warfare 2 has a charm that has withstood the test of time.  The campaign also features a co-op mode featuring missions based on scenarios seen not just in Modern Warfare 2 but also it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. These missions are widely varied and feature time attacks, stealth missions, and other various modes for up to two players to engage in. There are a few missions which require no less than two players, but thankfully, the majority of the missions can be completed solo, if players so desire.  Sadly, while the campaign and co-op modes are pretty solid, as far as a PC port goes, the entire package as a whole is found wanting. For starters, the game's options lack many essential PC features, like a Field of View (FOV) slider. In fact, it seems the developers went out of the way to make it difficult to even edit the native FOV via console or cfg edits. Not to mention the fact that the lack of separated audio sliders makes trying to tailor the game's audio experience to one's liking impossible. What makes it even worse is the lack of mod support, meaning basically that making custom content for the game is something that's just not gonna happen. Above all else, what makes it all even worse is the game's multiplayer suite, which only serves to highlight many of the game's glaring faults.  Campaign Verdict: I liked it.  ---- MULTIPLAYER REVIEW ----  Years ago, I played Modern Warfare 2 on Xbox LIVE and rather enjoyed it. However, having transitioned to the PC in the last several years and having played other, superior online titles, I've found Modern Warfare 2's PC multiplayer suite to be nothing short of a train wreck.  In addition to the glaring lack of an FOV slider, so much power and choice was taken out of the player's hands in this game. Dedicated servers, or at least a server browser for choosing matches is non-existent. Voting to kick or ban problematic players was left out. Mod support for custom content is gone. A much-needed feature like hiding the in-game chat log is just not there. And sure you could host a private match, but hosting a public match with custom rules and map rotations is a thing of the past. Well, unless you hack it in, but then you run the risk of getting hit with a Valve Anti-Cheat ban.  Then you get to the actual gameplay that Modern Warfare 2 has to offer... and it gets a little better and a lot worse from there. While MW2's maps are thankfully not as restrictive as later titles in the overall series, they still suffer from a near-complete lack of interactivity. Not everything about the maps is terrible, however, as they do allow for a multitude of different tactics and approaches, though this also applies to hiding spots and long, open stretches for campers to exploit. As far as the game's arsenal and perks go, there's a lot of room for mixing and matching to create a lot of different approaches and playstyles. At the same time, weapon customization is sadly hampered by the fact that only one attachment is allowed at a time, though a certain perk can allow up to two. However, adding this perk to a loadout means that no other perks in that perk's category can be applied.  Above all else, there's one thing that makes Modern Warfare 2 just about unbearable at any time, and it's an issue that also extends to the entire series, overall. A lot of the methods for getting kills in Modern Warfare 2 require little to no skill to employ. An example would be the addition of quick, one-hit knife kills that can be require little more than a button press, in addition to lethal traps that can be laid for other players. Several of the game's perks also exacerbate this, like a perk that expands the lethal radius for explosives or another that increases the distance over which knife kills apply. Not to mention the fact that the game doesn't treat fired shots like projectiles; once the sights are lined up, bullet hits are instantly guaranteed, no matter the distance.  Overall, while it has many high points, Modern Warfare 2 on the PC leaves way too much to be desired. A glaring lack of much-needed PC features along with an array of lackluster gameplay features sours an online and even offline experience with lots of untapped potential.  Multiplayer Verdict: It could've been much better.",0
I got banned for nothing dont buy this game ...,0
Joined 3 matches literally 8 people using aimbot and 5 people noob tubing FUN,0
This franchise shoud be call of Hacks!!,0
"Whos up for talking about the campaign? NO ONE! There was a few nice mission but half way through it started to fell dull. The ending was super bad. Mute everyone in the lobby and hide the chat and youre all good. Try not to play scrapyard, its filled with people who enjoys the tubes. Its aged well.",0
"This Part of the Call of Duty Frabchise was pretty much fun back in the days of its release, nowdays you will most likely only find hacked lobbies &amp; hackers playing online. Still it was much fun to play the first year after release.  Nowdays I would not recommend buying it, only for story mode.",0
Everything works fine except if you want to play a game with a friend. You either have to get extremly lucky and manage to join join a friends lobby/game or just spend ages trying over and over to join (No guarantee it will work). I understand It's a reasonably old game but that doesn't excuse one of the main components of the game not working.  So if you are looking to play with a friend don't bother. :/ Very dissapointed.,0
"MW2 single player is by far the best, but I would avoid if your looking to play online multiplayer unless you enjoy cheating, hacking piece of crap players that still suck even when they cheat...servers are all full of cheating ♥♥♥♥ heads that ruin a great game! generation of waste",0
It's a console import. If you own it already on Xbox 360 or PS3 then do NOT buy it on steam. You are better off with Call of Duty 4 because it has PC exclusive features and a bigger community.,0
"Simply one of the best Call of Duty's out there, but this game is nearly broken but the hackers, snipers, and Danger Close noob tubes. Not worth $20 anymore.",0
Shooter on rails,0
COD SUCKS!,0
THIS GAME IS HACKED!!!!!!!,0
i was put in a modded lobby and then ban servers are bad need fixing still after so many years,0
Keeps crashing its a peice of ♥♥♥♥ ,0
"As a CoD veteran (CoD, CoD:GO, CoD 2, CoD:MW, CoD:WaW), i was VERY disapointed with this game once i played it for the first time. And im still a bit disapointed every time i load it. Activision tried to be a hipster and killed actual servers the thing every FPS so far was OK with. But no... Activision have to make changes, even destroy dedicated servers in order to look like they're doing something out there. That step was a TERRIBLE, HORRIFYING MISTAKE. And unspeakable disgrace. With one move they destroyed MW:2. Still its a great COPY of a game, after a while you can get used to the damn thing.",0
"dead as all hell, and I have been nothing but apathetic about it.  although this game historically is strange, highlighting some of the most stupid descisions ever made by businesses- Removing dedicated servers, hogging profits, and just drama galore.  this was something EVERYBODY played, then modern warfare 3 happened, everybody moved to it and MW2 died.  it had something I did like about mutliplayer- and that is sustainability- a sense of progression, even if it is a stupid grind, at least there's clear and obtainable rewards. (too many F2P shooters and thier ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EXPIRING PARTS, die please.)  after this game, modern warfare went down the damn hill, way down the damn hill.",0
it was okay,0
The start of the decent of Call of Duty...,0
its ok...barely played it,0
Nobody plays it................,0
The baby one.,0
Black screen on widows XP I can´t launch it!!!,0
"The lack of dedicated servers really hurts the game, if you get into a hacked lobby you'll get VAC banned, plus nobody plays it, if you plan to buy this, please don't; if you are doing it for 'da ztory', just get another shooty game with a good story (may I recommend Bioshock Infinite?).  tl;dr fon't buy this, ever.",0
"This is where Call of Duty began its long decline. Single player (as most of the game in this series) is good and fascinating and multiplayer HAD its good moments (TDM and S&amp;D) but the matchmaking system is really bad. As soon as Black Ops got released this game pretty much died and survives only with hackers dominating servers. I would buy this game now only for &lt;10€ for its single player part (if you liked Call of Duty 4, which is still largely played and the best Call of Duty ever in my opinion)",0
"Great game back in the day(Review doesnt show it but I have approx. 600 hours on multiplayer), is now a ghost town and run by hackers. Get it on console, you can get a pre-owned copy for less than 3 pounds, has *way* more players on it and less hacker while this still costs 20 pounds.  On a side note, the single player visuals hold up extremely well.",0
"This game is absolutely ♥♥♥♥, too much hackers, campers and people that spray with G18s... I recommend people to buy ArmA or Battlefield instead of any of the ♥♥♥♥ CoDs",0
It's full fo hackers and good luck getting a refund... f**k this game.,0
"Ingame Settings are so bad you can't change FOV or open console, its locked at what looks like 55 making unplayable while sitting at a deks",0
"This is my story. I've bought this game several months ago and I really enjoyed it untill today! From (Random date in the beggining of October 2013) untill January 6th 2014, the game was great I really liked it, but today (7th January) in every server I join is either hacked or looses connection. I think today will be the last time I'll play this game.   Oh, I also forgot to say, that I was level 42, but after a 5 seconds game in a hacked server, I got to level 70! I want to enjoy the game normally, not getting in a hacked lobby every time I search for a TDM server! These ♥♥♥♥ING hackers ruined my CoD MW2 experience!  THANK YOU HACKERS!!!  You may see that this review was posted on the 20th October, yes at first I said that this is probably the best CoD ever, but now I understood how much I was wrong :(",0
Game is crud. Reported to the FBI. 10/10. I wouldn't even waste one hour on this pile of crud.,0
Thanks for getting me vac banned. Although i didn't use any cheat :) because i joined a ♥♥♥♥ing hacked lobby so i am banned.. -_-,0
I sunk an unhealthy amount of time into this game and truly enjoyed the competitive nature of it. Unfortunately the game became overrun with cheaters and Activision seemed more interested in churning out DLC rather than fix the problem. Because of that I cannot recommend this game and in fact have never played a COD game again.,0
"Okay let me first start off with saying this... This game is NOT worth $20!!!!!!! If you're really wanting to get this game, please do yourself a favor &amp; wait until Steam puts it up for sale. May be a while down the road, but I imagine they will eventually.  Having played this game for several hours, I have gotten into several modded servers. Granted, getting into a normal server was as easy as backing out &amp; searching again, but the thing is, this game sees like 600-800 players MAX on a good day. So you're not always going to be able to back out &amp; get into a normal server. You will sometimes back out &amp; then just rejoin the same modded server.  The negative aspect out of the way, this is still the same old MW2 you played years ago. It plays just the same &amp; when you DO get into a noraml server, it's loads of fun! I've never had any issues getting into full servers either, so it's got that going for it.   As far as hackers &amp; modders goes, I have never personally came across one, or if I did, I didn't notice. It's just the modded servers you have to watch out for. Play on those to long &amp; you could get slapped with a VAC Ban!  All in all this is a good game, but i really wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than die hard MW2 fans, or people trying to complete their CoD collection. It's a dying game! Yes it will ALWAYS have a player base, (mainly the hardcore MW2 fans) but if you're just getting into PC gaming, or looking for a new FPS, I would tell you to buy Call of Duty 4 instead. There are 4,000+ ACTIVE servers in that game &amp; the number of active players grow every day!",0
"it was good until i was slapped with a VAC ban. i wound up with 0.8 hours on record from starting out, and now I can't even play it online. i did nothing at all, so I wasted the 20-30 bucks for nothing. if you want to play this game, you should do it on console personally, unless you can make a private match and keep hackers out. this one was the best one to me and i feel ♥♥♥♥♥ over this.",0
"Simply one of the best Call of Duty's out there, but this game is nearly broken but the hackers, snipers, and Danger Close noob tubes. Not worth $20 anymore.",0

Go back to CoD 4 and you'll be good.,0

in my opinion one of the best call of duty games ever made but i dont recommend this game to buy  its because there are not a lot/none playing it...,0
"MW2 single player is by far the best, but I would avoid if your looking to play online multiplayer unless you enjoy cheating, hacking piece of crap players that still suck even when they cheat...servers are all full of cheating ♥♥♥♥ heads that ruin a great game! generation of waste",0
"I don't really recommend it, But it's up to you all. I played a few days and a few hours. But all i see is Hack servers. Leveling up, people wall hacking, people using cheats to fight there games. There not really doing anything. Just let the aimbot do it for them. I do really miss the fun of the game where it was a challenge, now it's just childs play where people hack there way through. I guess I'll just play on the 360, the only thing I have to worry about is Modded controllers. But I found a way through that, so it's no biggie to play. Just if Punkbuster and other hack shields and stuff were more well equip to handle hacks. I would def. Give this game a 10. But all I see is 2. Half of the game you will mostly find just hack servers. And the rest is just that people are trying to play without having all this trouble. But some want to find hack servers so they wont have to play through. I find alot of unskilled players in this game. But I'll leave it up to you to choose whether this game is for you to play.",0
Do not buy if you want it for mac freezes on lowest graphic setigs,0
"I played the heck out of this way back in the day, but these days there's newer and better games to spend time and money on. Look for one of the newer Call of Duty games or some of the free-to-play games emulating it.",0
I can't go back on call of duty modern warfare 2 because they thought I was hacking which I wasn't it might of been 'Cheat Engine 6.4' because I left it running all night,0
"Game was fun until the removal of the 4D1 client. Now it's ♥♥♥♥. No mods, no FoV slider ingame, just a joke of a PC game.",0
Doesn't worth 20$... not at all. Mulitiplayer is full of modded lobbies.,0
"So I was playing with my friends, and I knew one of my friends were cheating. But I didn't care about what he did and I just wanted to play because it was fun. So after some days he got VAC banned and we laughed at him. And the day after, I got VAC banned too...I have no idea why I got banned. Was it because I played with my friend that cheater or? The only thing I have to say now is ♥♥♥♥ OFF MW2",0
"If youre gonna buy this for multiplayer, like i did, dont bother now because i played 5 games and every single one had been hacked to extremity and unplayable so STAY THE ♥♥♥♥ AWAY!!! Unless you bought it for campaign or spec ops or just generally enjoy having a srsly ♥♥♥♥ed kd and not spawning at all :D Enjoy!",0
"This game is Good but not great. First off the muliplayer is a mess, in many ways it adds onto and improves on cod4's  mechanics (such as customible killstreaks and pro perks as well as more weapon diversity). But on the other hand you have  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like one man army noob tubes, commando, deathstreaks, Akimbo G18, and danger close that ruin the games balance and enjoyment.    The single player campaign is good and tells a compelling story but there are some things that aren't well explained and can leav you confused. The spec ops mode is just the campain exept with coop, fun, but doesen't really hold your attention for that long so feel free to skip it. But what hurts this game the most is the optimization, never in my life have I ever seen a game so effortlessly ported to the pc. The game is locked at nauseating 65 FOV (field of view) which will automatically makes the game feel weird to play since you are essenially staring through a pair of binoculars, thankfully there is an FOV changer that you can download for the muliplayer so make sure to get that if you ever plan on getting this game. Plus there are, get this, NO DEDICATED SERVERS.   Yep, no dedicated servers, basic pc features are non exsistent in this game! The lack of dedicated servers is what killed this game, instead of dedicated servers we get a crappy host based matchmaking system where everyone has to leech off of one guys connection meaning if the host has a bad connection you will have to play with laggy hit detection for the rest of the match. Oh and who can forget the oh so wonderful host migrations? Also the game is filled with hacked lobbies up the wazoo and some of them automatically rank you up to level 70 and give you everything ruining most of the replay value. Overall Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a disapointment and don't let any fanboy convince you that it isn't. I wouldn't recommend this game due to the how many asinine descisions were made with the port. But if you are still intrested in getting the game then be my guest, maybe you will be more satisfyed by what you got then I did.",0
"A decent game made when the iron was still hot unlike the upcomming title advanced warfare. (that game is gonna be bad without an ♥♥♥) This game added new kill streak rewards as well as more weapon customization which is not as comlicated as ghost, but still works fine. It was like it predecessor, only more epic and with maps that would become classics. And i must point out that the following titles never had any epic moments such as this game and with more bugs. (Kill streak rewards in this game were alot more rewarding)  But the main reason why i do not recommend this game is the linear campaign which is the formula of all the games in the series, but also that you should not support developers who desperatly try to recycle the old stuff, and add in a dog.   Consumers should be more descicive when ever they buy games. Without the money, talented developers wont be wasted on picking up the broken disc from the garbage bin.",0

"I avoided this noobfest for a long time. I don't like Activision and don't want to support them financially. Along with EA, they are all that's wrong with the gaming industry. Finally, when it was $5 on sale, and I had done my google research to find that you COULD play on dedicated servers thanks to a community made mod. So I gave in and bought it. But then Activision decided that it was not OK for people to play their game on better servers, and shut it down. I should have known better.",0
"The game is very fun and an older cod that brings back memories... But the multiplayer system is hacked. I would have about 80 hours right now... but I just wasted my money buying a game that doesn't have multiplayer. If you are in a lobby with hackers, you'll most likely get banned. I could go on but this isn't worth it.",0
"i do not recommend this game, because in multiplayer there could be a hacked server resulting in unlocking EVERYTHING, for some people its AWESOME, but not to me because it just ruins the point in multiplayer with unlocking everything altogether, so i would like a refund because of that, thats the reason for MY refund",0
Shooter on rails,0
no server browser so cant play mods well. also you join some american servers so the internet cant keep up and ping is bad,0
Pretty hight price for a forgotten child of IW. Game has no dedicated servers and instead they run on a players connection. Every match lags and host changes are frequent. I still play it cause of the nostalgia.,0

5/10 Okay game in my opinion at the time. It did not do much to stand out with all the shooters that came out around the same time frame. For that it got 'average'. I prefer the realism and gameplay of Battlefield over this shooter. There are newer versions out there so I (if this was the only option for me) would skip this and get the newer CoD that has more 'realism' and overall better feel. Plus more people are playing online on the newer one and more players = better match making leading to a happier gamer :),0
"made me realise just how much better console gaming online is. PC gamer's will never understand how crippled their online gaming experience is compared to consoles in the competitive heartbeat shooter genre.   Games like this, Halo and Gears back in the xbox 360 days were far ahead of their time when it came to accessability [leaderboards, bonus perks, prestiege] and the tools needed for effective communication [party chat, all mics in game] were certainly there unlike the pc.   More importantly, it just feels like a quick console port, a downgraded product of what it should have been and that's exactly what it is.  It's puzzling that for a platform with superior hardware for the same game, the experience is just so miles apart. Console gaming really is better for online shooters. This game is by far one example of that.   Console Gaming- 1  PC hardware- 0",0

The negative aspect out of the way, this is still the same old MW2 you played years ago. It plays just the same &amp; when you DO get into a noraml server, it's loads of fun! I've never had any issues getting into full servers either, so it's got that going for it.   As far as hackers &amp; modders goes, I have never personally came across one, or if I did, I didn't notice. It's just the modded servers you have to watch out for. Play on those to long &amp; you could get slapped with a VAC Ban!  All in all this is a good game, but i really wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than die hard MW2 fans, or people trying to complete their CoD collection. It's a dying game! Yes it will ALWAYS have a player base, (mainly the hardcore MW2 fans) but if you're just getting into PC gaming, or looking for a new FPS, I would tell you to buy Call of Duty 4 instead. There are 4,000+ ACTIVE servers in that game &amp; the number of active players grow every day!",0
Keeps crashing its a peice of ♥♥♥♥ ,0
don't make the same mistake i did nobody plays this game on multiplayer anymore so basically all you have is a 3 hour campaign and special ops that basically suck,0
"it was good until i was slapped with a VAC ban. i wound up with 0.8 hours on record from starting out, and now I can't even play it online. i did nothing at all, so I wasted the 20-30 bucks for nothing. if you want to play this game, you should do it on console personally, unless you can make a private match and keep hackers out. this one was the best one to me and i feel ♥♥♥♥♥ over this.",0
I sunk an unhealthy amount of time into this game and truly enjoyed the competitive nature of it. Unfortunately the game became overrun with cheaters and Activision seemed more interested in churning out DLC rather than fix the problem. Because of that I cannot recommend this game and in fact have never played a COD game again.,0
dont buy this barely anyone play this and there are sometimes modder and there no mods to make this game better,0
U can get banned randomly permantly when u did nothing wrong i dont recorment it,0
♥♥♥♥,0
It was fun till the moderaters start to kick players with tubes and other stuff now I don't like it that mutch anymore,0
"'still rocks. no ded. servers but still better than BlackOps.' - Thats been my Review... until now.  Dont get me wrong, this game is awesome and I love playing Multiplayer. Oh wait. I loveD. But since they sued '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥net' and '4deltaone', which did a pretty great job with developing some modification for this game (New Gamemodes, New Maps, Dedicated Servers...) it just got horrible.  Sorry InfinitiyWard - but your policies really suck. No one buys this game anymore. No one plays it anymore. So why do you even care if somebody makes it playable for the last remaining fans?  'Black Ops' was the last CoD I bought after MW2 - and I did regret it - it felt like playing in mud... But those lawsuits against 4deltaone make it clear: CoD is dead (for me!), I will switch to Battlefield, DayZ and ArmA. R.I.P. CoD, its been a great time. ;)",0
"It is a good game, but i can never get in a lobby with out a hacker! way to many hackers, the MOST u should get it for is around $10 $15. 6.5/10",0
"Well the story was deacent. My biggest problem with the game is that in any given fire fight whoever shoots first will almost always win. there is too much recoil from being shot that there is no chance to get returing fire on the targate. Also, the number of enemies in each fire fight just seems wierd, there are never less than 20 enemies to kill at a time, for one person that is just not right, it makes the game feel fake.",0
"This game used to be amazing in the past. I'm here to write a more accurate up to date review as of August 2014. This game is complete garbage now, with Call of duty 4 still having 10x the playerbase, this game has a flat 300 players for its playerbase, half the games are still to this day filled with hackers, and not to mention errors that this game comes with as soon as its installed, its a shame this game has gone to ♥♥♥♥, do not make my mistake and purchase this garbage, if you want something worth your money, call of duy 4 is still an amazing gem.",0
"Any Call of Duty in the series will tear you apart. How you may ask? Well, Let's just say 'vocab', and rage. That is what I best describe this game. Also, this will tear your family apart as well.",0
"Got banned, kind of expected this because of all of the ♥♥♥♥ing hacked lobbys",0
Now im banned for nothing really ♥♥♥♥♥ WORTH PLAYING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OR 3DM GAME THAN BUYING BUT BANNED FOR NOTHING,0
The multiplayer is full of hackers. It is also isn't really built for PC gaming in mind.,0
Good until hackers ruined it.,0
No player s online free-for-all ??!!,0
10/10 wouldn't recommend,0
"I like it, exept this is how it is:  me:Lets play some MW2!!! person: lets play MW2 and make someone mad! me:SOOO CLOOSE TO RANK UP!!!!! person: lets make him max rank! me:NOOOOO!!!!  so... in the end... i am like prestige 5 because of hackers.",0
"A great game left to decompose.   As much as I enjoy playing this time to time, there are a few reasons why you shouldn't get into it. That's all up to you to decide however.  First, the good:  1. Fairly adult playerbase, I guess mainly because most are the original players from the day.  2. I haven't played Campaign in many years, in fact since I completed it, about 5 years ago, but I remember it was pretty good. 3. Fastpaced multiplayer action.  4. This game doesn't attempt at stealing all your freetime like some other games do, it's fun, but not addictive. 5. This works on Mac, I am not sure if other CoDs don't, but one of my friends recently bought this because it was Mac compatible.   Now the bad:  1. Hackers. It wasn't always nearly as bad as it is now. I am not sure how it works exactly, but InfinityWards seems to not have updated their anticheat system for a few years now and just about any lobby is permiated with a hacker as a result.  2. Unbalanced weapons. I'd guesstimate that 65% of all players use UMP, which is a clear sign your game isn't very well balanced. Some things like reloading on the Intervention has clearly been artificially slowed down, to balance stats out I guess, but still, it's not pretty and it stands out a country mile.   3. It's bloody expensive! I mean, this is 2015 we are living here and this came out in 2009 and it costs 20 USD, which isn't far off what it was at time of its release, I am thinking 7-10 USD maybe? I know it's CoD and CoDs must be expensive by law, but still... If you are going to have a 6 year old game still available for purchase, maybe make it more appealing by offering it at a lower price?  4. Playerbase is small, as You would expect, you'd have to work out the hours when most people come on, otherwise tough luck getting into a SnD when there's like one lobby hosted in the world.   5. Motherf***ing Kicktool! I am not quite sure where IW's common sense was when they allowed people to use that thing, my guess is that this supposed to let people rid of hackers, well no, usually it's used by a-holes to rid off people they cannot outskill. Very quite dissapointing.   I would pass on buying this if I were you, I am sure there are better options for your 20 USD.",0
"Better than mw3 multiplayer in all aspects, and if u have a ♥♥♥♥ pc is better too, mine works mw3 at 50fps and mw2 in 80 fps, buy it.  30/november/2013: DONT BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥, IS FULL OF HACKERS OMG.",0
"Ingame Settings are so bad you can't change FOV or open console, its locked at what looks like 55 making unplayable while sitting at a deks",0
"Okay let me first start off with saying this... This game is NOT worth $20!!!!!!! If you're really wanting to get this game, please do yourself a favor &amp; wait until Steam puts it up for sale. May be a while down the road, but I imagine they will eventually.  Having played this game for several hours, I have gotten into several modded servers. Granted, getting into a normal server was as easy as backing out &amp; searching again, but the thing is, this game sees like 600-800 players MAX on a good day. So you're not always going to be able to back out &amp; get into a normal server. You will sometimes back out &amp; then just rejoin the same modded server.  The negative aspect out of the way, this is still the same old MW2 you played years ago. It plays just the same &amp; when you DO get into a noraml server, it's loads of fun!

"Valve Anti-Cheat enabled :DDD its a joke... lot of cheater, lol respawn system, good game with lot of sux thing.... now ~unplayable:D good game, but now i think i waste 25euro...",0
"Not Dank enuff for me too hard to 360noscope, not MLG!    But seriously the only people playing are haxors and the game is a poor port.",0
"The campaign is short and boring with a boring plot and the multiplayer is extremely unbalanced and all the new features break the game furthermore. So you can customize your killstreak loadout, okay but a lot of them are broken and one killstreak is called the Care Package and it takes 3 kills to get. With only 3 kills you can get a freaking AC-130 and cut up the enemy team. The worst killstreak is the nuke as it instantly ends the match. There's a barragement of overpowered and underpowered weapons, the ACR wrecks all enemies and the M16 might as well not be there. The map design is horrid, offering infinite opportunities for camping. There's also deathstreaks which can increase your health, give you your killer's loadout, etc.  Then there's the community; teenagers claiming to have sexual relations with your mother, idiots who tell you to kill yourself because you're the host and the game is laggy without them realizing that the netcode is horrid, people who run around the map quickscoping/trickshotting instead of playing the game, people who intentionally make their loadout overpowered, etc.   It's a blitzkrieg of flawed game design and you shouldn't spend your money on it.",0
"Even tho its been about forever since I played this poor excuse to be called a game. I still feel I have to report it.... The Multiplayer SUCKS. nothing but lame hackers who are insanly trying to compensate what they are lacking tho I have to stay clean and not say what they are lacking. Even if Hacking isn't the problem... and it, itself is what broke the game... the ridiculous Unbalance and kill streak rewards that are nothing but I win Buttons with stupid over powered AI aircraft and choppers will certainly take anything remotly fun away.  Ofcourse their are alot of people that love that play style which I have to respect. What I can not understand, is how people keep buying these series of COD, expecting them to add some kind of anti hack engine when you know after so many series they havn't and never will. Those people I will always call insane.   I hate this game so badly I wish I can remove this game from my library... NOT ASKING for Refund! I knew I will hate this game when I bought it long time ago... I just did out of peer pressure to play with my friends, so it is clearly my fault for buying it. I just simply want to get rid of it out of my Library permently like I never bought it.",0
"Not the best game to play if you want to play a FPS. Single player is quite bad and short, multiplayer is a non-strategical mode, just shoot and respawn and shoot more while being shot by 15-y-o kids who are screaming at his mic (and in fact are better at shooting and screaming than you).  Buying it for 25 euros was a waste of money and I regret it. Even if it was 5 euros, I'd be upset.",0
"Game was fun until the removal of the 4D1 client. Now it's ♥♥♥♥. No mods, no FoV slider ingame, just a joke of a PC game.",0
"I played the heck out of this way back in the day, but these days there's newer and better games to spend time and money on. Look for one of the newer Call of Duty games or some of the free-to-play games emulating it.",0
don't buy this game if you value your integrity. It's mindless garbage.,0
Better save your money and buy something less money wasting my friend!,0
I bought the game for mac and when i start it 5 sec later it froze plz help,0
"So I was playing with my friends, and I knew one of my friends were cheating. But I didn't care about what he did and I just wanted to play because it was fun. So after some days he got VAC banned and we laughed at him. And the day after, I got VAC banned too...I have no idea why I got banned. Was it because I played with my friend that cheater or? The only thing I have to say now is ♥♥♥♥ OFF MW2",0
"If youre gonna buy this for multiplayer, like i did, dont bother now because i played 5 games and every single one had been hacked to extremity and unplayable so STAY THE ♥♥♥♥ AWAY!!! Unless you bought it for campaign or spec ops or just generally enjoy having a srsly ♥♥♥♥ed kd and not spawning at all :D Enjoy!",0
"This game is Good but not great. First off the muliplayer is a mess, in many ways it adds onto and improves on cod4's  mechanics (such as customible killstreaks and pro perks as well as more weapon diversity). But on the other hand you have  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like one man army noob tubes, commando, deathstreaks, Akimbo G18, and danger close that ruin the games balance and enjoyment.    The single player campaign is good and tells a compelling story but there are some things that aren't well explained and can leav you confused. The spec ops mode is just the campain exept with coop, fun, but doesen't really hold your attention for that long so feel free to skip it. But what hurts this game the most is the optimization, never in my life have I ever seen a game so effortlessly ported to the pc. The game is locked at nauseating 65 FOV (field of view) which will automatically makes the game feel weird to play since you are essenially staring through a pair of binoculars, thankfully there is an FOV changer that you can download for the muliplayer so make sure to get that if you ever plan on getting this game. Plus there are, get this, NO DEDICATED SERVERS.   Yep, no dedicated servers, basic pc features are non exsistent in this game! The lack of dedicated servers is what killed this game, instead of dedicated servers we get a crappy host based matchmaking system where everyone has to leech off of one guys connection meaning if the host has a bad connection you will have to play with laggy hit detection for the rest of the match. Oh and who can forget the oh so wonderful host migrations? Also the game is filled with hacked lobbies up the wazoo and some of them automatically rank you up to level 70 and give you everything ruining most of the replay value. Overall Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a disapointment and don't let any fanboy convince you that it isn't. I wouldn't recommend this game due to the how many asinine descisions were made with the port. But if you are still intrested in getting the game then be my guest, maybe you will be more satisfyed by what you got then I did.",0
"I like to be somewhat aware of what's going on in gaming, and this is the biggest series of them all, but the premise of this is beyond stupid. Not to mention it's like a ride at a theme park - lots to look at, but just keep running...",0
"I would give the game a good and honest opinion on it, however there are too many hackers that aren't being taken care of. You either get kicked or get all your perks and weapons demoted. Unless you really enjoy the game and is willing to earn all your guns and perks back after getting demoted at least once a week, then this is the game for you.",0

"Multiplayer is broken, don't bother. They're not going to fix it any time soon. If you play CoD games solely for the single player campaign, then whatever, but if you play CoD just for the multiplayer, you'll find that you'll enter a hacked lobby and you'll have your UI messed up and that the game will be totally unplayable and it won't matter if you reinstall the game because the problem will persist.",0
"I always loved MW2 yet on PC it isn't good. I would reccomend this game to someone when it first came out but now just save your money. Almost every game you join there is a hacker in the lobby ruining the game. I was hoping to play it legitly but that was not going to happen. The minute I left I was 10th Prestige and level 70. Ontop of that this game issued a VAC ban on my profile for 'cheating'. The reason being is that I installed a custom weapon camo. Nobody else could see it so it was only changing my expirience, not theirs. Its funny how all the millions of hackers on this game get off the hook for hosting lobbies and using aimbot and the minute I use a simple weapon camo I am banned. From a game that came out in 2009 VAC bans should really be a thing of the past. If you want the game for the campaign go ahead but forget about the multiplayer. Its time is over and now modders are in every lobby.",0
"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a 2009 first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. The game is a sequel of the hit game, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare however it did not live up to the original. In my opinion the franchise started to do very poorly from here. Every COD game started to feel like copies with different maps and guns but the same engine. One of the biggest issues were that if you got a certain amount of kills in a row you can nuke the game and your team wins even if your team was losing and the other team was about to win. In theory it only take the effort of one person to win the round.",0
"My time played on record only shows single player activity, as STEAM separates the two (single and multiplayer). My total time played in Multiplayer is 970 hours.  Update: Now that the game is infested with hackers, I can no longer recommend it. It isn't a rare to end up in a hacked lobby which will do anything from deranking you to altering your unlocks to changing settings in your mp config file. Playing the game requires keeping backups of all your stats and MP files. More information about this can be found in the forums, so if you are considering the game at this point, be sure to inform yourself about all of the serious issues affecting it. It may not be worth the hassle.  Is the game playable and fun? Sure. And in some instances, when you find a good host and players who want to have an enjoyable time without noob tubes, commando, or other nonsense, it can be really fun. But just beware, it's infested with hacked lobbies, people running exploits, and a less than respectable community. If you can stomach all that, you can find fun in it.  *Original Review:  Quick pacing and nonstop action keeps you moving forward to the inevitable end game of the single player at around a 5 to 8 hour completion time. This is good if you are looking to jump into playing an hour or so at a time as each chapter of the campaign is relatively short. The action on display is compelling and the thrilling score, outstanding militaristic dialogue, and visceral imagery keep things constantly engaging. The story, as epically scaled as it may be, is a little too contrived. Modern Warfare 2 decides to up the ante with a full scale invasion of the United States. The U.S. is under siege and the stakes are high. It is unfortunate then that the reasoning behind the whole ordeal, while tragic, is somewhat farfetched. The multiplayer is excellent, yes, with superb shooter mechanics and fluid gameplay. It is also somewhat rage inducing. Prepare to be noob tubed to kingdom come. That aside, it is fast and great fun.",0
"Tp be real I have no idea why they say this is the best cod game of all time, maybe in sales. The game is ok, the multiplayer is crap because everyone is cheating, and not just a little, a whole lot, and no one gets kicked,to me it is the worst call of duty ever.",0

"Requires almost no skill and is riddled with DLC and probably still is with hackers.  If you've played one of them, you've played all of them. Save yourself the grenade spam and skip CoD. There are far better games in this genre and recent CoD/Battlefield titles are definitely not one of them.",0

"The best COD game I've played. Singleplayer is great, but the multiplayer sucks, just about everyone hacks in one way or another, and most games are modified or changed in some way. Waste of money.",0
"I really hate having to put a game down due to it's community. I really do. But in the case of MW2, if your in it for the multiplayer, don't buy this game. If you want a decent campaign, then consider picking up this game. Here is why.   Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a modern-day first person shooter, but I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you that. MW2's campaign is probably the last good campaign that Infinity Ward made. It isn't fantastic by any means, but it is still good, and instead of making it a headache to play, like MW3, IW made it fun, and creative, and MW2's campaign is enjoyable for those reasons. Maybe you won't be captivated by the story, but running through diverse enviroments shooting every enemy in sight is pretty fun, and it never really gets mundane. I can recommend the game for the story. But now, onto the multiplayer.   Where MW2 falls is in it's multiplayer. Now, multiplayer used to be amazing. The game provided sparse enviroments with cool guns and the same great game modes, and it was fun. Now, the game still has all that, but now it sucks. Why? Because, hackers. Unfourtunately, like all old games, MW2 took a turn for the worst, and the game is infested with hackers. Most servers are modded, and not in the good way, so the second you enter a match, you will have a Dorito's logo shoved in your face and some reference to weed. None of this is fun, and due to this, the experience is ruined. If you are looking for a good CoD multiplayer experience, I definately recommend Black Ops 2, it is probably the best Call of Duty to date. Again, I hate criticizing a game due to it's community, due to a group of sour apples, but I feel like this cannot be overlooked.   Overall, at one point, MW2 thrived, and it was amazing, and the multiplayer was awesome, and while the single player might still be good, multiplayer is just a shell of it's former self, and I cannot recommend this game because of that.",0

"The PC Port for this game is TERRIBLE!  1.Thanks to it now having the match making system, you can get put in hacked lobbies, which happens a lot! 2:There are no dedicated servers which means if you want to make a server for everyone to join, can't do that anymore 3:There is no more Server Browser, which means you can't choose what game to join, which means you can't join a non hacked game I mean the game is fun and all when you not in a hacked lobby, but with these 3 main problems, I just really can't enjoy this game.

"This is a pitifully disgusting game now. ruined by hackers and little kids. hell both i should say. shameless lag switchers, aimbotters, wallhackers, hacked servers. Hackers killed this franchise because they have no skills and choose hacks to be better.

But it is nice to find that one rare match where no one is actually hacking and its a non hacked lobby and acceptable connection, thats when the beauty of the game truly shines through. i dont recommend you buy this game, but you can if you want. i just bought it for old times sake because i had it on PS3.",0
"When I was younger I really enjoyed this game. I enjoyed the campaign. I enjoyed the multiplayer. I enjoyed the guns. Everything. I guess I grew up, because now the linear campaign feels claustrophobic to the point that it's not remotely enjoyable. The multiplayer still has all the same problems that made people ragequit years ago. Crappy spawn system, terrible hitboxes, ridiculous kill streaks, annoying death streaks, and so much more. I will say that the multiplayer maps themselves are very memorable and it feels good revisiting them. To conclude I don't think this game is worth the 20$ price tag. There are so many better games on here with more to offer that cost less than 20$. So yeah, my opinion.",0

"I used to play this a few years ago and this was a game worth playing. The campaign mode was good, the multiplayer mode was decent and it ran smoothly. I have started playing once more for the past three months and I will admit. I have had enough! The campaign may still be good (although it runs a little slower for me now) but the worst thing about this game is the darn multiplayer.  Allow me to tell you why for this one very good reason in my humble opinion:  It has been hacked to oblivion- I click to play TDM in the game mode selection menu, I wait to be connected to what appears to be a TDM and I somehow land up playing Domination. What makes things worse is that the host can reset the match at the end without allowing you to change up your classes in the after match intervals. This means you go straight back into to domination ON A TDM SERVER CHOICE. This, added with lightning fast quick scopes, grenade launcher addicts, bunny hoppers (people whom jump and shoot/ avoid fire), spawn campers (sitting near enemy respawning places to get easy kills) and the aimbots makes for a very unpleasent gaming experience.   While Treyarch/Activision and ect will have likely to have been furiously working away to conjure a new way to make the public £100 poorer with a sequal to a previous title, they have been forgetting to make sure that their older releases are still being maintained for the enjoyment of hardcore loyalists to the older games that were released. No anti-hack updates or PunkBuster equivilent software has been created to stave away the hackers which suck the joy out of everything.  This may be irrelevant now as no one will be buying this or caring anymore. However I hope the developers are aware that yes, there are still people who play the older games and unfortunately people sad enough to hack them also (probably because they are better than the recent ones i.e Ghosts and Advanced Warfare in my opinion are enormous piles of rubbish trying to keep up with Halo). Getting back to this game, I would not recommend it because of how frustratingly terrible the game has become to even attempt to play. If you want to be hounded by the feinds listed above then go for it, but not for me as I have had my fill and so with that I conclude by saying: consider yourselves warned.",0
"Got into a modded lobby, got prestige 10, level 70 and EVERYTHING unlocked, and then got VAC banned, wouldn't recommend to anyone",0
Nobody plays it................,0
"Honestly don't buy it if you want to get a lot of time out of it and play multiplayer. Youtubers and reviews all said that multiplayer has a ton of hackers that will hurt your steam/computer and even some take out all exit functions. So I didn't play multiplayer, which is a large part of the game. I got about 10 hours out of this game before getting bored of it, and five of which were campaign and the other five special ops. Campaign is much better. Special ops is pretty fun, but it can be annoying trying to get new missions by playing the ones you hate. Overall, save the $20 and go buy Cs:go or Cod4 (which has multiplayer thats not hacked as much)",0
Back in the day I would have suggested this game. I spent crazy hours playing Multiplayer Online. It's such a shame that the PC version multiplayer is dead now. I hear that Xbox is still alive. The single player was fun but short. Bad Company 2 was my next FPS and I enjoyed the single player more.         RATE:   3 OUT OF 10     ,0
"The lack of dedicated servers really hurts the game, if you get into a hacked lobby you'll get VAC banned, plus nobody plays it, if you plan to buy this, please don't; if you are doing it for 'da ztory', just get another shooty game with a good story (may I recommend Bioshock Infinite?).  tl;dr fon't buy this, ever.",0
"This is where Call of Duty began its long decline. Single player (as most of the game in this series) is good and fascinating and multiplayer HAD its good moments (TDM and S&amp;D) but the matchmaking system is really bad. As soon as Black Ops got released this game pretty much died and survives only with hackers dominating servers. I would buy this game now only for &lt;10€ for its single player part (if you liked Call of Duty 4, which is still largely played and the best Call of Duty ever in my opinion)",0
do not buy MW2 if you want to play multiplayer thar to tuns of hackers i onley played 5 hours and got my leveo hacked 2 time and was in mor than 10 hacked lobbys i wood not buy MW2 for multiplayer,0
if the game didnt contain mods and it had dedicated servers it would be fine,0
Guys i Download this game but how i change language from russia to english Pls need help,0

TERRIBLE DONT BUY IT,0
In my opinion? Not worth the money,0
"Lobbies have nothing but hackers. If your looking for the game you played on your 360/  Ps3 then this is not it. It's just hackers, who can't be killed. Infinite health, 1 shot kill water guns. If you like hackers here's your game. If they annoy you then do not purchase this game.",0
"To be totally honest, this game is not worth the money. Even on sale it's not worth it at all. The multiplayer is FULL of hackers. The only thing that's fun is the campain and the special ops but that can only last you so long. You join a game in multiplayer and you get all this op stuff... It takes away the fun and experience in leveling up. So you should hold on to your money and wait for another game you want to go on sale. Hope this helped '')",0
"first of all, COD on Steam? nope. dont bother &gt;-&lt; there are hackers evreyehere. its a hacker paradise. just get this game on xbox 360 and its not bad. mW2 is a decent game, but not on steam. the campaign is playable and spec-ops is pointless scince you cant unlock any other missions ._. oh and   Xxx_MLGFaZeCLAN360PU$$YDESTROYER_xxX  dont forget the dew and doritos.",0
"single player thumbs up co-op thumbs up multi-player lan thumbs up  Multi-player with Valve's anti cheat two thumbs down. The multitude of cheaters and hackers that run rampat on there servers leaves me with no faith in any of steams anti cheat systems. If at very least you had the ability to ban a person to letting join a game your in, you could at least avoid some of them.  Can happen often you join a hacked server, leave it trying to find another game and you join right back into the same server. Valves anti-cheat says it bans cheaters and catchest them however many times its very obvious the cheaters are there and wrecking any entertainment you would have. Unfortunatly if you wish to play lan games and you would like to use more then the basic weapons attachments perks etc. you are forced to play with these poor servers and players with hacks and cheats running. Some of these hacks are minor however most are disruptive (like people deciding to summon boxes and create walls or houses, others try to not be so obvious only using target assist creating multiple increadable kills only seen in movies, some of these are hard to determine because some good players abound with impressive kills and you have to experience multiple incredable deaths untill you can assume there is some hack running. The worst is when someone hijacks a server creating bizzare events of people jumping increadable heights and weapon crates falling from the sky.  The old school way of allowing people to host and control there own network games was far superior there you would be able save servers that were running things fair or in settings you appreciate, and the server controllers could at will ban players they felt were not following there own rules and or seamed to be cheating.  Valves attempt at elliminating cheaters is iether forgotten about with this old game, which leaves me wondering if any of the newer games I may be on the fence of purchasing is worth the hassel of purchasing.  the VAC and forced playing multiple online games before it open weapon options during lan are the only negative to this game,",0
Too many hackers.,0
Steam took it away from me after about a week for no reason i Called them and they said we cant allow a game like this is out web.site,0
this game so old there was only 2 dorietos flavors when it was made,0

Too many hackers i got V.A.C. banned becase of them,0
Very good game but to many hackers...i don't want play anymore...Nobody protect us from hackers!!,0
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was the most popular Call of Duty of all time. It has an engaging campaign and the visuals at the time were top notch. But its glory days have passed. The multiplayer is riddled with hacks and it is almost impossible to find an unhacked server. So if you are looking at this game for the multiplayer then I would look elsewhere. If you are looking at this then I would wait until the price drops but until then I cannot recommend this game simply because of its age and non working service.,0
"This game is good in gameplay and all that stuff, but there is one thing that makes the game unplayable, hackers.  Now, I'm not talking about aimbot or some lame exuse when I get killed or something like that. I'm talking about LEGIT hackers/moders.   Almost EVERY multi player server you go on, it will be hacked. I can't even PLAY the game anymore because some hacker put this GIANT MAP in the middle of my screen! Even if I restart the game it's still there.  They also have acess to your LOADOUTS too, and some hacker took ALL my items from me.  Would I recommend this? Well, maybe. If you don't mind all the hacking and taking away all your items and giant maps on the screen. Just maybe.",0
"Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was good when it came out.  Now it is just sad. With all those hackers and their hack servers sending you to prestige 10, when you wanna level up yourself and earn all those things.  i managed to get prestige 4 before getting into a hacked server which turned me into prestige 10.  So i've done my fair share of resetting. But then i got tired of resetting every now and then and eventually stopped playing.  Back in the day i would score it 10/10 but today i will probably score it 3/10",0
"The multi-player is hacked to pieces. If you don't have enough friends to host your own site, forget about it.",0

this game with no offline split screen on pc is preety much useless. console version much better with it ...,0
"Great game dont get me wrong! I love this and would still be playing.. But stupid hackers are every where! My friend is now banned from modern warfare 2 because we were in a hacked lobby. YES, the hacker was fine, but not the innocent.. such bull****. He didnt hack yet he was banned. Good job VAC!!!!!!!!!! GOOD F****** JOB. Good game, non existent, I Bought it for PS3 recently too and hackers are there too. Sadly not worth the money",0
This game is broken multiplayer is full of a ♥♥♥♥! and players are idiots they make this game full of ♥♥♥♥ everybody are using guns what are OP like G18 akimbo Granade launcher and that is ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculus and this game is full of hackers dont buy this if u rage much,0

"With nearly a thousand hours played in Singleplayer and Multiplayer it makes me sad to give this a negative review now. I loved this game. I used to play this all f****n day long after school with my friends and even made new friends.   It used to be the best game I ever played but now it's literally dead except for hackers, campers and ofcourse trolls. To bad that the newer games don't give the same feeling like this one did. I guess it's time to say goodbye and finally uninstall it.  May my memory of this game stay always in my mind and the pure joy that I felt, shall stay in my heart. RIP &lt;/3",0
+Co-Op  -Re used maps from 'old' cod 'games'  +Singleplayer takes some time to complete.  -Get's repedetive.  -Still no FoV option. -Server browser is only avible if you cracked your game wich is not legal. (Makes me wonder why the ♥♥♥♥ pirates get's the beter Version?!?!)  ,0
"do not buy, even though this game is amazing. the online is unplayable due to the lack of players. 90% of the time you will join hack matches, i really wish the devs could do something about the hackers. but they are no going to do that beacause its an 'old game'. i recommend this game for the story. :(",0

"Used to be a great game, Multiplayer that is. Now its just crap and full of stupid mods. Its no fun anymore.",0
"Well the bad thing is there are so MANY hackers and if they get VAC Ban, they just make new account and share their library.. so they can get back on and hack again easily so I think the anti cheat should work better to stop the hackers from ruining the game I stopped playing MW2 and barely play it because of hackers. GOOD THING: It's cheap, great game but just too many hackers. Hope this helped. If you get this game I recommend just playing single player and on servers with no hackers.",0
"Yes I am a little behind the times , its a old game . But the people that play this game are the most rude and racisit assbags I have ever met . I play two games on steam so far , killing floor which by far has the most likeable players I have ever met , even made friends with a few but this game , I really regret buying it . Oh it had great graphics , but that is about it . Way to confusing for a first timer plus no way that I found so far to balance the game play . I get tossed into a game with level 70 players I may as well just stay in one spot and be target practice . Maybe MW3 is better but I do not think the price on either of these games just because of the community is worth it . If I want abuse I will go and find a girlfriend into bondage , not some 20 something neckbeard who had played the game forever . Just wish I vould get my money back .",0

"For it's $20 dollar price tag it's probably one of the best choices for Call of Duty's out there. The main problem being is that there's a large amount of hackers in the game, or hacked lobbies. Still, you you want an occasional Call of Duty game to play, this might be a good pick up.",0
"Single Player:   Pros:  Simple. Clean. Fun. Fun missions that are well designed and complex. Game mechanics are an improvement compared to COD 4.  Cons:  Terrible Storyline. Get's boring. I can only play it for like 45 minutes in one sitting until I get bored out of my mind.   Multiplayer: Just terrible frankly, almost no one plays it anymore and the ones that do are all hackers. No point in playing it.  Conclusion: Decent game, but you're probably better off playing a different COD, such as Black Ops or any of the more recent ones (Ghosts, Advanced Warfare), or waiting for BO3 which looks pretty damn good.  Overall - 6.5/10",0
"This game was piece of art when it first came out, so many improvements from Call of Duty 4. The campaign for Modern Warfare 2 was an absolute masterpiece, you continue on from Call of Duty 4, playing as different branches, with different characters, though this game does have it's moments being a bit repetative later on in the game but something new always pops up to give you a boost of interest, the graphics for this game are amazing, huge step up from COD4, the AI is improved but still has it's moments where it is completely unintelligent and has no regard for itself, animations are great, many weapons throughout the campaign to choose from, the singplayer earns a 9/10. As for the multiplayer I cannot say the same, let me start off saying that Modern Warfare 2 is only worth playing for it's singeplayer due to the fact that the multiplayer is full of hackers all day everyday, and you can risk being deranked in a specific server, that goes with saying you can be at risk for a VAC ban for claims of cheating, the multiplayer is nice and all, lot's of intense fighting, however the hackers are the main reason why multiplayer is ruined for this, so I do not recommend this game for it's multiplayer.",0
Beware bloody game won't let me bloody finish its Endgame; and in effect its Single Player.,0

too many hackers and noob tubes in this game and all the legit players can do nothing about it because valve is too ♥♥♥♥ing stupid to fix the game to ban hackers,0

"Note: the following is about the single-player version. I don't play multiplayer so cannot comment on it. If you're buying it for the multiplayer, look at other reviews. If you're considering buying it for the single player, this review is meant for you. FYI.  It's so scripted that there is little to no replayability unless you enjoy doing exactly the same thing over and over and are enamoured with learning what is effectively an elaborate dance routine (shoot there, spin around, shoot there, move 2 meters, shoot there, etc.). So $/hr of enjoyment is limited. Lucky I only buy these things at massive discount Steam sales.  Overall storyline is strained. On the plus side, many of the missions are somewhat entertaining the first time around. Some are annoying as hell, apparently made to simply annoy the player, or perhaps showcase a particular element that the developers were particular proud of. None made me think 'wow, that was great'. The ending was, as with CoD4:MW, an annoying as hell tightly scripted cutscene.  Will I get the CoD:MW3? Probably, but only at a massive discount (ie: under CDN$10). Because so far the series isn't worth more than that. But for $10, it's an OK buy.  PS: You can't even turn off the repetive music. Instead, you'll have it blaring your ears while you TRY to listen for the killer dogs approaching, or footsteps behind you. There are ways to turn it off by hacking the system (well, renaming a file) but that compromises the local file integrity. Go figure.  PPS: Having now tried the multiplayer, my opinion doesn't change. The main issue is their idea of 'server selection'. As in: you don't get a choice. You are connected to the first server it finds, and servers are user-operated so anything can happen. The system does not offer a list of available servers. So if you're in a group you don't want to play with (ie: they've hacked the server so much it's useless), you're stuck, because that's the first one the game will find. Alternative services have been aggressively shut down by the distributor for some reason. As for gameplay, it's the usual mix of perfectly reasonable people with an unfortunate leavening of cheaters.   PPPS: Oh, and if you want to play around in single player, expect a LOT of issues trying to get the console working, and keeping it working. It was working, I 'resumed' a game, and now it's not working any more. Yes, I've made all the necessary changes to config.cfg, yes I've made config.cfg read-only so the damn game doesn't overwrite it with a stored copy (why in HELL have a config.cfg if there's a stored copy, I'll never understand), but it still won't bloody work. ANNOYED! Doesn't change my recommendation though, my opinion of the game was already low.  Definitely not at all recommended unless you get this game at a steep, steep discount.",0

I would like to update my old review from back in 2014 in January 1st.  I'll keep it short by saying that I wouldn't recommend this game.  The singleplayer is fun but what most people are probably after is the multiplayer which this game is not-so-great with - maybe back when it first came out?  I find I'm lagging constantly (with good internet) and the game also seems to crash a lot telling me there are 'file mismaches' to which I've gone and fixed with the validation of game files to which the game STILL tells me that I have mismatched files.,0
The start of the decent of Call of Duty...,0

Filled with whiny ♥♥♥♥♥ with no grasp on ''fun''. They just want 3 digits on their kill column. This might have been fun at it's prime but now it's just cancer.,0
"No dedicated server support in multiplayer. Not only does this mean there is virtually no ability to play on custom user created maps (unless you play locally) but it means you get put in games with no attention to connection issues, skill level or map choice. This one thing alone ruined it for me. If this doesn't bother you I'd say it's a great game, all of what you'd expect from the COD series.

"Simple review, dont buy. Old game that is only played by noobs who just camp and do nothing to play the game. Only game mode played is TDM, which id ont mind but it sucks when you try to get into the foray only to be shot in the back by a guy corner camping. Oh and no lean ability, Infinity Ward removed it because a minority of the gaming community hated it cause the campers couldnt camp with it. Unbalanced perks, weapons and equipment like the UMP45 getting a massive boost with the suppressor and OMA giving unlimited grenade ammo for the noob tube and such. Hacking is still present though most people using it will hide it by pulling it out limitedly and the fact that VAC no longer bans players from the game which basically makes the game now garbage. Hosting is archaic with having a player host in a sort of LAN based gaming which you dont control, its like console gaming on a PC. If you have latency to the host expect to lose alot of .. everything gunfights, matches and basically even when you shoot guys in the back expect that to fail when it doesnt register and you still die. Even being host doesnt guarantee anything since you can still lag when hosting too. No control over the game, no lean ability, no hacker counter equals a game that can still be fun when played with none of the above stuff but when there are hackers and such expect a broken match and to top if off if you leave it will count as a loss and then they will toss you right back into the same match as icing on the cake.",0

Really only pick this up if you have nostalgia from playing it on an old console.",0
So i had some fun with this in multiplayer... until i joined a server and quickly realized it was hacked and i then notice im level 70... so yeah that ruined a big chunk of the game for me and apperantly it happens alot due to my friends first game was hacked from what i know there is no way to avoid these servers but you can always prestige when you stumble upon a hacked server.. However this is not the end i suppose i can still find some enjoyment out of the game after all it is call of duty even if i wish i could get my 10 dollars back... would recomend this game on xbox and play station Not pc,0
"Hackers, do i have to say any more?",0
good game but lot of hackers. ,0
"People still play 4 Game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Hardcore Team Deathmatch and Domination (sometimes you can find Search &amp; Destroy but not usually). Most of the time you won't have a problem with TDM but any other game mode you will be waiting several minutes for Steam to setup a lobby and when you get one it will likely be laggy. I got this game on sale for 10 bucks a couple weeks ago and it was worth it... But I would definitely not recommend paying 20 bucks for this game unless you only like Team Deathmatch.   Oh, and it is full of hackers. If you can deal with people shooting you through walls when they shouldn't even know you're there then this one's for you! I would actually guess that AT LEAST 7/10 people are actually cheating in this game. Since the anti-cheat engine is disabled they don't even try to hide it anymore. Never seen such blatantly obvious hacks in a game before. I rate this game ***Fart noise*** out of 10.  UPDATE! Reverted to Windows 7, had to reinstall the game. Won't even run in Windows 7. I am not converting back to Windows 10 just to play MW2. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOU SAVE YOUR MONEY and don't buy this junk.",0

Activision say that these updates in PC have many technical difficulties, come on...  I'm hopeless about a major update in COD:MW2, so I don't recommend this game because the high prize of this game (even on sale!) doesn't represent the real quality of the game (with respect to PS3/360).",0

I bought this for the single player and both steam and activision will not find or help as to why it won't play in single version so if that is your idea DON'T get it .,0
my game wont load and ive tried many things to fix it but its just not working ,0
too many hackers and noob tubes in this game and all the legit players can do nothing about it because valve is too ♥♥♥♥ing stupid to fix the game to ban hackers,0
"Very good game , when flash bang explosives back to you you get blinded and slowed wtf is this",0
Wtf Patch that ♥♥♥♥ plz noobs I cant play compaing ♥♥♥♥ing noobs!,0

"Game randomly decided not to start after a new steam patch, dont waste your money, go buy the disc at gamestop or from somewhere that will escape you from steam's ♥♥♥♥ service",0
"if anyone asked me for couple of years ago, Ill be recommend it to others, now I dont, too many cheaters in this game, and for sure its really sad, cuz its actually a pretty good game, too bad with the cheating stuff..!",0
"A game for 13 year olds. Boring and linear maps, incredibly imbalanced weapons, and a bad community. Oh, and no dedicated servers, just to screw you over that little bit more. Single player campaign is way too short, multiplayer takes years to get going (and is bad, anyway). Should be in the bargain bin, but they're still charging something ridiculous.",0
"Spawned in got killed 20 times by a aimboting hacker.       Uninstall had no hackers tho, so 10/10 would uninstall again.",0
HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS. But seriously the sensitivity is absolutely terrible for this game as it tries to accelerate all the ♥♥♥♥ing time.,0
Good GAme...but these days every lobby has an cheater hacker with wallhack or aimbot.,0
good graphics for a pc game but mine is now broken,0
The community i just full of people who are old to this game so i reccomend that you dont buy this game after 2013 because youll just keep getting deathstreaks,0
"Great for a call of duty game, but compared to good games it's ♥♥♥♥",0
Don´t look at the negative reviews to find some faults. Go and buy this awesome Call of Duty &lt;3,0
"Thanks for once for not giving me a chance to play with my brother, everytime i wait too ♥♥♥♥ing long for nothing. and when we do find a game it is with a garanteerd with multiple hacker, some sneakyer than the other. this basicly ruins the whole ♥♥♥♥ing idea of owning this game as i did it purely for the multiplayer. thanks for stealing again. because you can't call this ♥♥♥♥ a game anymore",0
So i had some fun with this in multiplayer... until i joined a server and quickly realized it was hacked and i then notice im level 70... so yeah that ruined a big chunk of the game for me and apperantly it happens alot due to my friends first game was hacked from what i know there is no way to avoid these servers but you can always prestige when you stumble upon a hacked server.. However this is not the end i suppose i can still find some enjoyment out of the game after all it is call of duty even if i wish i could get my 10 dollars back... would recomend this game on xbox and play station Not pc,0
"Note: the following is about the single-player version. I don't play multiplayer so cannot comment on it. If you're buying it for the multiplayer, look at other reviews. If you're considering buying it for the single player, this review is meant for you. FYI.  It's so scripted that there is little to no replayability unless you enjoy doing exactly the same thing over and over and are enamoured with learning what is effectively an elaborate dance routine (shoot there, spin around, shoot there, move 2 meters, shoot there, etc.). So $/hr of enjoyment is limited. Lucky I only buy these things at massive discount Steam sales.  Overall storyline is strained. On the plus side, many of the missions are somewhat entertaining the first time around. Some are annoying as hell, apparently made to simply annoy the player, or perhaps showcase a particular element that the developers were particular proud of. None made me think 'wow, that was great'. The ending was, as with CoD4:MW, an annoying as hell tightly scripted cutscene.  Will I get the CoD:MW3? Probably, but only at a massive discount (ie: under CDN$10). Because so far the series isn't worth more than that. But for $10, it's an OK buy.  PS: You can't even turn off the repetive music. Instead, you'll have it blaring your ears while you TRY to listen for the killer dogs approaching, or footsteps behind you. There are ways to turn it off by hacking the system (well, renaming a file) but that compromises the local file integrity. Go figure.  PPS: Having now tried the multiplayer, my opinion doesn't change. The main issue is their idea of 'server selection'. As in: you don't get a choice. You are connected to the first server it finds, and servers are user-operated so anything can happen. The system does not offer a list of available servers. So if you're in a group you don't want to play with (ie: they've hacked the server so much it's useless), you're stuck, because that's the first one the game will find. Alternative services have been aggressively shut down by the distributor for some reason. As for gameplay, it's the usual mix of perfectly reasonable people with an unfortunate leavening of cheaters.   PPPS: Oh, and if you want to play around in single player, expect a LOT of issues trying to get the console working, and keeping it working. It was working, I 'resumed' a game, and now it's not working any more. Yes, I've made all the necessary changes to config.cfg, yes I've made config.cfg read-only so the damn game doesn't overwrite it with a stored copy (why in HELL have a config.cfg if there's a stored copy, I'll never understand), but it still won't bloody work. ANNOYED! Doesn't change my recommendation though, my opinion of the game was already low.  Definitely not at all recommended unless you get this game at a steep, steep discount.",0
It was great with local servers in Australia then the cheap cod owners moved all the mandatory match making servers in asia. If you like constant lag then waste your money on this now ♥♥♥♥ game,0
"You would think that at least one person would have asked a real soldier just how effective a 7.62mm round is against a soldier. This game is stupid. It takes four or five shots to eliminate a target. Can one of these programmers please demonstrate their bullet-proof cotton by standing in front of firing range and taking 5 rounds from a 5.56mm weapon. This is not a game; it'a a movie. It's scripted, it pre-destined, there is nothing the player can do to change the result. Just shoot stuff and wait for the cut-scenes.  By the way, real soldiers never say the word 'repeat' on the radio - the word repeat in an artillery fire order.  The game takes away your choice to move, to see, and to decide.  The game looks good, but it uses the amazing graphics to draw dirt, snow, and blood on your face. A wasted opportunity. It's a movie. The player has no control over the results. The end scene is excrutatingly frustrating as a boring end-of-game movie. Get the cheat codes and play the one-player levels. Disapointing.",0
"I remember playing this game a long time ago when it was the best COD you could play. Everything was just amazing. There were no noobtubers, hackers, little kids and more. I used to play an old alternate online version called ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥net and i remeber i it was the best thing i ever played. Nostalgia got me and I decided to buy a Steam version and I can tell you that I'm really dissapointed. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥net players were very fair and honest and there were no hackers and noobtubers. So i remember joining a server and got noobtubed in the first 5 seconds and I thought it was a joke but later on I realised i was wrong. Maybe 40% of poeple who play this game are fair and normal. Before you start ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on me and saying this is an old game I get that but I can tell you that this game is ruined. Long story short this is a game whose community has gone to ♥♥♥♥.",0
"The singleplayer is great, but if you want to buy this for the multiplayer like I did, don't bother. It's filled with cheaters and last I heard a VAC won't stop the cheaters from continuing playing.",0
"Just played MW2 on 360 again, I hate this now, versus the consoles it's laggy, vacant and has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls and the graphics look like clay.",0
Private matches dont work,0
Multiplayers is full of cheaters.,0
"Can't say this game is all that great anymore. The single campaign is just not gripping and lasts 5 or 6 hours at best. There are still some people playing multiplayer, but you're SOL if you want to play anything other than Team Deathmatch, Free for All, and Search and Destroy. Really only pick this up if you have nostalgia from playing it on an old console.",0
It was great with local servers in Australia then the cheap cod owners moved all the mandatory match making servers in asia. If you like constant lag then waste your money on this now ♥♥♥♥ game,0
there's a lot of hacker ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥in multiplayer,0

5/10 lame propaganda. gameplay itself -get shot just get to cover and you will be good while everyone else is an idiot -runs out and dies from a few shots.,0
This franchise shoud be call of Hacks!!,0
"This Part of the Call of Duty Frabchise was pretty much fun back in the days of its release, nowdays you will most likely only find hacked lobbies &amp; hackers playing online. Still it was much fun to play the first year after release.  Nowdays I would not recommend buying it, only for story mode.",0
"Whos up for talking about the campaign? NO ONE! There was a few nice mission but half way through it started to fell dull. The ending was super bad. Mute everyone in the lobby and hide the chat and youre all good. Try not to play scrapyard, its filled with people who enjoys the tubes. Its aged well.",0
"'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.' A review by Richard Valkinsenn.  EDIT: My original review of Modern Warfare 2 has been updated to reflect my changed opinion of the game. I have a lot to say about it, and not a lot of it's good. The review is now broken up into two sections and will cover the game's campaign and multiplayer suites, respectively.  ---- CAMPAIGN REVIEW ----  Modern Warfare 2 is the pinnacle of the Call of Duty series, second only to it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. Unfortunately, factoring in both the game's single-player and multiplayer suites, that's not really saying much. Campaign-wise, admittedly, Modern Warfare 2's campaign does feature a thrilling, well-acted campaign, and comes packed with thrills and chills, the latter of which is mostly contained in the campaign's notorious 'No Russian' mission. While the campaign's level design is linear, thankfully the player is given a wide variety of roles throughout the game's runtime. One level will feature a tense series of firefights with loads of enemies while another will have the player moving stealthily in a semi-linear fashion from point A to point B. As for long-lasting appeal, somehow, Modern Warfare 2 has a charm that has withstood the test of time.  The campaign also features a co-op mode featuring missions based on scenarios seen not just in Modern Warfare 2 but also it's predecessor, Call of Duty 4. These missions are widely varied and feature time attacks, stealth missions, and other various modes for up to two players to engage in. There are a few missions which require no less than two players, but thankfully, the majority of the missions can be completed solo, if players so desire.  Sadly, while the campaign and co-op modes are pretty solid, as far as a PC port goes, the entire package as a whole is found wanting. For starters, the game's options lack many essential PC features, like a Field of View (FOV) slider. In fact, it seems the developers went out of the way to make it difficult to even edit the native FOV via console or cfg edits. Not to mention the fact that the lack of separated audio sliders makes trying to tailor the game's audio experience to one's liking impossible. What makes it even worse is the lack of mod support, meaning basically that making custom content for the game is something that's just not gonna happen. Above all else, what makes it all even worse is the game's multiplayer suite, which only serves to highlight many of the game's glaring faults.  Campaign Verdict: I liked it.  ---- MULTIPLAYER REVIEW ----  Years ago, I played Modern Warfare 2 on Xbox LIVE and rather enjoyed it. However, having transitioned to the PC in the last several years and having played other, superior online titles, I've found Modern Warfare 2's PC multiplayer suite to be nothing short of a train wreck.  In addition to the glaring lack of an FOV slider, so much power and choice was taken out of the player's hands in this game. Dedicated servers, or at least a server browser for choosing matches is non-existent. Voting to kick or ban problematic players was left out. Mod support for custom content is gone. A much-needed feature like hiding the in-game chat log is just not there. And sure you could host a private match, but hosting a public match with custom rules and map rotations is a thing of the past. Well, unless you hack it in, but then you run the risk of getting hit with a Valve Anti-Cheat ban.  Then you get to the actual gameplay that Modern Warfare 2 has to offer... and it gets a little better and a lot worse from there. While MW2's maps are thankfully not as restrictive as later titles in the overall series, they still suffer from a near-complete lack of interactivity. Not everything about the maps is terrible, however, as they do allow for a multitude of different tactics and approaches, though this also applies to hiding spots and long, open stretches for campers to exploit. As far as the game's arsenal and perks go, there's a lot of room for mixing and matching to create a lot of different approaches and playstyles. At the same time, weapon customization is sadly hampered by the fact that only one attachment is allowed at a time, though a certain perk can allow up to two. However, adding this perk to a loadout means that no other perks in that perk's category can be applied.  Above all else, there's one thing that makes Modern Warfare 2 just about unbearable at any time, and it's an issue that also extends to the entire series, overall. A lot of the methods for getting kills in Modern Warfare 2 require little to no skill to employ. An example would be the addition of quick, one-hit knife kills that can be require little more than a button press, in addition to lethal traps that can be laid for other players. Several of the game's perks also exacerbate this, like a perk that expands the lethal radius for explosives or another that increases the distance over which knife kills apply. Not to mention the fact that the game doesn't treat fired shots like projectiles; once the sights are lined up, bullet hits are instantly guaranteed, no matter the distance.  Overall, while it has many high points, Modern Warfare 2 on the PC leaves way too much to be desired. A glaring lack of much-needed PC features along with an array of lackluster gameplay features sours an online and even offline experience with lots of untapped potential.  Multiplayer Verdict: It could've been much better.",0
"would recommend this game but, untalented/unskillful people, use noobtubes and rpgs. some people play normally, but people use rpgs and noobtubes to carry them to max prestige. ffs",0
Was a PC darling before 2 but 4 then turned it into the most popular video game in the world.,0
"**** TL;DR ALOT OF HACKERS INFINITY WARD/VALVE DONT CARE ANYMORE**** **** ALMOST EVERYTHING IS 'OP' IN THIS GAME THATS HOW IT WAS BALANCED****  Probably my favorite call of duty and ive been playing since launch, but there are ALOT of hackers these days and there are also people that spam grenade launchers all day, and there are people that will DDOS or kick you if they dont like you or you make them mad. It feels like every 3/10 games has a hacker on a GOOD day and it seems to get worse whenever there is a holiday (the kids are off school).Ive had entire nights of trying to play this game and every lobby has a blatent aim botter/wall hacks so i just have to play something else.Why do people hack in a old game like this?  The only time to buy this game in my opinion is when it is at 50% off MINIMUM but i have never seen it go lower than that  so you need to ask yourself: can i deal with hackers,grenade launchers,and possibly modded lobbys all day?  if yes get the game while its on sale and try to enjoy whats left of the game  if no then just skip it and just enjoy the memories of what the game used to be like and go watch a twich stream Kappa  I can not recommend the game in the state that it is in now",0
"Cons. 1. No mics in lobby [i dont get that] 2. auto aimers and modders in search and destroy 3. very small community 4. i've never played campaign on xbox online multiplayer a ton 5. nothing like xbox 6. save your money. had to log 5mins in campaign menu to leave review exposing how horrible yet another COD multiplayer game is trash thanks to modders.  Just played 4 hours of online. Going to uninstall. Bought on sale for $9 and looked to see if anyone was online in the community hub before i bought it. Search and destory is full of modders and auto aimers that you can't report. They talk alot of trash about killing you 0/50 and say 'git gud'  Well i'm asking for a refund, reviewing this game and saying that this along with all of call of dutys old games is full of auto aimers that destroy and completely crap on the emersion.  DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU WANT AUTO AIMERS TO CAMP YOU IN THE SMALL COMMUNITY THEN SAY 'GIT GUD'  also use ^1-9 to color your text and display name.",0
better than the new cods but full of hackers as activion gave up on it after releasing the new crap.,0

"This game is a mess... and let me count the ways.  1. A broken melee system: Postal, true to the franchise, offers many different tools of the trade to dispose of your enemies. And some of the tools include a sledgehammer, machete, fire axe, and something else I can't remember. But none of that matters because the only one that works is the ♥♥♥♥ing machete. It is extremely difficult to land your blow on enemies with other weapons, including your kick, but it doesn't matter because the fire axe and sledgehammer don't even do any damage.  2. Abysmal Gunplay: Would you be surprised if I told you this is the strongest gameplay element? Cuz it is. Is it because it's fun? No. Is it because there's cool weapons? No. It's because guns are pretty much the only gameplay element that functions. A headshot kills any enemy instantly. So, if you don't want to deal with the awfulness of every other tool of the trade, guns are the way to go. And don't bother with the shotgun or the MG. They're both garbage.  3. Awful Humor: Postal 2 got it's humor from satirizing both social issues and video game tropes and controversies. Postal 3 doesn't do this at all. Instead, it goes for stupid humor and shock value. Like terrorists dressing up in giant novelty moustaches and sombreros and sneaking across the US Border. Or firing man juice soaked tissue clumps at Sarah Palin in a porn shop full of men jerking it to monitors. And I'll admit, I laughed a few times, but it wasn't because I thought it was clever. Quite the opposite, in fact. I laughed because it was so utterly stupid and random that it just brought out the inner caveman. And that's the problem; Postal 3 is offensive for all the wrong reasons. There are a few times when the developers want to get tongue and cheeky with you. But it's hard to find it funny when the game keeps kicking your ♥♥♥ every chance it gets. Sorry Postal 3, but you can't kick me in the nads and then give me a piece of cake. It doesn't work that way.  4. What-The-♥♥♥♥ Scale Performance: Do you have a decent gaming rig? Do you have an ultra powerful rig? Well neither matter because Postal 3 is terribly built and optimized. I can run mostly anything on max settings, and yet this game chugs when things get going. And even setting it to low didn't change the performance one bit. It's amazing how you can mess up so bad on an engine designed specifically for non-high end machines.  5. It's Linear &amp; Catharsis Sucks: The entire game has you follow a very narrow path of the dude going about his day just trying to earn some money. And, as you continue, you get to make moral choices that alter which missions you do. This would be fine, if it wasn't Postal. Or, you know, at least done properly. I wanna be free to explore the city and do what I want and attack the story at my own pace. When you beat the game, you unlock the entire city to go around and play in. But when you start it you see just how bad the direction really is. They basically took what they made of the city, and then stitched together the other set pieces from missions into the mix. There's no sense of where you're going at all. It's apparent they did not design a city and split it accordingly. They just made random crap, stitched it together with duct tape, and said, 'Here this is Catharsis.' You know it's bad when you walk up to a highway offramp and end up at the gay rodeo. Oh, yeah, there's a gay rodeo too. If you were expecting more there isn't. That's pretty much the joke. Gay cowboys. Harr harr.  6. Gimmicky Weapons and Assets: Postal 3 showed off a teaser many years ago featuring the Postal dude driving around the city in a segway. They showed this more in the grindhouse trailer they showed at one of the E3 conventions. Guess what? That segway they hyped so much? It's only used in one mission. Yup. One ♥♥♥♥ing mission. Besides the stupid segway, there's other weapons apart from your normal guns and melee weapons you can use to have 'fun.' There's grenades, the gasoline tank, feral cats with super AIDS (???), etc. And all of these suffer from abysmal controls. Thrown weapons like grenades and cats involve holding down one of the mouse buttons, and then pressing the other mouse button while still holding on to the primary fire button. Or something like that. I don't know and I don't care enough to find out. It's that bad that even after 10 hours of this crap I still couldn't get the hang of throwing ♥♥♥♥. Oh, and the gas tank? Useless. Why? Because it's hard as ♥♥♥♥ to pour the gas out over where you want it specifically and it's even harder to throw your ♥♥♥♥ing match on the gasoline you poured out.  7. Loading Screens: This game has some of the worst loading screens I've ever seen. Not only are they insanely frequent, but they take forever too. There's a loading screen to start the intro videos. Then there's another loading screen after that to load the menu. The first launch of a map or first time loading takes 1 minute and 40 seconds (Yes, I timed it) to load. After that, any other loading screens take between 35-40 seconds.  8. The Moral System: I don't mind if a game has a moral system. What I do mind, however, is when you introduce me to the moral system mechanic, teach me what it does and whatever, and then tell me at the end of the game that it doesn't matter. They try to make it a joke towards endgame with Krotchy (who gave you the tutorial in the first place) telling you it doesn't mean anything. And then at the last level they tell you it actually didn't mean anything. So if you thought you were going to get a different ending mission, or ending cutscene, based on your actions then guess what; you don't. This isn't ♥♥♥♥ing funny, Akella. That is a huge slap in the face to your ♥♥♥♥ing player base. Especially when the moral system was one of the features you boasted about in your trailers and even on this very store page.  In short: ♥♥♥♥ this game. ♥♥♥♥ Akella for making it. And ♥♥♥♥ RWS for not making themselves and leaving it in the hands of incompetent jagoffs.",0
Get Postal 2 instead.,0
"Postal and Postal 2 taught me to regret nothing, and I took that to heart.   Then I tried playing Postal 3, and now I know nothing but regret.",0
"Okay, after finally playing the first and second Postal games, I finally decided to give the third installment another shot. Even after learning the backstory of the game (RWS Inc. hired an underfunded and tyrannical game developer company from Russia to code the game), I decided to give it a second chance. Sure, I wouldn't get all the extra little achievements like I did with the first two Postals, but I'd at least beat the game and give it a fair judgment from that, right?  Wrong. I had completely forgotten what it was that had kept me from playing this game in the first place. It wasn't the linear levels (Postal 1 had linear levels). It wasn't the stupid jokes or the weird weapons and minigames (Postal 2 had stupid jokes and weird weapons and minigames). It was the gameplay. Yes, Akeela Software (or whatever they call themselves) had suffered through a Russian economic crash and in suffering fired their competent, cooperative developers and assigned this project to a group of Prima Donnas who not only couldn't correctly string a game together even if it was coming out of their own ♥♥♥, but also deliberately altered the structure of the game against the wishes of RWS Inc. (you know, the people who wrote the game series and own the rights to them and CONTRACTED Akeela TO DO MAKE THE GAME THAT RWS had envisioned!!!). Not only that, but Akeela also refused to release the code to the general public because they didn't want those loyal gamers to make MODs or anything, even though RWS Inc. wanted them to. As a result, the gameplay is sticky, jagged, the graphics go photo-negative after 15 minutes of gameplay and glitches flood this game. For example, I had to restart a level because the game wouldn't let me open a door that was integral to the plot, and the escort mission with the segways was almost impossible. All in all, it kept me from enjoying this game not once but twice, which is a shame, because otherwise, I thought it could have been an enjoyable game.   *SPOILER ALERT* For those still interested in knowing, the game pickups where the second one left off: after detonating Paradise, Arizona with a nuke, the Postal dude drove to the next closest fictional town in Arizona, Catharsis. There, a wealthy Ron Jeremy owns and runs everything with a pretty open mind. The problem is that he's constantly being undermined or even flat out attacked by Eco-terrorists, Al Queda, God-fearing hockey moms (led by Sarah Palin...wait...why is she in Arizona?!) and other satirical and colorful characters. The Postal Dude, just trying to make a buck, is given constant choices as to whose side he is on, or at least which side he wants to flip flop to and from. While the levels are linear, your actions do choose the course of the game. Unlike the last game, the third Postal gives you a Max Payne type of third person layout and aiming system, and you get most of the weapons from the previous game, plus a few new ones like beehives, a shopvac (filled with questionably stained tissues) and the badgersaw.   Like I said, it could have an enjoyable installment to the series, but the Russian contractors completely ruined it to the point that RWS Inc. even tells people to stay away from it.",0
Postal III is a perfect example of what happenes when you let drug-addled russian mod designers handle your beloved franchise. Avoid like the plague.,0
"I spent actual money on this, because I am not a very bright man.       It's actually really quite awful, and that's saying something. Forced third person, glitchier than hell, none of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ charm of Postal 2.",0
"I got this game for free from RWS, but i think they only did that because they wanted to violate me somehow.",0
"How to play Postal 3  step 1. Never buy it step 2. Never play it step 3. Never ♥♥♥♥ING play it EVER  My god. MY ♥♥♥♥ING GOODNESS GRACIOUS, what a waste of money, even on sale. not even worth $1.99. This game is absolutely horrendous! The sounds are rancid, the controls are broken, the glitches are nasty, the camera has tourette's, the story is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, the new postal dude style is so ♥♥♥♥ing ginger, the new voice is something to frown upon, the music is garbage and random, the cast is meh, the menus are bland as ♥♥♥♥, the weapon choice is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥, the frame rate is worse than the Xbox one; need i say more? Not only is this a failure of a Postal game, but this is one of the worst games i have honestly ever played in my entire life. I never in my entire life uninstalled a game 1 hour in. There is not single positive thing about this game at all. It does not deserve the title of Postal and now i can see why Urinating on the Postal 3 case in Postal 2 gets you an achievement. Even Running With Scissors acknowledges that it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ game, and that's why they continue to update Postal 2 and pretend Postal 3 is just some spin off.  Do not buy this piece of ♥♥♥♥ unless you either A. Want to play a game that is the equivalent to Foodfight! on Heroin. B. Want to play a game to torture yourself from start to finish. C. Want to buy it for someone else to make them contemplate suicide.  (that's actually how i got this game)  So please, don't ♥♥♥♥ing waste your time with this piece of ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ed from another piece of ♥♥♥♥.",0
Basically just avoid this page entirely and go buy Postal 2 instead. It's for your own good.,0
"Postal 2 won't go down in history as one of the greatest games of all time. It probably won't even make the average top 500 list. That said, I thought it was very entertaining. When it comes to Postal III, I'm at a loss for words. I'd prefer to write a positive review, describing in detail on how this game improved on its predecessor. If necessary, I could write a negative review, filled to the brim with reasons as to why I believe this product to be a disappointing sequel. Instead, I'm staring into the abyss.  The Postal Dude is at it again. After blazing a trail of death and destruction through the town of Paradise, he finds himself in Catharsis. Madcap mayhem and wacky hijinks await as Postal Dude tries to find a paying job. Will you somehow find the light of virtue within yourself? Or will you once again submit to your demons, using murder to solve every minor dilemna? Whatever the case, you're sure to be in for a great time. This game also stars Ron Jeremy and Jennifer Walcott. I'm surprised that Lloyd Kaufman didn't make an appearance as well.  This entry uses a morality system. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean The Postal Dude will be helping old ladies cross the street (or into woodchippers). Basically, if you want to be the good guy, you have to abide by the law. Naturally, this requires that you become a police officer, and make the law your own. While this doesn't give you a free pass to endanger innocent lives, at least you're doing your part to make Catharsis a safer(?) place. If that sounds like too much trouble, you can always be evil incarnate. This will result in different levels, and eventually a bad ending, if you don't change your ways. If eternal damnation doesn't appeal to you, there's always the handy taser gun. Non-lethal takedowns slowly add up, allowing you another opportunity to join the force when you complete the level. Unfortunately, the possibility exists that your morality, will be at the mercy of the game itself.  While I applaud the writers for their attempt at injecting more story into the Postal saga, things stop making sense very early on. I suppose this can be attributed to the fact that I had to skip stages in order to progress. Let me rephrase that: I had to cheat* just to complete this game. Aside from the high probability of crashes, there are numerous scripting issues. Some doors are scripted to open when an event occurs. For reasons that can surely be attributed to the troubled development of the game, these scripts frequently break.   To give an example: Shortly after I joined the force, I was tasked with eliminating the homeless that were running rampant through the police station. Eventually I reached a point where a door was supposed to open, but it didn't. I could see the enemy's guns clipping through the door, but there was nothing I could do about it. I restarted the level, which fixed it. However, there was another door later on in the level, and it had the exact same issue. This happened again in another level, where I was supposed to go to the mall, the doors simply wouldn't open.   Unlocking all of the stages in Postal III via cheats is a simple task, but that isn't the point. All that work I did trying to be a good Postal Dude? Gone. Putting difficulty aside, when a game can't be completed without resorting to cheats, that means it is broken.  Postal III tends to feel like busy-work. Most of the levels start off with an extremely boring job, which fits in with the story. After a short time, things get crazy when Soccer Moms or Savage Nerds or Eco-Terrorists or ???? show up. This is the point where you have to kill/subdue a certain number of them so that the level will end. Postal 2's strength wasn't in standard FPS mechanics. A lot of the entertainment came from using the sandbox aspects. It was a game designed around finding different solutions for everyday problems (sometimes without murder). With Postal III, almost the entirety of the product involves shooting, and it is very poorly-handled. The Postal Dude can take cover, but it's so ineffective you're sometimes better off standing out in the open. On the bright side, the enemy AI is so bad they're liable to ignore or even forget about you in the heat of combat. The levels that don't require the player to deal with x amount of enemies, tend to be really linear slogs. There are even escort missions, as if players wouldn't have enough reasons to hate this game.   Aside from severe technical faults such as long load times and poor performance, Postal III also suffers from awful mechanics. Melee is basically useless. Even the heavier weapons, like the fire ax, don't work all that well. One of the items you acquire is a laser pointer, for leading Champ (your dog) to enemies. It is complete trash. The same can be said about most of Postal III's weapons. There's no real incentive to play with them, because they either don't work, or just aren't satisfying. Typically, the average Postal III play-through is going to revolve entirely around shooting everything. It gets old very quickly. Urinating is no longer infinite either. The Postal Dude can't ♥♥♥♥ as much as he wants, now he has to wait for his bladder to refill. Yes, it's probably an unnecessary thing to complain about, but it's still a nonsensical change that adds nothing to the game. Everything about Postal III is worse than its prequel...Everything**.  Some of you reading this review might not care about Postal. You might even think 'It's a garbage franchise anyway. Who cares?' Well, it's just my opinion, but I liked the second game. It was crass, offensive, and sometimes the humor fell absolutely flat. Yet underneath all of the nastiness, there is still a game. Postal III is broken, and is more prone to cause headaches than provide any entertainment value. The multitude of bugs, scripting failures, and generally unfun game-design, make for a forgettable entry in this controversial series.  *While I did cheat to complete a couple stages, I didn't actually try to skip any.  **The soundtrack is pretty decent.

"I got this game for free, and I still suffer buyer's remorse.",0
It's a great torture device! The american agent told me everything after I forced him to play this.,0
"This is the Adam Sandler of Postal titles. You know how Adam Sandler has talent and doesn't use it? This game kind of works like that.  It had potential to be great, but it didn't bother. Blame the guys in Russia who had done most of the work and decided that it was okay to publish the Bubsy 3D of 2011.",0
"Terribad.  Nothing like Postal 2, the controls are clunky as ♥♥♥♥, and there are SO MANY LOADING SCREENS. Seriously, there is one stage where its just you in a room waiting to push a button, be prepared for many many one off scenes like this. There is no real explorable world to mess with, its just isolated scenes you do a single mission per scene.  The combat, holy ♥♥♥♥ing christ the combat, how do you mess something like that up ? Theres a scene where you fight these crazy soccer moms, but 'making them leave' is almost impossible as they seem to take 10 fully charged stun gun shots and NOTHING HAPPENS. The vagueness in the combat system and missions are laughable at best and after so long get annoying as hell. This is also the first game I have encountered where the crosshairs are completely useless, so that is another gem of a ♥♥♥♥ up to add to the ongoing list of fail this game has.  Just buy postal 2 and forget this game came out until RWS decides to make their own kick ♥♥♥ addition to the series instead of this outsourced joke of a 'game'.  *UPDATE* Another thing to note: I beat this game in 10 hours, and it only took 10 hours cause i am an achievement ♥♥♥♥ who will waste lots of free time on any achieve if its there. So this is maybe an 8 hour game at most.",0
"It’s not fair to say that the darkness consumed me, for it was I who enveloped myself in it, there was no coercion involved, only my own maddened curiosity. Another Postal game was released? Well, the second one was charming in that somewhat difficult to explain way that not very good games sometimes are, and it was on sale for a tenner, what could I possibly lose? Sometimes in the quiet hours of the night, when it seems not even God is there to hear me, I ask myself what I could have saved had I never clicked ‘Add to Cart’. It’s more than the ten dollars, what I lost that day transcends the mere balancing of a checkbook, when I played this game the concepts of love, of faith in my fellow man, the very knowledge of any pleasures I had once known all fled from me in an instant.   I wish I could chalk my dislike of this game up to the awful controls, the movement clunkier than a 50’s movie robot or the aiming that I can only describe as ‘acrid’, like the breath of a drunken pirate manning the cannons of his schooner, the fearsome ‘Nobody Will Ever Love You’. I can’t though, much like an iceberg made of solid human feces it goes much deeper than the surface problems. I didn’t even come across anything that offensive in my two-hour waterboarding session with Postal 3, I know that’s exactly what it’s meant to do, and it succeeds with a lot of people, but it just fell flat. The limp and lifeless writing, which is exactly what it permanently rendered certain parts of my body, is the most grotesque thing here aside from the animations and cutscenes. All of this combines to form some sort of chimera of awful design that leaves an unpleasant taste in your mouth that has nothing to do with the attempted gross out humor involving vacuum cleaners and AIDS infected cats.   In the end, it all just tries so hard to elicit some kind of response, positive or negative, from the player, but much like God on the day this game was released, it simply left me feeling apathetic.",0
This game is about as good as you could expect for a game that was coded in a weekend,0
"There are no words to describe how awful this one is. So I just want you to imagine a depressed 47 year old man with a massive drinking problem hanging himself by the sunroof inside of his trailer, only to have it break causing him to fall and then start crying until he dehydrates his whole body to death over a course of three days.",0
I wouldn't even poke this game with a stick.,0
Installed it to uninstall it.,0
"Postal 3, a third sequel to the cult classic, POSTAL franchise. This game, developed by Akella, NOT Running With Scissors - sees the Postal Dude rigth after a Nuclear Bomb goes off in the previous city, crosses a zombie infested bridge and is now forced to find a job in a new city, Catharsis, where a matter of chaotic events occur.  The game features a branching Storyline System ala Mass Effect's Paragon system, but more black and white with it's execution, it does make the game differ greatly with it's content and is a highly welcome addition imo - the rest of the game however... is terrible. It is a third person shooter that barely plays at all, it was built on Valve's Source Engine way back in the day, this game pretty much controls terribly and loosely, has music falling out of loops, AI bugging out occasionally and much more that just scream unfinished.  I should mention I do enjoy this game for what it is (a fan of the POSTAL franchise and the kind of macabre humor it uses) but from extremely buggy set pieces (Doors closing on you halting chapter progress.), horrible performance issues (Game is NOT enabled to properly run on Multi Core PCs and PhysX feature do a LOT more harm than good), spotty AI and just overall terrible loose mechanics, the game is most definately a skip to those whom are not willing to put up with the game;s shortcoming - those being dang near everything else - considering the game is buggy to the point of it being borderline unplayable.",0
"Postal 2 was great, but Postal III is just awful.",0
This game is so bad the devs needed to make DLC for the old game to make up for this catastrophe.,0
"Sack of ♥♥♥♥. It's one of those games where you constantly have to babysit NPC's who are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they can't even follow you to the objective (meaning you can't win.)  Waste of money, and I paid $5 for it.",0
"Broken, broken, broken. I'll admit that I had fun for a little while, I laughed a couple times, but in the end, the bugs get in the way of this one. Load times are irritatingly long, animations are broken, and it's just not something you'd expect after the better half of a decade of waiting.  If you catch it under $4.99, go for it; it's worth five dollars of fun. Otherwise, keep looking.",0
"If it weren't for the fact that this game is an unstable piece of ♥♥♥♥ that crashes if you so much as look at it funny, I might have recommended it anyways in spite of its design problems. The game itself is just the right kind of awful to mock and poke fun at, it's just a shame that getting it to work requires no less than sorcery and blood sacrifices.  Not even for free would I recommend this.",0
"If you're expecting anything in this game that is either on par with or improved upon from Postal 2, you will be severely disappointed. If you're expecting a competent shooter with good humor, you will be severely disappointed. If you're expecting anything more than complete garbage, you will be severely disappointed.  Seriously, this game just about broke my heart when I played it. At first, I couldn't accept the fact that what I was playing was terrible, because I pre-ordered it for the full $60 and I didn't WANT to believe that it was bad. Regardless, my senses eventually kicked in. This game is the reason why I have a category in my Steam Library labeled 'Horrible Mistakes'.",0
"  This is BAD.  I now understand why RWS were giving out copies of this at Phoenix Comiccon 2016, so they could have basically no stock of it.  If you really want a sequel to POSTAL 2, get Paradise Lost.",0
Play Postal 2 instead of this garbage,0
You're better off just buying Postal 2,0
"If you liked Postal 2 don't buy this game, it's terrible and nothing like Postal 2.",0
"Running With Scissors - the creators - were royally screwed by the Russian developers. THe Russian developers blew through their money and then pushed the game out to sell it without RWS permission. RWS has disowned this sequel.  That said, this game is a raging pile of ♥♥♥♥ and not worth your time even if it is free.",0
"Horrible, horrible game. I like Postal 1 and really enjoy Postal 2. The open endedness is what I especially enjoy and it's totally missing in Postal 3. I played for a short while, to the part where I'm supposed to pick up 'used' tissues. It was at this point I realized the entire game was going to be like this; they stick you in an area with a specific goal and can't do anything else. It's more like a bunch of mini-games. Totally dissappointed and regret spending money for this game.",0
"Just when I tought nothing could possibly be worse than the movie (Uwe Boll? Seriously? As if he didn´t slaughter enough franchises already...), along came part three.  Plain and simple: This is a very, very, very bad game. Oh boy, is it bad...  If you wonder how bad, just bear in mind that even the original devs (P3 was made by... I don´t know, some studio I never heard of) mocked and retconned it in the latest Postal 2 addon. That´s how bad it is.  Go play Postal 2 instead.",0
"the postal game that RWS technicaly dousen't own  I'm a RWS fan, and I respect Vince Desi, so it pains me to say - don't buy this game. if you have to find out what its like, find someone who has it and play their copy for 15 minuets. find a lets-play, do something, just don't buy this game. this is a train wreck and everyone knows it.   Unless something changed in the past two years RWS is not even making money off this because of the shady coding house they did business with to produce this. that company gutted the script, gutted the features and hurried the alpha out the door as a final game and screwed Running With Sissors out of the rights to the code.   this is an official game but one that RWS can't support and likely a game that they are not making a dime off of. wait for the next chapter of the game because I'm sure the postal dude will dismiss this one as the nightmare it is. Like mario's dream that was Super Mario Bros 2, Postal III might as well not exist in the catalog of this franchise.  I do no exagerate in saying that this game is completely broken, unbalenced and not fun. a total waste of $20  buyer be ware- This is a steaming pile!",0
"It has SO much missing potential, but unfortunately, it's a bit of a letdown. Doesn't stop me from modding it, though. It's pretty flexible in that department.",0
"This is the edgy annoying teenager of video games. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Even RWS (Running With Scissors, the developers of the previous two Postal games) have dissed this game. You know it's bad when developers diss an installment of their own franchise. It's not even entertaining in the really bad game sense, it's just pure try-hard garbage. Put your money towards Postal 2, or hell, any other game, but do not even get close to this game.",0
"After so many years, Postal 3 is released... BUT... by the aptly named Trashmasters. The game, while it has an awesome themesong you can hear in the trailer, has agonizing load times, insufferable missions, awkward controls, and forcing you to sit through all this for the sandbox option, make this worse than a disappointment.  Running With Scissors has completely disowned with 'installment' and with good reason. Stay far away from this. This is not a 'game,' it's a shattered dream.  Edit: Oh, also, RWS didn't even make the thing. It was made by the aply named Trashmasters.",0
"Poorly optimised, and doesn't live up to the glory of Postal 2.",0
I love the postal series don't get me wrong but I just think they did a horrible job on this one it just felt slow and the game got you scratching your head. I recommend you buy postal 1 and 2 not this one sorry.,0
"I'm a huge fan of the Postal series. I have been for a long time. The last game I came across in the series was Postal 3... not even developed by RWS. Confused, but enticed by the 'Postal' title, I purchased it. What I was met with was unspeakable... Broken movement, awful animations, atrocious voice acting, a lackluster story and gunplay so broken and not fun I just... ugh.. I forced myself to beat this game. Resulted in headaches (I'm serious) rage, (I'm serious) and almost coming to TEARS (I'M SERIOUS) DO. NO. BUY. IF YOU HAVE, GET A REFUND!  Edit: I did it on the good path, which is even worse than the bad path, BECAUSE IN SOME PARTS YOU CAN'T KILL ANYONE IN A ♥♥♥♥ING POSTAL GAME. A GAME ABOUT KILLING, WHY WOULD THERE BE A GOOD PATH?!",0
This game is not good,0
"Get Postal 2, stay away from this game. The devs act like this game didnt exist, thats why they made paridise lost to make up for this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.",0
"As a huge fan of committing attrocities in Postal 2, I'm sorry to say I had to give up on this weak ♥♥♥ game. Gone is the open world, free form fun. No, now we need to follow some half-baked linear story as if that was ever anyone's interest in this franchise. How is grabbing cats and decking soccer mums anything compared to filling a bank with grenades, pouring in gasoline and making it rain like a stripclub of flaming meat-paste. This is the diet coke of evil.",0
"No... just no. Poor performance, third person postal, no cool weapons and missions",0
"0/10  One of the clunkiest, ugliest, and most senseless sacks of garbage that I have ever come across. I am absolutely ashamed and embarrassed to own this piece of ♥♥♥♥! I would pay money for Steam to remove this off my history forever so that I never have to be reminded of its existence. ♥♥♥♥ you Postal III!",0
Akella won't even fix this game. Do yourself a favor and go buy Postal 2 rather than this turd,0
"Honestly, do the world a favor and buy postal 2, not this. However, if you like the idea of modding, postal 3 is quite easy to alter, that's literally the only upside. As quite frankly the missions are awkward as sin, awkward aiming with weaponry and incredibly clunky melee combat. But then again the clunky melee combat is a GIVEN, it's source engine afterall folks.  Honesty time: Only purchased this to mod it to recreate / attempt to remake postal 1 or 2 features in it.",0
"As a Postal fan, I was surprised to see this wasn't actually good. I got to the second mission, where you have to use cat nip spray to get a bunch of HIV cats, however, there was a few problems.  1: When a cat gets latched onto you, you have to spam left and right mouse to get it off. This wouldn't be a problem, but if you have the cat nip out, you can easily press right mouse, which consumes a ton of cat nip that's needed for the mission. Yes, it's limited. No, there are no refills (not as far as I could see)  2: The Chinese gang never stopped attacking me. And this is the second level, where my only weapons are cats, cat nip spray, and a vacuum. They had pistols, machetes, and M16s. Little unfair. Also, they never stopped respawning, leaving little time for me to grab the cats. I ended up having to throw a cat at one of the guys to grab a machete, which took some time. Which brings me to point 3.  3: Some weapons are broken. My favorite weapon from Postal 2, the machete, is reduced to a useless toy. The main attack took many attacks, and throwing it like a boomerang was hard. The machete wasn't thrown at the crosshair, rather below it, and even then it would miss a ton of targets. Also, it got stuck often, even when thrown in an open space.  After dying 3 times, the game crashed. I was dissapointed in this game. The gore is better than Postal 2 in my opinion, but there's so many glitches and the game is unfair on the earliest levels. Although, I'm probably one of the few who's okay with the new voice actor (mainly because Akella actually offered to have Rick Hunter voice the game, though he refused) and while some lines were pretty funny to me ('I blame pacman.') some lines pretty much made me cringe. ('Bacon bacon bacon!' and other fire related lines) I also think I heard him say a really old meme (the cheeseburger one) but since this game was made in 2011 I can excuse that.  If you do plan on getting this game, turn off motion blur at the start. It'll save you a lot of headaches.  ",0
I loved Postal 2 and heck I even enjoyed the Uwe Boll film. But this game kind of sucks to be honest. It has some enjoyable moments here and there but most of the time it just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. The AI can be very annoying most of the time. For example. the mission where you have to escort the slave to City Hall. Every time I shot a paparazzi he would run back and I would have to hit him just so he can follow me. There are also a crap ton of glitches. In the same mission the slave would always get stuck trying to pass through a doorway. I would have to shoot him and keep saving so I can restart. The voice acting was sub par at best. It feels like no one really wanted to be there. I might continue playing the game but that's only because I payed for this and because I loved the second one. I wouldn't be surprised if I just stopped playing because I have better games.,0
"Well, I was really looking forward to this when I saw it, hoping it was as silly as the first two games, but amazingly enough, it's got less story than Postal 2, and the camera shaking, oh lord, that was hard to cope with while playing it, and then it was made with the Source engine, which you can see pretty much straight away, I would stay away from this game unless you have a gut of steel and don't want to play it for the story. No freeroaming up to where I've gotten, which is very sad.",0
"Don't know what to say about POSTAL 3.The story is ok...A pretty good soundtrack but the gameplay sux and is very repetitive: Pros: -Good story -Has some funny moments -You get to play as a cop XDDD Cons: -Full of bugs -Few weapons -Melee weapons are horrible in this game -Very repetitive -Some achievements won't unlock -Poor AI; I would only recommend this game if you are a hardcore fan of the postal series.On the other hand this game wasn't taken seriously by the game devs. they just thrown some ♥♥♥♥ togheter and called it Postal 3.But in the end it's not that bad if you manage to spent some time in it,don't forget it was made with Source Engine and has his good parts.In my opinion I'll give a 5.5/10.",0
"I have been a fan of Running with Scissors and Postal, but Postal III was not published by Running with Scissors and had me bored after 75 minutes. It is time to go back and play the original Postal. Hopefully some day Running with Scissors will make a new Postal similar to the original with updated graphics.",0
"no where near as good as the second one. plus it has bugs... just fotget this one and go get the second one, its so much more fun.",0
"wow this is horriblly unplayable. I can totally understand the sub-par reviews; silly me I thought it would have been for the subject matter. Horrible controls, lousy graphics, bad gameplay and voice acting combinded with sub-standard in-you-face forced info cutscenes that add nothing. 13 gig download for THIS? Avoid at all costs unless you like to feel ripped off.",0
"I got this game for free, but I cant shake the feeling that I got ripped off somehow...",0
Reading through Postal 3's design documents was more fun than actually playing it.  Update: Updating this review just so I can get a Steam badge ._.,0
"'Rated W for what the ♥♥♥♥ were they thinking?'  The trailer said it best. This game is so horrible that even RWS hates it. Paradise lost-DLC for Postal 2 is the true sequel to Postal 2, not this piece of trash.",0
"I'm bored and I felt like writing some negative reveiws, so i've decided to re-write my Postal III review!  Pros: -RWS retconned the events of this game so really this game is not even part of the actual story line, it was only a terrible nightmare in the mind of The Postal Dude during his radiation coma in Paradise Lost! -It's a great joke   Cons: -It's all toilet humor -Has pointless celebrity cameos -Doesn't feel like a Postal game -It features Uwe Boll -The developers (Akkella) didn't optimize the game at all -It runs on a very broken version of the source engine (Akkella literally broke Source) -Akkella refused to release the source code -Akkella refused to update the game -Akkella refused to release an SDK KIT -RWS had to create a DRM hack to make the game actually launch on newer OS's -It's not worth 20 dollars   FINAL RATING: 0/10 (DO NOT ♥♥♥♥ING BUY THIS)   Here's a link to POSTAL 1 and 2 AND the newest Expansion Pack for Postal 2, go buy these instead.

"Listen to everything you hear about this game. It's awful. I think the biggest problem is they tried to make the game far more linear than past Postals, and yet still fill it with fetch quests. I was just bored. Constantly. The humor is awful, too. Not even in a 'ah that was a bad pun' kind of way, but in a 'kid in the back of the class who thinks he's hilarious by spouting awful jokes and catch-phrases' kind of way. Big disappointment.",0
"i bought this ONLY for the story and the fact that i love the postal series and want more of it, the game is complete garbage. and the rws is self aware that this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. if you love good games, don't buy this crap. ",0
Classical deadly madness meet silly stupid trash. Sometimes it is even ridiculous. 5/10,0
"All in all, the game just feels... disingenuous. It was difficult enough to recommend this game. I was previously under the impression that had this game not been so poorly optimized (multiple crashes, poor hit detection, abysmal framerate during combat), this game would have been perceived as just... okay. However, I had to give my two cents.  Pros: *The Soundtrack - surprisingly good. Clearly much more effort went into it than everything else.  Aaaand that's about it.  Netural Points: *Third person perspective - I personally don't mind it, but it would've been nice to have had the option of having a first person perspective, too. *Corey Cruise as Postal Dude - disappointing to not have Rick Hunter's amazing voice soothing my ears, but Cruise still does a commendable job.  Cons:  Hoo boy. Here we go.  *The Humor - The game made me laugh out loud a few times, but it needed more originality. Rehashing lines and jokes from Postal 2 doesn't make it funny. It feels forced. Also, guys, making The Postal Dude say 'I blame (irrelevant subject here)!' nearly every time he kills something isn't. funny. The only one that made me laugh was 'I blame Christian Metal.'  *No map, arrows, or anything that indicated where to go next. *The annoyingly long loading times. *Poor optimization. *crashes frequently. *stutters every time a new mission starts. *A.I. can be incredibly stupid, especially when you're supposed to protect someone. *The sound is imbalanced. The last mission was nothing but LOUD gunfire. Nearly put me in a trance. Did give me a headache, though. *No Open-world exploration in between missions - Seriously??? This is what made Postal 2 so much fun!  *The Story is told in past tense - Kind of hard to explain, but The Postal Dude narrates the entire game and explains what happens next in the story. This is fine, but sometimes it's better to PLAY and not TELL what happens next. Can I please PLAY the scenario out and not have to be bombarded with cutscenes that break the momentum and flow?  *Good/Evil karma system, Multiple Endings - interesting idea. good for replayability. Too bad I achieved one of the endings in about 5 hours, most of which were spent wondering where the heck I was supposed to go next. Besides, there's no way I'd want to replay this again. Too much of a chore.  Did I enjoy myself during this game? A little. Did I laugh? Yes. Are Postal 2, and Postal 2: Paradise Lost superior to this game in every conceivable way? Oh yes. Heck yes.",0
"The game could have been a below average shooter with an interesting setting if the game worked as it should. But the game does not work as it should. The performance is horrible, hit detection for melee weapon sucks and the game crashes all the time.",0
"This game is just a crap...   Nothing works the way it should and killing stuff just feels boring, even shooting sperm paper feels boring.  It is not nearly as open as the second game and feels more like a corridor shooter (even if it isn't).   I recommend picking up the second installment in the series instead.    2/10",0
"Game always crashes at a certain point of the story for me during the initial release, now even today the game hasnt been fixed. Im not gonna bother looking for fixes for an abomination of this game is, i wish steam refund released when i bought this game.",0
"I am uncertain if it is a joke or not, but I found it to be a terrible game. It tries to play up as many jokes as it can about the history of the Postal franchise and how vulgar it can be, but part of the endearing peice of Postal 2 was that is was an open world. This is more like a hallway where you just get to do something disturbing, instead of causing a city block to devolve into a blood bath. Postal 2 was a great game, let us forget that this was even made.",0
"One Word... HORRIBLE.  The fact that this game wears the name Postal is a disgrace. Everything you loved about the Postal franchise gets ♥♥♥♥♥ by bad Russian developers who took in fact many years to create this broken crap product. It was also released way too early. Thanks to a Russian publisher which went for the money. I hope Akella is dead. RWS got pretty much ignored when this product was created. Also Akella and the devs left the product to die. Not even a proper source code has been released. This makes it nearly impossible to fix or mod the game. There are a few decent mods though. The game is so bad that many game functionalities are simply not working like melee weapon hit detection. To this comes bad performance and crashes. Story and gameplay wisely this product is a joke anyway. But I personally dont waste my time with this product and you shouldnt neither. Buy Paradise Lost instead. Or wait for Postal 3 Unreal. A Postal 3 remake in the unreal engine. Remade from scratch! Also there is Catharsis Reborn. Some sort of remake/sequel/alternative game in the Postal 3 Source engine. They might be able to create something good with it. Also we might be getting a proper patch once, but I doubt it. The game would still be bad for a Postal game, even if its fixed and bugfree.  I waited so long for it, but it was just crap in the end. Sad story...  My Rating? None, I simply dont want to rate a broken alpha product. Not worth it. If you really need to try this game, get it somewhere 'free' or get a very very cheap key. Sometimes RWS also gives some out for free, as demonstration how bad the game is. Im honest, I didnt finish the game. I guess some years ago I made it to the half with tons of crashes. Recently I got the Steam version for a cheap price. Its nearly as bad as it was when it was released. I simply cant bring myself to play this ♥♥♥♥ to end. Seriously. This game rapes me, I demand injury compensation!  Positive: - Partly nice art design - I partly like the 'evil' twin Postal Dude's design and new voice, cool that it was reused in Paradise Lost  Negative: - Bugs and crashes - Perfornance problems - Sound mixing problems, too loud, too quiet, missing sounds, unfitting sounds - Melee weapons have a hit detection thats probably the worst ever - Unifitting unpostalish humor - No free roam - Boring repetitive missions - Trash, bad sort of trash - Bad English grammar and text - Russian quality in general... + Akella sucks  It may could have been a good game if they let RWS help with the developement. But instead there was silence between both devs and Akella just made it worse with fast releasing it. This was the death for the game. RWS regrets this game a lot and I doubt that there will ever be something like this happening again.",0
"So ♥♥♥♥ing disappointed in this game. Don't get me wrong, I loved the first two Postal games but this one is hands down one of the worst games I've ever played. It's Sonic '06 level bad people. Basically the game throws you into 3-4 minute load screens and that's not even the worst of it. Sure, you can run around and kill whoever and whatever you want, but the missions are all, and I mean every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ one, is a kill this many people or keep this many protesters at bay. There's nothing else to this game.  Still want to play? Enjoy the worst voice acting I have ever seen and somehow, the graphics look worse than Postal II. The gameplay and weapons are all grotesque, and not in a good way. The 'sick humor' is about as sick as my dying veteran, grandpa, bland and just lies there laughing to himself like a four year old that finds the word 'booger' to be the funniest thing ever. Can't believe I wasted my money on this and I wish I could get a refund and afford to see a therapist about this game.",0
  people make mistakes. This one is easy to avoid though.,0
This is quite possibly the worst game ever made. Not even ironically enjoyable in any capacity.   A blight on humanity.,0
WATCH OUT HE'S GOING POSTAL 3 EXCEPT THIS TIME IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING TRASH ♥♥♥♥ YOU,0
I am not going to make a review about the story or the sense of the game. Postal 2 was a well made game with a nice way to play.  But Postal 3 is such a bad compiled bunch of time wasting. The controls are horrobly. The loading times are also terrible. All cutscenes (even uif you skip them) are annoying.  I was realy looking for a good time in Postal 3 and haveing some fun listening to all the critical comments and events.  I am sorry to say but Postal 3 sucks. (Just to keep the slang of Postal),0
Don't Buy This.,0
"I love humor and some ideas in this game (soundtrack is quite good too) but, well, too many things are f*cked up. Stupid AI (espessially in escort missions), a lot of bugs, crashes, outdated graphics, cover system which doesn't help in any way, collision system, tiny city, police which doesn't really give a f*ck (if you kill something about 20 people a few policemen will start to chase you and if you kill them... that's all), good path (really?) which is boring as s**t, aiming... Do I really need to mention more? It's quite pity... Oh, it doesn't even work on Windows 8.1 by the way.  EDIT: Well, I found a way to launch this s**t on Windows 8.1 but still, all other things I mentioned aren't fixed (and most probably won't be).",0
everything that made postal 2 fun has been stripped and retextured.. what a shame,0
"what a major let down, I regret my purchase. Waste of $20.00",0
"Payed $40 for this on release. I wanna buy it for a m8 as a joke, but the thought of spending a total of $50 altogether leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",0
"alright let me start off by saying postal 2 is one of the best games that has ever been made on steam BUT and this is a big but this game is as worthless as it is slow it crashes every ten minutes the controls are insanely clunky and broken, the glitches are game breaking for example my sprint button dosn't work at all, the cutscenes take hours and appear every five seconds it is now in third person which completely ruins the atmosphere my finale words on this game is better luck next time running with scissors I think it's time to go back to your roots.",0
"The Postal Dude awakens with a shock, it was all just a horrible nightmare. or was it?",0
13 hours pain 13 hours screaming and beating my keyboard 13 hours of nightmare + I think i got ebola and cancer from this.,0
Press shiny red button to crash.,0
"when i was first buying the game i was sad to see such poor reviews for the game but like the consumer i am i bought the thing on sale.I was so excited but then it happened,line after line of reused jokes from postal 2.Mind you they did have some good original ones but it didnt make up for the unappealing gameplay.So to get a good grip of whats good and bad.Here's some pros and cons. Lets start with some good news Pros  Funny story(And thats pretty much it)  Cons  Buggy gameplay  Rehashed jokes from the originals   No open-world   Third-person change  crappy new cover system   The saddest part is,its not rws's fault here its when they hired other companies to help and they burned all their money away and shoved this pile of filth out. So if you plan on buying it dont because it will sit in your library gaining dust.   ",0
Don't buy this game is broken.,0
"Postal 3 is definitely a unique game. It isn't good. It tries too hard to be funny, and fails completely while in the process. I really had no fun playing this game and it doesn't even have giggle value while playing with friends. It isnt worth much imo but was a unique experience and a good topic for any bad video game analysis speech or paper.",0
How do you release a crappy game? It's easy Just be the one with the name 'Akella',0
"Don't get me wrong, Postal III is hilarious and I have a good time playing but the glitches just make it unbearable. At best I could get an hour of playtime before the game crashes. If it were not for the bugs and glitches then Postal III would have been a hilarious masterpiece. If anything its all these annoying bugs that hold it back from being such a good game.",0

I really wanted to play this game but it is so poorly optimized I can barely play it ;( If there is any patches let me know.,0
They tried.,0
"ok so this game is based on current world issues and stuff and just makes fun of stereotypes and can be offensive and has been really contraversial for ever, like since 1997, and if you arnt a baby its incredibly fun. this is not as good as the first 2 seeing as it was made by a different studieo but its still a good time. not great but ok.its fun if your super bored but Postal 2 is way better.this is like a spin off, even rws says so.  {RWS Explanation}v Postal III didn’t turn out how RWS had hoped. The original plan was for RWS to do game design and style art, with Akella responsible for production (coding, game art, audio, playtesting, etc.). The project started out great with both groups working close together, then the first blow came with the Russian economy taking a hit and Akella lost their A development team and the project got moved to Team B. Looking back now we should have canceled the project then as there was no way the new less qualified team was going to be able to deliver a “A” quality game. The next big blow was when Akella started chopping away at our design (to accommodate the limited skills of the 2nd string team), this only got worse over time. From eliminating gameplay to single player only to PC only and scratching consoles. The hole kept getting deeper and the ♥♥♥♥ shovel was in full force. We didn't even get to see or play the game in the last 12 months of development, then the worst thing happened. Akella was desperate for money trying to prevent going out of business. They made the fatal decision to ‘wrap it up’ at alpha and call it done, releasing it to the Russian market, then on Steam for the international market.  Akella retains control of all the source code and assets for Postal III which they will not share with us or the modding community, so we are unable to fix Postal III ourselves, leaving a flawed and unfinished game. RWS also do not profit from Postal III sales and we stopped selling it ourselves the moment it was clear we would be unable to support the product.  Postal III is not without some redeeming features for fans of POSTAL: graphically it looks nice, the cutscene art and music was decent and it has some interesting unique weapons such as the Badger Saw. The branching storyline and Good versus Bad system allows you to replay the game and encounter new levels, alternative scenes and it even allows you to complete the objectives differently. The game at least knows it’s a train wreck and will often make fun of itself during the objective screens.",0
"I played postal 2 many many many times through. The open world gameplay and funny easter eggish type gameplay was a lot of fun. You could follow the story or just run around causing chaos with awesome effects and humorous outcomes.  So I was super excited and suprised when I saw postal 3 on steam. Boy was I majorly disappointed. I saw it had the potentional for that same off society norm humor but the game itself is terrible. NO OPEN WORLD. The first few 'areas' I tried were timed, small and so poorly executed it was frustrating. Not to mention where the crosshairs are and where you can actually hit anything was beyond frustrating. I tried for at least an hour or so to have any fun but finally gave up and uninstalled. So sad too compared to the genius of the first 2 games.",0
"Terrible game... Game Is base off an old source engine build so all the levels caches need to rebuild apon loading, The AI is terrible and annoying, Weapon selection is terrible sometimes during heavy combat, why put in a shotgun then have no ammo for it for the entire ♥♥♥♥ing game? , The game crashed at least four times when loading a few levels.. It's not worth it.. another classic game gone to nothing but ♥♥♥♥! &gt;=C",0
"It's ♥♥♥♥. It's long-winded, it's thirdperson, there are next-to-no terrorists and it doesn't have Free-Roam by default.  In short, don't waste your money, buy Postal 2 again.",0
POSTAL 3 is just crappy not fun .... i liked the Postal 2 the best,0
It sucks.  2/10,0
"I don't think this would be a recommendation, it's more like an avoidation. If you want a good Postal game, get the old ones. Since this one right here was a big disappointment. In short I recommend that you shouldn't get this.",0
"I sure enjoyed Postal 2... Now there's a Postal 3 on the Source Engine! The trailers and gameplay look cool, nothing too serious just messing around. Is this game worth buying? No. Not at all. Back when this was first released the publishers of this game released it early by mistake (a month!) later on the game was re-released a few months later. It was a complete disaster. The steam version is in Russian, and there is no legit or 'legal' way should I say to get this game into English. The game is very buggy, very poor performance and frame rate issues, clunky controls, the game is just bad. Don't buy it. Ever.",0
"This is the buggiest piece of crap I have ever played. Steam REFUSES to give me a refund, even though I bought this game back in April of 2012 for $40. The only reason I have more than 2 hours playtime is because it was stuck in the loader downloading the game on a 384kb line back in 2012 (I live in South Africa) and steam decided that me downloading the game was actually me playing it. I hardly played this game, it completly bugged out on the segway mission, with AI driving into walls and getting stuck. Worst purchase I have ever made, I urge anyone else considering to buy this NOT TO. Don't pay a single cent for this garbage.",0
"This game is awfully developed, disappointing to play, 'a bad joke'-to pay for and i can advise it to nobody. It's really like a 'Beta-Version' and is not worth 01,00$! Everything is glitching and you'll find a bug every minute. I love(d) 'Postal II' so much, it was one of the best games I've ever played. Postal III is not just nearly unplayable. It has nothing to do with Postal II - game mechanics. No more 'free-world' action-adventure 'I have to buy milk and will not pay for it' - freedom.  Do not buy it. It's on sale? Do not buy it! Someone gifted it to you. Do not play it!",0
"As a diehard fan of the real Postal games, it's very difficult for me to think of any redeeming qualities of Postal III.  Many know this already, but for those who don't, Postal III is not the creation of Running With Scissors. It was licensed to Akella in hopes of developing a next generation Postal game, but thanks to the Russian recession Akella went bankrupt and all developmental work went to a fledgling 'b-team.' The results were catastrophic, as what was once intended to be an open ended and graphically impressive Postal became a bug-ridden mess.   Although its price can never be justified even at 50% off, I will say that for those who already own it, two things about this game are decent. First is the free-roam feature that is unlocked after completing those horrid story missions. If you really can't stand playing through it, which few can, there are ways to bypass the missions that a simple Google search will yield. The free-roam itself is mediocre, as there are few things to do but walk around and slaughter a few civilians until the game crashes, but it's much more rewarding than the series of tutorials that constitute the main game.  The second feature worth mentioning was a joke that occurred... I'd say about halfway through the game, where the Alternative Postal Dude is approaching a building being held up by rather incompetent shooters. In the midst of the inaccurate bullet fest, a peacekeeper attempts to approach the building only to have his head blown off. The Postal Dude then exclaims, 'holy s***, did they level up?' It made me laugh, anyways.  That's really all that's worth experiencing in Postal III. You're much better off paying a fraction of Postal III's price to own the real Postal games.",0

whose ♥♥♥♥ing idea was this,0
"Possibly the ♥♥♥♥♥est game of all time.   aiming is ♥♥♥♥♥, very linear and repetative and no option to explore.  if its a choice between this and having your balls bitten off by a rabid mouse then I strongly suggest finding that mouse",0
"I played this game for half an hour, and that was it.I counldn't take any more terrible gameplay. Dont waste your time, Postal 2 was way better",0
"Oh God, this game sucks. The combat sucks, the physics suck, the missions suck, the voice acting sucks, the weapons suck, the graphics suck, and so forth.  Also, it runs like crap.  [Rating: 35/100]",0
"Game crashed 3 times.. says a lot with how long I've played, don't bother buying it!",0
"Don't buy this game. Never. Take Postal2, it's better.",0
Easily one of the worst games ever created.,0
"I really wanted to love this game I really did. They changed it from the FPS style that Postal had into a third person view which really took away from the appeal that Postal 2 had. The game itself is also very buggy, the devs promised updates to this. The raunchy humor is a bit tuned down in this installment. I gave it 5/10 which is mostly the nostalgia talking. RWS should have just made a updated Postal 2 and they would have made a great game.",0
I would advise anyone not to purchase this game. Apparently there is no way to activate. So unfortunately I can't give a review of the game itself. Just a PSA to anyone thinking of purchasing.,0
As much as I wanted to love this game I just cant bring myself to. I played postal 2 nonstop when I discovered it years ago and was stoaked when I found out about the third game. I would recommend sticking to postal 2.,0
"Probably the black sheep of the postal series, this peice of crap dosen't even deserve the title of being a game, it is a peice of crap baddly made horrible and pure filth and stain on the postal series, first off, rick hunters is not the voice actor of postal dude anymore they got some wannabe who sounds like Duke nukem, postal dude is not postal dude without his Briliant old voice actor, second off, the game is in third person, WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥, postal 2 was in first person and it was amazing even if the third persion animations were not amazing the action in first person made up to it, it gave a better expirence in my opinion, third, Not open world, the story sucks ♥♥♥♥ the charaters are stupid, and the game promotes you todo good things?! WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?! you are ment to go bad ♥♥♥♥ insain in postal and kill what you want and do what you want, if you are not able to enjoy that without the game saying 'Oh if you do good you will have a good ending' thats just stupid, Postal is about sinister dark humor and you having your way with the game,the voice acting is stupid the weapons suck and it runs on the most overused engine, no not unreal thats an awesome engine, im talking about source yes the ♥♥♥♥ing source engine, the primitive engine that valve uses but they use it great, these stupid ukranian developers made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with it so thats pure garbage, there name is trashmasters, pff no wonder they are masters at making trash ♥♥♥♥♥♥ baddly made games, please running with scissors cut contact with those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs expand your team get rick hunters back and give the postal fans what they want, postal 2 made my late childhood amazing and to see the postal series downfall is not somthing i want.   -Dukie A hardcore postal fan",0
"No, just no, the game is full of bugs and the AI is so silly. Enjoy the first time that you complete the carreer, because after that the game turns so repetitive and isn't fun anymore. All what they had to do was improve the graphics of Postal II, add a few new features, weapons, stuff, and this game would be a gem. Just doesn't worth the $20",0
"Dont buy this game unless it is £2 / $3.50 its just not worth any more than that. I am a fan of the Postal series so i was happy to buy it, i knew it would be bad from reviews but wanted to play the story through for storyline reasons.  Dont buy it unless you have played Postal 2 as it could put you off the series  This on the other hand is a complete knock up of a game, its buggy and its incomplete.  Theres no way the game can be fixed because akella wont release the source code to RWS . Why !?  couldnt they just make more money if the game was better? i dont know the polotics and im not bothered...them &amp; running with scissors issues not mine   So basically a badly broken game, bugs glitches, no crashes for me but others have said they had them.  It does have some humour but not like postal 2 .   But all in all a let down , and a prime example in gaming of 'what could have been'",0
"Take everything that made Postal 2 good, now get rid of it and replace it with a extremely buggy, unfunny game.   Just play Postal 2 again if you are a Postal fan, I was massively disappointed by this and loved the first 2 games.",0
"this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ not fun, hard to relate to! not as fun as 2  verry annoying start.",0
This game is ♥♥♥♥ compared to Postal 2.,0
"Wow, this is one big-blast waste of money. Seriously. I played Postal 2, and I was a huge fan of it. But this one? Crappy made, reused sounds from it's predecessor, laggy controling and gameplay, broken game mechanics. I don't even comprehend how the developers could be anything near happy with that game, after what they've accomplished in the past. Keep your money away from ♥♥♥♥ of game design, guys.",0
"The branching paths gimmick gives it enough replaybility to go through it at least twice, the shooting is fun and the story is consistently funny. On the other side, it's a mess of bugs and glitches and costs too much for what plays like something made 5 years ago. Buy it when it's u$20 or less.",0
"Do not buy. Not if you like Postal. Not if it's on sale. Never ever. I though 'Oh well it's Postal so of course it's trashy, but who cares?'. It's crap. I wish I could say a nice thing, but it's that bad.",0
"Not worth buying.. the second game was kinda hilarious, running around and doing ♥♥♥♥ all over the place, but this game doesn't even come close to it. Gameplay is constantly interrupted by stupid video sequences, the third person perspective is a step back as aiming and shooting with weapons is very inaccurate, there is a lot of bugs and the game crashes every few times. Where is the original corny voice of the postal dude? The new voice is not nearly as good. I can only say: don't bother with this game, unless maybe for a discount price.",0

"If like me, you're one of the sick individuals that loved Postal 2 and for some reason tuned out all the negative press about THIS game as the usual reactionary nonsense... RUN! This is broken, souless and dissappointing. It's not fun, it's not funny, it's not as open or even really as violent. The stupidity is no longer tongue in cheek, it's just stupid, like, the unholy offspring of Sarah Palin and Boris Johnson stupid. Go play Postal 2 instead, it has new DLC... for some reason.",0
My biggest mistake. This game haunts my library with its presence Kill me,0
"This is made by a company called 'Trash Masters.' Their animated logo features the a letter T and M actually engaging in intercourse. If that sounds funny to you, it only goes downhill from there.",0
"In a word NO! Don't go for it. I loved Postal 2 with its open ended world (with progressive plot if you knew where to look) and wicked sense of humour. I thought I was getting a good deal when I got a $10 steam key from the publisher for Postal 3, but it couldn't even live up to that. Each mission takes place on a small map. The movement is awkward. It isn't even worth saying more.",0
"One of the most unoptimized PC games ever made. It crashes, it freezes, and it stutters, constantly. Even with user-created .cgf files, Postal III is guaranteed to be a frustrating technical challenge for even the most stacked high-end computer.  The developers went belly up shortly after the game was released, and it's not hard to understand why after playing just a few minutes of this atrocious excuse for code. Even worse, the publisher has disavowed Postal III completely, and they refuse to fix it or improve it in any way, shape, or form.  Not only is Postal III a buggy piece of crap, it fares no better gameplay-wise. Despite being an open-world game, the story forces you down a particular path, and you aren't allowed to free roam until you've completed all the missions. The weapons suck, the graphics suck, the environments suck, the sound effects suck. Absolutely everything about Postal III sucks. You're better off going with Postal 2 -- it's cheaper and it actually runs properly.  Screw the developers and the publisher of this digital abortion. They should have known better.",0
Not as great as I was hoping for. This one was licensed out and made by a Russian third party developer and not by RWS in-house. It has it's moments but it's lacking in some areas. It's also very buggy at times.,0
"Being a big fan of Postal 2, I got this one as soon as it was released, but it was so terribly unfinished, that I was forced to delete it after 20 minutes. By now Running With Scissors forums officially call P3 'rip-off made by Akella' and unfortunately that's all you need to know.   Stay away!!!",0

"I'm not going to claim that 'Postal 2' was a masterpiece of the art form. It wasn't. It was trashy, poorly coded, and its humour was more groan worthy than anything. But goddamit, it WAS fun in some sick, twisted way - particularly when aided by the 'A Week in Paradise' mod that expanded its variety and fixed a lot of its bugs, etc. It was a cathartic experience that let you indulge in a bit of depravity to let the stress flow by. 'Postal III' on the other hand, is a torture simulator at the players expense - not the NPCs. This game is abysmally bad. The hit detection is the worst I've ever experienced in a game, and even when you do hit there's no sense of tactile feedback. There is not a single weapon in this game, except perhaps the Badger, that is in any way satisfying to use. About the only praise I can give this game in ANY sense is that while the humour is still pretty rank, there are a few more genuinely good, surreal jokes that might hit low brow sensibilities. I actually did laugh once or twice when the joke wasn't 'Misogyny/gross stuff' etc. This is the most broken ♥♥♥ game I've ever seen released that took so long to make, this was in development as far back as 2004 and yet it feels like a proof of concept alpha - a proof of concept that in any true quality assurance workers mind, would not see as proving any viable concept at all. Its linear, broken, and practically unplayable. Say what you will about Postal 2 and its flaws - but at least everyone can agree that this one is legitimately pure ♥♥♥♥.",0
"If you loved everything about POSTAL 2 you are going to ♥♥♥♥ing hate this game; I gurantee it. Tho it is in itself a unique adventure, it is a disgrace to the second, Dude sounds like he is trying way to hard to sound like POSTAL Dude. The gameplay is mediocore and the switching between weapons gets very difficult when they decide to bind a whole ♥♥♥♥ load of random keys to weapons. The story ends before it even really begins and ther eisnt the free roam and exploring as there was in POSTAL 2. I will admit some of the speech in the game is rather humorus, you are better off just watching the cut scenes on youtube.",0
"There is simply NOTHING good about this game. Think of everything that was fun about Postal 2 and none of that is in Postal 3. This is a really god awful 3rd person shooter with terrible gun combat mechanics, a broken melee system with horrible hit detection, and remember the open world non linear structure of Postal 2? Well now it's 100% linear. It wasn't until months after its release that they put in an open world mode which is just a save file with the whole city and no missions. That was the only midly decent thing in the whole game. Another thing that sucks is that they don't even have the Postal Dude's voice actor from the last game.  Do you want to know what the worst part of this game is? A good 80-85% of the game are escort/protection missions. Apparantly in Russia game devs think that gamers LOVE escort missions with the worst AI so they should make that the focus of the game. Because when you think Postal, you totally think of escort missions. Maybe that's what was missing from Postal 1&amp;2. The game's long series of escort missions involve never ending spaws of enemies who all have one goal which is to kill your target and shoot at you. The guy you protect has no logic, they just stand there getting shot until they die. In missions where you need to follow someone to a goal, they often just stop or get stuck on something while the endless enemies kill them. When it comes to protecting someone in a single location, it's more of the same, they stand in once place and get shot to death.  The story is passable, but you can watch all the cut scenes on YouTube and save yourself $20. One thing that was promised was branching story paths with real drastic changes to the plot, like what jobs you have, such as being a cop or a terrorist, or even running for president. The reality is that the game has a karma meter and the more innocents that die in your crossfire, the more the meter turns evil which puts you on the evil path. One of the first 'evil' missions has you on a cult where you use their version of the Gravity Gun from Half-Life to suck up apples and shoot them in barrels, 100 apples. They actually thought this would be fun. In the end, it's the same old crap, and I never did find a way to gain moral points. You just lose morality from accidently killing people with the terrible controls.  That's the whole game. There's a ton of escort missions, really bad shoot 'em up levels that have terrible level design (often getting you lost,) tons and tons of glitches, a variety of weapons, but none of them are that useful, the worst AI possible, weak voice acting, a lame story, and the creators of Postal had nothing to do with the making of this game, they infact disowned this game and pulled it from their web store. I remember a lot of critics hating Postal 2 and giving it crazy low scores without even playing it, but this game actually deserves to be bashed. There's just nothing fun about it. Not even mods could ever fix this mess of a game.",0
"This game is the biggest turd... it is so bug ridden that it is embarrasing. All the stupid things should add up to something fun in a dumb way, but because everything functions so poorly it ends up being frustrating. Also I have no idea who at RWS said that this game, essentially Postal 2 with updated graphics, should be third person. Whoever suggested it should be forced to play this game for hours on end, and believe me when I say that is quite the sadistic torture.",0
"This is made by a company called 'Trash Masters.' Their animated logo features the a letter T and M actually engaging in intercourse. If that sounds funny to you, it only goes downhill from there.",0
"In a word NO! Don't go for it. I loved Postal 2 with its open ended world (with progressive plot if you knew where to look) and wicked sense of humour. I thought I was getting a good deal when I got a $10 steam key from the publisher for Postal 3, but it couldn't even live up to that. Each mission takes place on a small map. The movement is awkward. It isn't even worth saying more.",0
"One of the most unoptimized PC games ever made. It crashes, it freezes, and it stutters, constantly. Even with user-created .cgf files, Postal III is guaranteed to be a frustrating technical challenge for even the most stacked high-end computer.  The developers went belly up shortly after the game was released, and it's not hard to understand why after playing just a few minutes of this atrocious excuse for code. Even worse, the publisher has disavowed Postal III completely, and they refuse to fix it or improve it in any way, shape, or form.  Not only is Postal III a buggy piece of crap, it fares no better gameplay-wise. Despite being an open-world game, the story forces you down a particular path, and you aren't allowed to free roam until you've completed all the missions. The weapons suck, the graphics suck, the environments suck, the sound effects suck. Absolutely everything about Postal III sucks. You're better off going with Postal 2 -- it's cheaper and it actually runs properly.  Screw the developers and the publisher of this digital abortion. They should have known better.",0
Not as great as I was hoping for. This one was licensed out and made by a Russian third party developer and not by RWS in-house. It has it's moments but it's lacking in some areas. It's also very buggy at times.,0
"Being a big fan of Postal 2, I got this one as soon as it was released, but it was so terribly unfinished, that I was forced to delete it after 20 minutes. By now Running With Scissors forums officially call P3 'rip-off made by Akella' and unfortunately that's all you need to know.   Stay away!!!",0
"Avoid. The gameplay mechanics and game theme are all messed up in this 'upgraded' version. Running With Scissors tried something different by partnering with a different company and ended messing up. The game is broken and feels like a demo. Go Postal 2, it is superior in every aspect beside graphics.",0
"Avoid this game. Here's why it is delayed: Valve wants a complete game on Steam. Duke Nukem Forever may have been dated and buggy, but when compared to Postal 3, DNF suddenly turns into Skyrim quality entertainment.",0
"This game is horrible.. running with scissors even tries to deny having anything to do with it, which I do not blame them. Full of bugs, repetitive gameplay and nothing like the previous in the series.",0
"'What an excellent and profitable game POSTAL 2 is, I wonder how we can profit from it more.' 'Hey vince, I got an idea. Let's get some unexperienced ruskies to develop a terribly buggy and raunchy third sequel that everyone will blame us for and want our severed heads on stakes in their front garden.' 'That sounds like an EXCELLENT idea, let us get to it right now then we can make some real dosh'    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeXatquVqAc ",0
"This game is like The room of video games, not to inculde that alot of people where waiting for Postal 3 and they gave us this but lets just say this, its so bad that its oddly good, in the way that this entire game is a joke that needs to be laughed at and mocked so we never repeat this, and because of it we get the true 'Postal 3', Paradise lost, so just remember that some bad things can lead to the good things,  Thank you RWS for making great games, and sorry you had a big bump in the road of success.",0
The Most Crap Postal Game i ever played just buy 1 and 2 to make up for this bugged up abomination that holds the postal name,0
"From my original review, Postal III was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful sequel to Postal 2.  However, let's take it back a few notches.  Postal III is a third person shooter, unlike Postal 2, which was a first person shooter. The game, gameplay wise, is similar to Postal 2. You shoot ♥♥♥♥ and perform tasks. However, Postal III introduces alignment. You can be good, or bad, and depending on your actions, you get different endings. For example, helping cops bust a hippie pot ring aligns you Good. Killing everyone during the bust aligns you Bad. That is a pretty cool feature that makes this game one of the more unique Postal games.  The game makes outside references to the likes of people such as the infamous director Uwe Boll, Gary Coleman from Postal 2, and other such things. It's got the Postal feel, and everything that is there is great, but it doesn't work all the time.  That's really my only main complaint with the game. Due to layoffs and rushes, the game is extremely buggy, and crashes often. The game runs on Valve's Source Engine.  Postal III on the inside has all the mechanics and gameplay aspects to make a good Postal game. However, on the outside, it's a buggy mess that crashes often, has gameplay breaking bugs such as cutscenes not playing, parts of the map unrendering, and other such things.   It's price isn't really warranted, considering it is a buggy crashing mess. If you get it gifted, or buy it out of curiosity, you might be dissapointed, but the game itself is still enjoyable if you can look passed it's flaws.",0
Like Postal 2? Well keep playing it. This game blows ♥♥♥. Simple as that.,0
"this is a really bad sequel to postal 2. you should think that with the source engine it would be a great experience, but no.  you cant feel that your are playing with the same engine as the half-life 2 series. i would consider my self a fan of postal 2 and the movie, so the only thing making this game worth bying is the humor, thats just as insane as the rest of the postal branch, but not surprised that this game got such a lawsy metascore.",0
The game was amusing at times and on it's own I guess was playable once but it just did not live up to my expectations obtained from many play throughs of postal II. I suppose if you are a fan the series and it's going cheap it might be worth it but don't expect to much.,0
Jesus they butchered this game so much.. Im only 1 hour in and im wondering wtf this ♥♥♥♥ is. It feels like a half-life 2 mod with different models. Not postal at all. Do yourself a favor and go buy Postal 2 and play that instead.,0
"  This game is horrible.    And when I say horrible, I mean literally the worst game I have ever played, in my entire life. Node graph errors occur every time you play this game, and you will always expect some sort of graphical issue when playing this title. Akella has ruined the macabre concept of the Postal Dude, getting a new voice actor, and removing jumping and replacing it with a faulty cover system.  Hell, the only way to have fun in this game is heavily mod it. The only realistic model in this game is of Postal Dude, with every single civilian appearing to be a cartoon character from a Disney film. Commanding Champ to take out enemies just straight up doesn't work, you are better off using the helper monkey which appears literally once in the game. The third person view is not that bad, but then you realize Akella probably did that to make the Postal series more like a GTA clone.   The whole good/bad paths in the game do not mean anything. In a game where you can amputate a mans arm, throw it at another person, all while urinating on them, the game punishes you severely for doing anything close to bad. And if you select the good path, the game is no fun, whatsoever. Nobody confronts you (except Osama Bin Laden) and because the game is on rails, being wanted by the police means nothing. There isn't even a system that allows you to know you are wanted, you just do soemthing, and every single officer unloads on you. To make that worse, you can't evade them until you die.  The high note in this game is the weapons. I mean, a badger on a stick that you can have maul people to death, it's crazy. Krotchy doll nukes, the shop-vac, all were great ideas, but had a very poor execution.  The demo shown in 2007 had better graphics, gameplay, and overall feel than this game. At best, this is something a college student would make in Unity3D. 3.5/10  ",0
"Postal III was a disgrace. Not with the story , ideas, or concept, BUT WITH overused / stupidass jokes, A different Voice Actor for Postal Dude, bugs, and most of all the melee weapons. It took you 10 punches and kicks to kill a man with bare fists. ",0
"Akella's POSTAL Spin off (AKA Postal III) is a game I would no longer recommend to anyone. It's full of bugs and glitches, most of the weapons are rubbish, the AI is horrendous, the frame rate will randomly shoot down at times, no free roam for you until you finish the story and despite the fact that this game was released in 2012 in the UK and Europe, it's using the same version of the Source engine that was used in Half-Life 2: Episode 2. Akella and TrashMasters have completely abandoned the game, so why should you buy this unfinished mess?   Most of the staff at Running With Scissors don't even like this game. If you want to play a good Postal game, buy Postal 2.",0
Don't buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game. Even if it's for free don't get it. It's like putting bleach in your eyes. Even the original developers of Postal I and II condemn it. It's so ♥♥♥♥ing bad. Just don't make the mistake I made and buying this thing.,0
"Not at all like Postal 2. Made on the Source engine and being a third-person shooter, wrechs the game even more.  Like Postal 2 don't play Postal III.",0
footing awfull................. bigest pile of sheite i have ever seen....... its worse than a cows afterbirth,0
the 1st ♥♥♥♥ing level is laggy as ♥♥♥♥ and the enimes repawn soon as you kill them the controls belong in a mgs game and %20 the humor belongs in duke nuke em' not postal and do not use impuse 101 unless you want ur game to crash,0
This game is complete ♥♥♥♥.,0
This might just be the worst game I ever payed for.,0
"Unfortunately for RWS, this game was really badly developed and completely unoptimized. It's not their fault as they handed the development off to a russian company that started having financial troubles and had to lay off their prime team because they couldn't afford to pay them anymore. Instead, they fell back to the backup team which couldn't handle most of the intended design, and the game had to be extensively redesigned to accomodate their lack of experience and skill. I believe the company has completely shut down now, and won't give RWS the source code so they could properly clean it up and perfect it. Instead, RWS has chosen to abandon this horrible game, and resume working on Postal 2. Buy that instead, don't waste your money on this game! (they're working on a new DLC for Postal 2 right now!)",0
Not Bad But not good either i played this for a bit then got bored of there crappy AI they get stuck behind walls none stop!  Also enemys can stand in front of a door so you can get through then there hands come through the door so you can still kill them but there bodys block the door so it is impossible and half the time it dosent even work!!!! over all good killing but bad AI. if you are looking for a disapointment get this game.,0
"* Well to sum it up, the problem of this game is that is just plain boring, it fails to recapture the ridicolous morbid fun of its predecessor.  * The graphics are good, it runs on Source Engine and looks alright to me, although there some mighty performance glitches with frame rate dropping. * The open world is there partially, but you cannot complete missions as you like but have to stick to the main story line.  * You revisit the outdoor locations several times during the game, which gets repetitive and the task you get are one stereotype. * You collect something, then all of sudden there is a riot by some of the minorities or some other group of extremists, which you have to eliminate. * You cannot get inside any building, you can take a look indoors only during missions, which is a nice change of pace, then you go back outside to one of the three main locations: downtown of city, mexican border or some kind of farm. * I loved Postal 2 for not being the perfect game, but for trying not to be convetional and yet entertaining, but this one just couldn't hold up its potential.",0
Postal 2 is a much better game. Go buy that instead the devs are still working on it. This is just bad.,0
not as fun as the second game,0
"Utter wank.Do not buy this travesty,stick to Postal 2.",0
"Worst game I have ever played, nothing like Postal 2.",0
NO UNCLE TIMOTHY I DON'T WANT TO TAKE MY PANTS OFF!,0
Go buy the Postal 2 series. Loved Postal 2. Played it for many an hour.   Don't waste your money on this. Regret buying it. I waited for damn near 10 years for this turd?,0
"Don't bother with this game. It's so riddled with bugs it's not worth playing. When the Russian developer took over the duties from Running With Scissors they had no clue what a Postal game is supposed to be. Postal's about sick humor but giving you a mission that involves picking up used kleenex from a porno peep show is not just sick, it's just gross.   The controls are confusing, the graphics stuck in 2005 and the story disgusting. In short if the game is free and you're a 12 year old that likes to eat your own boogers this game is great...  ",0
"I wouldnt have this game if Vince Desi didn't send it to me for free, lol. Thanks Vince glad you have had a little success with postal 2. Can't wait for something new from you guys ! Postal III=poop",0
"What can I say that would do Postal Triple justice? Huge let down? Sucks ♥♥♥? Complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t?  No, none of these do justice to what a failure this game was. Hyped, hyped and hyped, but ultimately it is trying to mimic Duke Nukem Forever, which we all know is not a good thing. It tried to build off of contraversary and it failed miserably. The game is more or less just a constant 'look at me! Satire!' mess endorsed by Ron Jeremy.  Take my advice, don't buy this game. It's a buggy mess, the story is laughable and not in the funny way the developers want you to think, and on top of that, it's just not fun.  Generally that's what counts: the game isn't fun. Physics make for unfun combat, wonky AI makes for unfun enemies, unfunny story makes for unfun experience.",0
DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!! Made my computer crash dunno if it was cuz i was using non lethal force but my comp ended up not working for 5 minutes and then it took ages for the bios screen to even appear. Don't know what happened just glad i got a working computer its an i7 with 16gigs of ram I can't believe steam would sell this if there's a risk of it wrecking your computer. It should be taken off the store.,0
This game sucks.,0
"Not even fun to play as a joke. Why would you take a great open world game with great jokes, and fun gameplay, then turn it into this piece garbage. dont buy it. If you think its like postal 2 but with better graphics, then youre wrong. Its poorly optimized, not open world, and glitchy as hell. Now i see why rws made an expantion to postal 2 4 years after this game came out. ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME.",0
Waste of money. I don't recommend this game. It was pretty disappointing,0
"Horrible. Camera angle makes it just plain anoying. While the setup and the comments and the storey were likely meant to be dark humor it just ends up being gross - which is an echevement on it's own.  Bad story, bad looks, bad controlls, bad camera, feels like one of low-budget games from 2000. Stay clear.",0
at least without those negative comments and reviews we wouldnt have postal 2 on steam now,0
"Postal III. Where do i start. Well first of all this game is nothing compared to Postal, and Postal II. What this game can offer is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ source engine. With ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay overall. If this game would have been first person with the old Postal II engine or something new (ANYTHING ELSE THAN ♥♥♥♥ING SOURCE ENGINE) i would have gladly finished through the game. But thanks Akella for ruining the game",0
"Wow. Talk about one of the worst products ever made, in just about every way possible. Unlike the previous postal, the game/level design is painfully linear with little to no room to explore. The third-person POV also feels really awkward, and using weapons and such feels really clunky. Loading times are atrociously long and the game itself is full of bugs that will probably never be fixed.  What's worse than all those things is that Postal 3 was really poorly optimized. It doesn't matter whether your gaming rig is decent or top-notch, you'll get random lagspikes and frame drops. Oh and the game crashes entirely too often, and for no apparent reason. Certainly not the game I was expecting, considering this game took several years of waiting to come out...ugh. The humor also feels really offensive, in Postal 2 the humor felt at least somewhat funny, but in Postal 3 it feels like they were being offensive for the sake of being offensive.  In short, Postal 3 felt like a huge waste of money and time I've spent playing it. RWS themselves deny having anything to do with Postal 3, and the gamers themselves refer to it as 'the russian postal' instead of a sequel. After playing it, I can hardly blame them. 0.5/5.0",0
"When it takes over 5 minutes just to load up the game and get to some gameplay, you know something is a miss. When the gameplay later on is so terrible and badly programmed so that you need a handful of luck to even get passed the tutorial, you know you have a real turdsandwish in your hands.  Do not buy this game. It's nothing like the series earlier installmeants.",0
"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!   Even now that it's finally on sale for a very low price of 4.99 I still have to say that you should not spend money on this. The game is extremely buggy, the combat barely works, the crosshair doesn't actually show where you're aiming with most weapons, grenades fall through the floor, the game stutters during gun fights on a way more than capable machine. Don't buy this game, get Postal 2 paradise lost instead. I'm getting a refund for this right now.",0
Tons of bugs make Postal III totally unplayable.,0
Tons of bugs make Postal III totally unplayable.,0
I wish this game would stop crashing on me.,0
"I expect something better than 3rd person, and if they go back to this game and remade it.my review might change",0
when i open up the game it loads the menu i click new game then went to the loading screen after a little bit of loading the screen goes black so i got out of the game a box popped up saying failed to lock vertex buffer so i can't even play a few seconds so i would appreciate it if you could fix it,0
wow what happend to postal? Postal 2 was amazing and funny but what is this?  also it crashes all 20min it is not enjoyable!!!!,0
"I loved postal 2, and this is not postal 2. Long story short a different company landed the rights to make the game, tanked, and absolutely blew it.  It's level based, boring, and there is no open world game mechanic.  1/10, you f*cked with a classic, that really sucks.",0
"After I bought Postal 2, i saw that there was a third one and it had modern-day graphics and i thought that was pretty cool and then I saw all the negative reviews except for the literally only postive review and i thought to myself, hmmm I wonder how bad this game is? Seeing as how the second one was badass and amazingly better than some of the AAA games we get served today, so i bought it, played it and beat it, and now i now why this game is slandered, even RWS has given up on this trainwreck but before i trash this game more i have to say there are parts of this game that are good but far from being awesome.  Like my review of Postal 2, this review will broken down in the same areas  Gameplay, Graphics, Sound and most importantly Story  Warning: this is my opinon and if anything offends you, i deeply apolgize  Gameplay 5/10: the overall gmeplay isn't all to bad, the controls aren't bad but they are a big difference from its predecessor, the main control feature i like about this game is you don't have to use the mouse scroll for changing your guns, you can now use X and C for that which for me (being a console gamer for 16 years) is a big up for me since i'm still new to the PC controls. The game praises it's so called 'advanced AI' but in reality the so-called 'advanced AI' isn't so advanced unless advanced AI means running in your line of fire and killing all the 'advanced AI' in like two seconds  Graphics 6/10: the graphics of this game are not that bad but also not that good for a game that was realeased in 2011. there are times where the graphics acutally look complete and then other times your face palming with more regert than Patrick Stewert.  Sound 8/10: this is the only department that this game did good in. The BGM of this game is amazing, the only time the BGM is bad, is that it is stuck in a never-ending loop, so in the longer levels in the game it starts to become a ear ache. The sound F/X of this game is why the sound gets an 8 out of 10 instead of being a perfect score, the gun noises in this aren't as realistic as they were Postal 2, but they aren't horrible either, at least they are actually sounds instead of one guy making 'pew-pew' noises.  Story 6/10: the only reason this game's story did better than Postal 2 is because it's more of a linear based game, so there is more room for story, but the main reason ot only did a point better was becasue it's story was all over the f***ing place, when i finally beat the game, i had no f***ing idea what the f*** happend, the story has more holes in it than swiss cheese or a Micheal Bay movie (uggh don't get me started on him)  Overall 4.5/10: Overall this game needs A LOT more work and if it was developed on for a little bit longer (i'd say like two more years) it may have been a better game but I personally think that it should have been the exact same game as the second but with a new story and graphics like Halo 3. (ahhh if only) But before i go, the nic people over at Anthology Production, are making a mod for Postal 2, and it's basically taking Postal 3 and putting it into the engine of the second game and more! So i cannot wait for it to come out. so as you can see I do NOT reccomend this game but if you really want to play this s***ty game than wait for that mod.",0
"The game is buggy, broken &amp; sometimes unplayable.   I get to around chapter 3 &amp; can't progress any further because of constant crashes or glitches. The game hasn't seen any fixes either. I honestly can't recommend this game unless one day the devs decide it's worth fixing. Even then the humor is tasteless &amp; might have been funny or offensive in the early/late 90's. Now, it's just childish &amp; sad really.  If they ironed out the bugs it would be a decent 3rd person toilet humor shooter but with all the bugs, glitches, crashes &amp; other problems the game has it's just a chore to try and play through it.  I got this game when it came out, too. What a waste of money.",0
"I expect something better than 3rd person, and if they go back to this game and remade it.my review might change",0
This game could have been fun. Too bad it sucks major ♥♥♥ !!!,0
"Postal III is a janky, barely functional mess that has none of the charm, character, or fun of Postal 2. Running With Scissors had little to do with this game and it shows. The game runs like ♥♥♥♥ (if you can get it running at all), and the first person, open world nature of the second game is replaced with boring, medicore, third-person cover based shooting. Oh yeah, don't forget everyone's favorite: A shallow binary moral choice system! Going around on rampages is still somewhat fun, but there is no heart or soul in this game. If you are an abosule, diehard Postal fan, pick it up on sale as cheap as you can if you're into some casual masochism. Otherwise avoid like the plague.  Also, ♥♥♥♥ the Postal Dude's new voice.",0

Postal III SUCKS bad. Need I say more?   1. Horrible controls 2. Lags bad even on low settings  3. Buggy and Glitches 4. Bad sound and missing sound effects  5. All around BAD! Avoid this one if you value your time and money.,0
"-Awfull Grapics -Awfull Gameplay -Game Crashed 14 times in 2 hours -Looks like Postal 2 -3rd person suddenly ? -Idiotic AI -Grapical Glitches -Fun weapons -Over the top crazy stuff  All in all the game sucks big time for the fact that it has more bugs then is funny, I can live with the poor grapics and the idiotic AI, What is not acceptable is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3rd Person view wich makes aiming a hell, The fact that the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and attacking them seems like your attack some sort of weird dummy, Overal very disappointing A giant downer to all the fans   Running with Scissors you should be ashamed to have produced this, I have seen freeware games made by amateurs wich easily are better then this.  -a hint to all DO NOT BUY THIS GAME- (sorry RWS but I cant recommend this it feels like a crappy game from 2006)",0
"Don't. Just...don't.  I liked Postal 2, because it was...different.  Sure, it was different mostly in awful ways, but the gameplay was tolerable, and the story &amp; content was unique (because they really didn't give a f♥ck about 'acceptable behavior' like those wussies that made Grand Theft Auto III), so it was a guilty pleasure, if not necessarily an 'overly' pleasurable one.  Postal III, though? Ugh.  In a franchise that (let's be honest) is constantly *trying* to offend you, it probably will as much as Postal 2 did, and this one still has that 'don't give a f♥ck' attitude.  But the gameplay, graphics, animation, all the video game-specific elements were sh♥t.  It's become South Park ca. 2013. No, really. In many ways. The  worst  ways.  - It's created this pedigree of offensive humor, doing things and saying things that no one's heard, and things you wouldn't repeat in front of Mom &amp; Dad. - It continues to be 'taboo', even though it's novelty is years dead. - The intense focus on continuing to offend (while running out of taboos) has gotten to the point that they succeed in being contraversial, but have  COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN HOW TO BE FUNNY ANYMORE . - The franchise should've died out somewhere around 2008, leaving fond memories for fans, not disappointment to *former* fans.  ...see?  All those are just like modern South Park. (sigh)  In one particular scene a...'mustachioed' Q-list celebrity has to make a speedy exit, and since the camera shows the scene's actors from the knees up, they just push the f♥cker across the screen, without bothering to animate his legs, and make Mel Blanc-type running sound.  I haven't bought as many games as some, but have bought more than most, so this statement may mean less, but it's nonetheless true:  This is the first video game I've ever bought that I truly regret getting.",0
"Horribly disgusting game. Postal and Postal II were great, but this was just a heaping pile of trash with the name added in as a money grab.",0
$20 for this? really?,0
"I can see that you're thinking of buying this. You're thinking 'Aha! Postal 2 was great, I want to try this too!' NAY I TELL YOU! Sure, there are a few hours of fun in here, but it's absolutely nowhere near as good as Postal 2 was. On top of that it's buggy and it feels like it was released while it was still in Beta development. I uninstalled it in frustration and disappointment.",0
"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It's absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing awful. I liked Postal 2, even though a lot of people turned their noses up at it, but this is unadulterated dogshit. Don't even buy it in a Steam sale. Only ever play it if someone agrees to remunerate you. HANDSOMELY.",0
"This is one of the buggiest games I've ever played: constant crashing, game breaking bugs, the works. Long story short, it was developed by a different developer than the one that made the first two Postal games, and it was released in alpha and seemingly abandoned. Do not buy.",0
"This game is an absolute wreck. It runs very unstable, there are a lot of glitches that lead me to believe that this game was published in its alpha stage as complete. The story itself is very bland and the humor... you can't really call that humor at all, it's just really bad and tries way too hard to be funny, comming across like a 10 year old wrote the jokes.  I can't recommend this game at all and apparently the owners of the franchise rights can't recommend it either.",0
"Half good gameplay with a sprinkle of humour drowned in bugs and repetitive sauce Do yourself a favor and get postal 2, better game on all points",0
I cant even open the game without it crashing within 30 seconds. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME... I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,0
"A truly awful and linear game. It is just the exact same thing over and over. Postal 2 was stupid, pointless, and fun. Postal 3 is stupid and pointless.",0
"There's a reason that after about a year; this game is half price. It sucks. In fact, it sucks so bad Running With Scissors doesn't even consider it a Postal game and calls it a 'spin-off'. Akella did nothing but suck this game up with a horrible story-line, clunky controls, and bugs out the wazoo. Avoid this game. You don't want it. You'll get fustrated after an hour and give up. I personally waited and waited for this and when I got it; was highly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off I'd wasted $40 on this garbage. Don't waste $20; don't waste $10, seriously, this game is not even worthy of the $.99 bin.",0
"I keep trying to play this game, just to see if it's me or not. Unusual and awkward controls and quite frankly rubbish graphics makes this much anticipated game a very large disappointment.",0
"Complete waste of $10. Bugs bugs bugs, and it won't launch in Windows 8.1.",0
"It's what you would expect from a Postal game as far as the humor and violence goes. Can't say I like the 3rd person perspective; it would be fine if it wasn't so clunky. The game is buggy and running on the source engine it should be a lot smoother. The game is no longer open world, but it tries to give some good/bad choices to make but they don't seem to make a huge difference. The game makes fun of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is, with stuff popping up on the screen like 'Postal Babes are on your side, so good luck not killing them in this AI cluster♥♥♥♥! HAHAHAHAH.' Wait for a $10 sale or at least until some mods come out and bugs are fixed.",0

"-Awfull Grapics -Awfull Gameplay -Game Crashed 14 times in 2 hours -Looks like Postal 2 -3rd person suddenly ? -Idiotic AI -Grapical Glitches -Fun weapons -Over the top crazy stuff  All in all the game sucks big time for the fact that it has more bugs then is funny, I can live with the poor grapics and the idiotic AI, What is not acceptable is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3rd Person view wich makes aiming a hell, The fact that the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and attacking them seems like your attack some sort of weird dummy, Overal very disappointing A giant downer to all the fans   Running with Scissors you should be ashamed to have produced this, I have seen freeware games made by amateurs wich easily are better then this.  -a hint to all DO NOT BUY THIS GAME- (sorry RWS but I cant recommend this it feels like a crappy game from 2006)",0
"Complete waste of time and money, The game was ♥♥♥♥. Didn't even have an open world like Postal 2. The FPS was horrible, Seems the game wasn't optimized at all. The AI was about the worst I have ever seen, No challenge at all. The story sucked, and just everything else about it was completely dissapointing. Unless you get paid to play it, Don't waste your time.",0

really disappointing,0
"I'm a fan of the series. After 2 hours of googling I finally got it running, only to wish it would have stayed broken. Do yourself a favor. Stay away.",0
its not as bad as everybody puts its a big disapointment as far as being a postal game you feel guided through the game it doesnt feel as open worldly and as exploring as it did in the 2nd one if you ask me this one had better and more fun blood affects but do does the second one and the second one is more fun. and if your new to postal just do yourslef a favora and buy the second one and never play the ♥♥♥♥ing campain,0
"Bad things about this game: 3rd person lock,♥♥♥♥ story,♥♥♥♥ controls,♥♥♥♥ gameplay = ♥♥♥♥ experience  Good things about this game: works as a good torture device!  and you know it's going to be bad when it's not made by running with scissors.",0
"The worst game I have ever played. Ever. Out of tons of other crappy games in the 30+ years I have played video games. Even Pong was done with more care than this POS was. There are so many things wrong with it, I could go on forever.  Play Postal 2 instead.",0
"This game sucks, it needs more freedom.....",0
"I played this long ago on Windows when it first came out but I had inferior hardware, I'm running a GTX660ti now but I don't think I'll try it after seeing all the bad reviews. I'll probably buy Postal 2 instead lol, I think that one has Linux support.",0
"WOW….just wow. I don’t know where to even start or even start, I mean look at the reviews, the comments, the ratings, THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME IT SELF!!!  Even the creators hated this game!!! (trust me the easter eggs in postal 2 dlc show how much!)  if you want RWS's best master piece creations there is...buy postal 2+paradise lost dlc.  other than that...no do not buy this game.",0
The second game is great but this..this one is just annoying! Do not waste your money on this! Just..horrible,0
This game is a horrible waste of money. If your interested in what postal is suppose to be like go over and pick up postal 2 its quite a bit older but compare to this piece of ♥♥♥♥ its godlike. Save your money.,0
"oh Postal III, why did i buy you? you're are not worth of my money, and the game i'snt that great. want to play Postal? play POSTAL 2 and the original, this so called 'Sequel' is'nt worth of you're money",0
I only wish refunds were available when this released.,0
"I have played postal 1 and postal 2 with the 1337 patch a long long time ago (to make it work properly on really old systems) and i have postal 2 on steam now, so essentially i have paid to that game twice now, actually 3 times as i bought it off rws website quite a few years ago as a digital download (non steam related). To be honest i dont mind as its a great game to play and still makes me laugh (good on ya running with scissors). However, i am a PC owner and a FPS player and i am a very dissapointed that this latest incarnation has turned into a TPS and appears to be a port from a console game. Not a happy bunny RWS, i should have taken on board what some of the others had said.",0
Wasted my 5e on sale i do instant refund i thinked i will enjoy this game but i be wrong,0
"Wow were to begin... well im Far over the system rec...8 core 4,01 GHZ . 16 gb system ram. gefore 680 gtx 2gb.. still first 2-3 missions around 60fps. after that its a lag fest around 14-22 fps and 15 crashes before i got past the uwe boll thingy... no spoilers...  Havent finished it but game is kinda postal fun but way to crahsy for me.  still whats not to hate/love about postal?.. hate the game and all its mechanics... but the story is ok.. dont expect postal 2 gameplay.. and hey its a story so dont expect a postal game.  Still like the fact theat they braught a story in. but still all game mechanics suck. but cant really stop trying doe.  God game just not wurth any cash its not finished and probably never will be.",0

WTF! Couldn't even get past pouring gasoline on zombies without it crashing.. twice!  The rest of the game seems kind of cheap too...,0
"If you hate the weird over-the-shoulder, off-to-the-side POV, you are going to hate this game. No good mods seem to exist for first person, or center-on-player view either. (Let me know if one does)",0
This game is like that creepy uncle that everyone denies being apart of the family  Get the Postal II. There's better offensive stereoypes.,0
If you grew up and loved the series like me then skip this mother♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. Even though i got this on sale its still a waste of money.,0
"Wont activate. Sux. Don't buy this crap. Spams you with 'Activation denied by server' even when you literally just bought it. Have emailed support, no answer yet but this shouldnt happen anyway. Not hard to manager your license server up time.  lol GG",0

"I found Postal 2 one of my guilty pleasures but this game, whilst having its good moments, is a letdown. It feels unfinished and is buggy. The missions are repetitive. You dont expect much from a Postal game and although I finished the game, it was a chore to do so.",0
WTF! Couldn't even get past pouring gasoline on zombies without it crashing.. twice!  The rest of the game seems kind of cheap too...,0
"The game isnt as good as the second, sure it is (little) fun but it is sad that it is so buggy.... It doesnt work on my Pc ( maybe will on yours) It wont continue. Keep in mind this s my review, you might like it.... :) buy the 2 if you want fun.",0
Most of the protect things missions are hard to me but i dont know about everyone else.,0
"This was massively dissapoinying, and i even knew what i was getting in to when i first staretd. *sigh*  i supose i ought to explain so:   graphics are fine there is nothing i have problem with vidually (mayble blood effects but that ill adress later.) physics : passable nothing to complain about story : huh? like that ever mattered  and now on to important stuff atmosphere sucks, there is something about catarsis that just dose not work for me, something that was there in Paradise i can not quite explain it but it feels like lesser coppy of previous attempt in postal 2. combat mechanics are quite strange, i have had problems landing mele attacks, whener i managed to do so it never felt like it was something i did that made the attack land it seemed to me as tho it was chance. in here i would like to adress blood effect which managed to fail at being overexadurated squirts as in P2 but allso fell short of being reasonible representation of what i assume blood squirts would look like in real life as result of that one of main draws of previous two games is just not fun annymore. look if you are doing game with main focus on gross humor and carnage you must make them fun damit!  charakters of player and nonplayer origin are allso falling short of mark, honestly this feels like fan made mod than proper game.  sorry RWS this one is a failure ",0
"Holy ♥♥♥♥ this is bad.  I mean I heard it was bad. And the last two games were bad games in their own ways as well. [NOTE: I am not talking about offensive content I am really talking about the quality of the games]. Postal 1 was an absolute mess, and a violent, attention whoring relic of early PC gaming, and Postal 2 was a short, glitchy, grotesque, and insanly racist piece of FPS history...  But this is more glitchy than it's predecessor, it lacks the 'charm' the previous game had, and it's not a sandbox! It's a poorly made 3rd person coverbased shooter that goes from bad cutscenes to bad gameplay back to bad cutscenes. THERE IS A FORCED TUTORIAL MISSION AT THE BEGINING CALLED 'CROSS THE BRIDGE' OR SOME ♥♥♥♥ AND YOU MOSTLY CROSS THE BRIDGE IN ♥♥♥♥ING CUTSCENES!!!  Bottom line the Postal series is a game set in a shared universe that is full of crude, immature shock comedy... and that isn't a bad thing. Frankly, I'm nostalgiaic over the first one. I played it a lot as a kid and at the time I took the whole thing as a big joke meant to offend people (which a great portion of it reall is just that), and my cousin played it, I shared it with all my friends back when I had the physical copy... It's the worlds wierdest 'kids' game lol. BUT Postal 3 has horrible UI, hit detection, level design, has the worst graphics of a Source powered game that I've ever scene... Get Postal 2: Paradise Lost and the Workshop MODs. ♥♥♥♥ Postal III!",0
"buggy, very laggy. i meet the reccommended requirements and it runs awful. cutscenes have choppy sound, and petrol is super hard to use. guns suck, except fro the m16, best gun imho.  i admit that my run issues probably stem from having to run this in wine, that said, ive run much more intesive games in wine on this system.",0
"Broken, thats the only word I can describe Postal 3, Poorly optimised and the terrible game design that is present through out both playthroughs of the game. Get Postal 2 instead, its not worth the money (Final score 2/10)",0
"Man I had so much fun with 'Postal 2' but this............was dissapointing! I mean people who play this on Youtube manage to have some fun with it but this is awful, it could be a fun game if you make fun of it with friends but other than that it sucks! Too much stupid and unwanted missions, no actual free roam where you can just mess around, crappy controls, and of course the cringe worthy dialogue. I got this game because I loved the sequel so much but this is just dissappointing! My review for this game..........It sucks! Wish I didn't waste my money on this stupid game! ",0
"My best friend gave me this for Christmas a long time ago and only now did I have a PC that can play it.  Lucky for him, we're not friends anymore, otherwise I'd have slapped him like you would slap a disobediant wife.",0
"This game is ♥♥♥♥, don't play.",0
"I am running a good system but I have had nothing but trouble playing this game.(you dont need a super computer to run it)  1.Lagging very bad that the game is unplayable. 2.Unexpected game stops??? 3.Freezing in certain places and it does not recover. 4.The achievement made are not all on the steam account??? 5.Graphics just freeking out and changing to mad colours. 6.Sound sometimes goes into a loop.sticky 7.Transfer and loading is laggy and sticks but it recovers (but not always)  One problem is OK but seven..not on.  I do not recommend this game,I have played the other Postal games with no problems but this one is very bad. You would actually think it would be much better.I was hoping it would be better.  Not happy waisted money on it.lucky it was a reduced price.  Stop Running With Scissors and walk.",0
The movie was waaaaay better than this ♥♥♥♥,0
0/10 -no humour -controls -story -annoying main character -pathetic missions,0
This game is a waste of Money. I cannot even Start The game up OR GET TO THE START SCREEN! Just Stay away. And if you know how to fix this. Message me!,0
"Bobbing, straight running, unreadable small text, Grafix did not improve, animations SUX...  I wasted years waiting for this junk.  Go and run with a scissors, RWS!",0
Personly it sucks.,0
I had a bit of fun with Postal 2 back in the day so when Portal 3 promised me a honey badger as a weapon and a better camera for the game I threw my money at this once it was on sale. As I purchased and installed this game I found the free roaming atmosphere that left the world open in the previous game where choice was key to story progression had been replaced with a small linear map that pushed obnoxious cutscenes in our face with a voiceover that screams 'I'm trying to sound like Duke Nukem.' The worst part is that this game actually gave me herpes. As I played this game I found that my fingers started breaking out in blemishes which then spread to my arms. Before anything could spread further the honey badger jumped out of the screen and ripped out my jugular. With my last breath I write this review. Please tell my family I'm sorry I bought this game.,0
"I thought I would enjoy this even with the negative reviews. It's bad like broken everything, bad animation, really bad models, crap voice acting. Just all around bad. Don't play it , But if ya really wanna try it wait for a sale maybe worth 2 bucks",0
This is the Duke Nukem Forever of the postal world only I could bring myself to play all the way through Duke Nukem and only played this game about 10 mins before walking off so I could complain about how bad the game is to a friend before coming back and uninstalling. Buy Postal 2 all day long as for 3 not even worth a quick play through.,0
"This game won't launch for me, though from what I can tell from other reviews and videos: postal 3 is an unfunny, boring, very linear, broken, poorly programmed, mess.   It also doesn't have rick hunter as the postal dude which is a massive let down because rick is the postal dude, he just is the postal dude, the new person sounds nothing like him and it feels wrong for him to say lines from the first two games, though the new ones sound fairly good though it really ruins the character since the postal dude is like no other character in any video game.",0
"Postal 3 starts with Uwe Boll giving you the finger, in a loading screen. This follows through the missions where it's apparent that the game it's just trying to mess with the player but not in the good old fashioned Postal way. Postal 3 strives so far from both of it's predecesors that eventually it seems clear that Trashmasters (ironically) don't know even the involment that a player has when it comes to it's game, it expects you to sit throughout boring, unstilized missions, without any purpose or reason behind them.  Postal 3 it's the pinnacle of bad game design, and insultity for the pleyer and the series, i'ts the lame, pathetic excuse that comes from a group of people that believe comedy begins with a fart and ends with and insult, with people that make pathetic. lame jokes, thinking that what causes controversy and makes someone feel offended somehow it's an attractive point in entertainment. Shame.",0
"i only beat the game because i am a fan of postal. the game is buggy as hell. at a few points i couldnt beat the mission because it was so buggy. sound quality is awful. the game is held back, there is not enough player choice outside of joining good or bad. i wanted to say no and kill both sides and be my own dude, but the game just said no to me and threw me to the 'bad' side.",0

"The game is broken, if you email  'arkhipov@akella.com'  then we're likely to get the achievements fixed.   First impressions so far.  I downloaded the game. (wish I hadn't). Clicked Play. I saw a picture of Uve Boll sticking his finger up at me, The game then crashed. Yep, that's basically my expectations for the rest of the game. I then started the tutuorial and was told to ingite some zombies. INGITE. (That's not my spelling mistake, that's exactly how it was spelt and what the game told me to do.  They've also slaughtered the Source engine, it's no wonder we don't have Half-Life 3. Valve had to make another engine after this game was released.  Also, for those of you that like your Source console commands and your Postal experience in 1st person mode. You get to eat ♥♥♥♥ because typing firstperson into the console tells you that the game is already in first person. (even though the whole game takes place in 3rd person). Entering thirdperson makes the camera aim straight at the floor. So instead of using the default 3rd person mode that Source uses they've decided to use the first person mode and pull the camera back, for some reason.   I was also told not to press a button, so I'm not whilst I currently wait for the game to progress. After I spent waiting the game started to insult me for doing exactly what it told me to do.   The people that made this game should kill themselves. I'm not joking. They've made a mess of the Source engine and a mess of the Postal series.",0
It is the shiteist game ever buy postal 2 it works and is actuly ♥♥♥♥ing fun I wish i never bought this abomanation of a game this game killed the series and valve your machans dont work for this game and its in 3rd person no aiming and the brige took me 30 min just to finnish sorry if i misspeled i am just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off,0
Very Bad Game Postal 2 is more good,0
The game has it's charm. But i'm much more the FPS version. Also too much loading between the maps hardly make it 'open world'.,0
Honestly not worth $20. It looked fun from the trailer but ened up being a crap game with horroble story and gameplay. Metascore was generous of giving it a 24.,0
"I love Postal and all, but postal 3 was totally trashed, the game is a nutshell of crashes and bugs, i wish i could play this to the end, but even that is impossible due to the fact this game crashes every 5 min from every little thing that pops out.  If you look to play Postal, just buy POSTAL 2.",0
"If you are even remotely thinking of buying this game, go buy Postal 2 first. Postal 3 is developed by Trashmasters (some would say they 'trashed' the game) and published by Akella (as opposed to Running with Scissors who both published an developed the previous game). Trashmasters left out the key concepts that made Postal 2 a good game. Very much a linear game no open world. The only benefit of playing this game is that when you eventually play Postal 2 it looks like a frikin' masterpiece compared to this.",0
This is an extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game the metascore pretty much says it all.,0
The most shortest game ever made! 11/10 - IGN,0
"♥♥♥♥ this game, buy postal 2 instead",0
"this game is a waste of pixels and time. Its a huge piece of ♥♥♥♥, do not buy or play it.",0
"It´s for sure the worst game i know... if you buy it, you will regret it!",0
Really not woth it.   Better to keep on playing postal 2.,0
"DONT BUY THIS CRAP - wow i played it for a long (0,7 hrs) time but i dont have any patience to play THIS any more...uninstalled.. I should trust the score of 24/100 ",0
"So,i have been a big fan of postal 2 in the past for it is one of my favorite games. Back in 2011 i find out that the third postal game was released,So i heard bad reviews so i did not get the game until 3 yrs later (2014) i had a steam card and i had some money left so i thought what the heck i should buy the third postal game,ummm...so i did and well...this game has ruined the postal 3 franchise! it is terrible for it is filled with forced jokes and glitches EVERYWHERE! listen if this means anything to you,don't buy this game PLEASE BUY POSTAL 2!",0
They didn't even bother to make a game out of this ... I had high hopes for this but it ended up being very disapointing. What little gameplay there was ... was very simple and boring. Refund! &gt;:(,0
"Crashes constantly, doesn't control well, isn't funny, doesn't feature a sniper rifle, limits the player too much, and it takes way too many bullets to kill average people. Most of what made the previous game fun is lost. Due to the constant crashing, I really wish I hadn't spent $20 on this. If I could uninstall for a refund, I wouldn't hesitate.",0
"Broken combat, horrible story, and game crashes after swat level so it's impossible for me to complete. Absolute garbage. Play Postal 2.",0
It sucks ♥♥♥♥ and does the franchise more shame than Uwe could do with all of the nazi gold in the world. I ♥♥♥♥ing hate you Akella. Why not go full bankrupt if you go full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and release such an unfinished unpolished piece of ♥♥♥ trash anyway?,0
Be carefull. Game is not running on Windows 8. :(,0
Buggy and ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Can still ♥♥♥♥ on ppl though,0
a 6 hour game not worth it,0

how the ♥♥♥♥ is this game still considered 'mixed',0
"I bought this game for 6 dollars, but it doesn't work! Serial code error! Why? I payed money, but my serial code is not working! Don't buy this game!",0
"Postal 3 is a piece of ♥♥♥♥! I'm ♥♥♥♥in serious!  This game is a ♥♥♥♥in bomb and its one hell of a bad bomb. The gameplay is buggy as hell, the cutscenes are annoying, AI is terrible, missions are lame, story didn't make much sense, too much ♥♥♥♥ is in your way, you get lost very easily, jokes are unfunny, Postal Dude's voice actor is different (not that it matters), and a whole bunch os other crap that made this game suck so hard. Even though this was on the Source engine, I know Valve was pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at these guys for makin it suck so bad. Pretty much a good reason why Valve didn't want this game to be released on STEAM on its release date so the developers had to make it where you have to purchase on their own website.  Do yourself a favor and don't spend your $40 on this horrible game. If you were DARED to buy this and play it all the way to the end, just remove that friend. Postal 2 is a lot more better than this...hell Duke Nukem Forever is better than this pile of ♥♥♥♥.  1/10!...NO MAKE IT -1/10! AVOID IT!",0
i feel violated and not in a good way,0
just buy postal 2 and not this ♥♥♥♥,0
"What ever you think this game is going to be, it's worse.",0
"I feel like i have brain cancer now let me tell ya about it!  The npc's will aim at each other throught walls making a FOLLOW ME! mission annoying as hell. The third person makes things like gasoline and aiming useless.  And if you have a computer that can run games pretty good. Not somthing like a mega machine but it can run games ok. THEN DONT GET THIS GAME!   all the level's are completely massive and have textures that lag the game for no reason and because these level's are massive half of the level you dont see anyway. Because you either get chased by 10 enemy's with melee weapon's or your objective is in a set area so there is no piont of exploreing anyway!  The jokes are either completly bad or pretty funny more bad than good thought. lip synce is terible people will talk and continue to move thier mouths.  The mission are also bad too the story is 'He walks here he does this. He goes there he does that.' There is no variation.  All the guns feel absolutly useless the only weapon you will use is the shotgun, rifle, or M-60. which pulls apart the jokes that can be made is you use the other weapon's.  The third person aim dot is WAY OFF were it is supposed to be you offter shoot a gun for 5 seconds before learning where the bullets are really going and push up your mouse to start hitting somone.  The toturial is a joke quick scene's of your character saying 'OOOOH!!! cool weapon' then a scene with small text tells you how to use the weapon.  I found no possitive in playing this game in fact I just bought postal 2 which i hear is a much better game then postal 3.  Which also makes me ask how is the pervious game better then the newest? I didn't know this was call of duty?!  I am telling you DONT BUY THIS GAME you will regret it just by playing level 1.

This is not a bad game apart from the DRM which is god awful and not supported in either Windows 7 or 10 i wish they'd patch that out if they did i might even recomend the game but while i can't play it i can't recommend it unfortunately go play Postal 2 it's much better and the developers (not the same as this game) actually care and still update the game to this day.,0

(the ending was actually pretty epic with the tank battle)     The fact that this alone allows you to draw out the gameplay factor a bit does kind of give it a replay value... Kind Of....

"Hey it is finally on steam! This game will likely get low scores and upset fanboys because it comes accross as a parody of itself. Anyways: It is a Third Person action game with tons of random and sick humor in small mission based levels.   The method you use to solve the missions are very limited compared to Postal 2 because either you do things in a evil way or a good way... how you do the missions results in what type of mission you do next.   You could play the whole game killing everyone and getting evil missions or as a cop doing good things and saving people. The whole game has alternative pathways so since I did a good guy, I missed at least 1/3 of the game of bad guy levels.  The weapons are fun and killing people is fun, but overall the game feels rushed and humor is forced. Not worth the $40.00, but I could say it would be worth $20.00 if you love sick humor and killing people with strange weapons like killer Cats.",0

The missions make no sense, the enemies are either too stupid to kill you; or, kill you in mere seconds without any chance of you doing anything about it.   The game runs at a staggering, mindblowing, ten frames per seconds at nearly all times. The voice acting is atrocious, the NPCs could not be any more vapid and shallow. The guns are unsatisfying, and most of the other weapons are just plain stupid and have no purpose other than shock value.   I can't wrap my mind around how this 'game' ever got the green light to get this far. Please, only consider installing this 'game' if they pay you to do so. Stay away from this distasteful, poor designed 'game' that was clearly made by immature ten-year-olds. Because, no matter how you slice it, it was clearly targeted for them, too.

Not sure what made Running With Scissors take the leap from Unreal Engine in Postal 2 to Source in Postal III. Not sure what they expected in adding zombies to Postal, or forcing really annoying combat encounters, or never really giving you a moment to properly understand what's happening. This game tries too hard to be offensive, yet funny, to have stuff to do, in a world with nothing to do, to have a story in a series that never had one, and decals constantly overlap one another. Voice-acting is overall poor, and even for people that like low-brow humor (like myself) this game just takes it too far. It's not funny, it's just annoying.  + Kill Uwe Boll + Weapons + Postal violence  - Annoying fourth wall breaks - Possibly the worst use of Source Engine I've ever seen - Glitches galore! - Annoying voice acting - Never a moment's peace to explore and just do whatever I want, like in Postal 2 - Combat that's sometimes WAY too annoying - Zombies, in Postal - Tries too hard to do too many things at once",0

"Runespell Overture is a card game with kind of original mechanic, blending the combinations from poker with tactical moves from Arcomage - where you collecting some points to use them on some spell, which will either attack your opponent or defend yourself better.  Point one is that it is NOT a Role-Play Game, it is only a card game with 'health points' on you and your enemies, and some grades of combinations to win the hand. Point two is that Arcomage - and many games alike - are still Much Better by the terms of gameplay.  As a Pro point, I like the visual stylistics of the Runespell, the way it's presenting itself - it has a good facade, so to say. Game mechanic and scenario combined creating good impression, which follows you in first third, maybe first half of the whole game. But then... then you notice, that the challenge is not anything intense, and just proceeding using quite the same basic combinations - basically doing all the same over and over... and at that point, you'll be not so happy.  The story is okay for that type of game... but nothing fancy or really rewarding for your struggle to beat dozens of almost similar enemies - and even bosses are not much different! To finish the impression, Runespell: Overture is maybe short (about 5-10 hours of gameplay), but holds one bugged achievement, which I can't complete even after 30+ hours... do I need to tell you how I love such things?  Oh, well, I'll just mark it with 5.5/10, and leave it be. Do not recommend, as there are enough of better card games, even in the F2P ghetto.",0
"As a fan of poker and Rpgs i thought this would be a pretty interersting and fun game....i was half right  It seems well enough when you begin. You try to get a combintaion of 5 cards, the attack power being determined on how well it corrosponds to to the poker hierarchy and try to wittle down you're opponents hp. simple enough.  You are introduced to spells shortly after, assuming this is where the tactics come in.....well not really.  The main problem with this game is that it is barely like poker at all and barely an RPG. The attack points could be determined by...pretty much anything else..infact it might benifit from this as what happens 90% is you and even the A.I end up making as many pairs and then full house's as you can with usually lower damage if you try anything else in addition to being harder to achieve. There almost no point in making a higher hand than you're opponent as all it does is take off slightly more hp...i mean ♥♥♥♥ i some what assumed that it might nullify one of his hands....or something..you know kinda like POKER.  The spells offer SOME varity and tactics but not much, the cost vs reward of most spells make them mostly interchangeable.....its kinda amazing actually how there could be so much varity and yet so little.  Overall the only people i can recommend this game to is to someone who wants a simple card game that has some odd and fairly unique mechanics..........but mostly it is a dissapointment and wasted potiental.",0
"I got this as part of a bundle and really tried to make it work for me, but it was hard to escape the 'solitare with animations' feeling I got from the game. I'm sure a greater enthusiast for card games will find something they like in here, but I could not recommend it to a general audience.",0
"Make sure you like the core poker-styled game mechanic before you buy because that (and the nice presentation) carry the game. If you like the gameplay, this would be a good game for you. If you're unsure or not especially enthused, there are other games that might suit you better.  Took me a couple of tries to finish the game; I stopped playing and restarted a couple times because I got bored with the game mechanic or early grinding for silver.  Not a very long game once you learn how to properly win games. The story is really like a prelude to the 'real story' which is never revealed. The ending is pretty lackluster. As far as I can tell, there is no reason to Continue+ (for achievements, it's better to just not do the last stage so don't have to unlock all the map again).  Almost all allies are either impractical or unnecessary. Hrodbrokk is a pretty good source of damage for the RP/AP it takes; Brin is usually a waste of a turn because you should be better off moving cards around for bigger damage and using the RP elsewhere.",0
"I feel that this would've been more fun if the spells and abilities were more than just 'do damage', also as the game progresses your sole upgrade is more HP/MP, without any increases in damage potential, so battles at the end just end up being a long slugfest.",0
"This game is not bad. It does not anger me, disappoint me, or rub me the wrong way. It's just kinda there. The game plays like a cross between poker and solitaire. You see your stacks of cards (top card only per stack, like in solitaire), and you see the same for your opponent. You move cards around like in solitaire, stacking them on other cards, except you're trying to make combinations of five cards, which can be poker combos like flushes, straights, etc. You then use those to attack your enemy, and vice versa. You have bonus card thingies on the side of your screen that you can use to attack when you build up enough rage.  It's an okay premise, but it doesn't really seem to change and the story is just okay. It's one of the least compelling games I've played. I have nothing against this game, which is really saying something. I typically love or hate a game, but this one is just kinda meh. I wouldn't recomment paying more than a Steam sale price, by any means, but I'd recommend you play the demo if you're interested. The gameplay you experience in 20-30 minutes of that is pretty much the entirety of the gameplay from what I've seen thus far. It's not very exciting or interesting, and nothing draws me in to make me want to keep playing. It's an okay game, but that's it.",0
"Promising start, with really polished UI and tutorial, but game crashes upon leaving the first village, and there's no known solution nor support available. Until I figure it out, or find a computer on which it doesn't crash, I cannot give a better review. But watch out for this if you want to buy the game.",0
"A very odd take on poker mechanics crossed with RPG battles. I just dont care for the strategy here. Just another game where I get to an impossible point after a couple hours with no clue what I could be doing wrong. Eh, I give. Uninstalled. I'd sooner suggest people try Puzzle Quest 2 for this kind of asthetic.",0
"Marvelously fun game. Major set back: Even on the lowest graphics setting, the infernal game chops like there's no tomorrow. I've played 2 hours, then took a break. Now when I try to load her up, the game chops for 5+ minutes till I get bored and quit. And wehn I say chops, I mean the music cuts in and out and you can't interact at all.  The developers have an awesome idea for a game, it's great fun - but unplayable by virtue of their execution.",0
"Though i was addicted to it and played maybe 2,5 times to collect all the achievements, can't really recommend it, unless for a big discount. Gameplay is repetitive and becomes stale quickly (collect pocker hands to create attacks). Additional magic spell add a bit flavor. Also the story was interesting. Oh, and the epic music playing all the time becomes annoying after a few minutes :)",0
A good game in the beginning but later it gets boring and eventually even frustrating.,0
Does not work in Mac OS 10.9 or 10.10. No support available from the company.,0
"Poker meets Solitare - suprisingly shallow puzzle adventure, but if your into poker, you probably can't beat it for the price..",0
"As a avid player of Match-3 games, and appreciator of the Puzzle Quest saga, I convinced myself to give Runespell: Overture a shot, intrigued by the fact you play with a standard deck of cards instead of coloured gems.  The first battles were interesting, the poker-like combos felt novel. Diving more deeply into the game, it got more depth with the addition of magic cards and sidekicks.  Unfortunately, it appeared that most of the magic cards are just copies of the same basic spell (unlike other games where fire, ice, lightning and poison have different tactical effects).  From that point, the battles felt too much similar to sustain interest, and the constant sight of these clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades turned the fantasy background into the trivial one your regular Solitaire.  These kind of games are supposed to be easy to develop on a reasonable budget, deliberately limiting fancy graphics to focus solely on gameplay depth. Sadly, this game is a living testimony of a team being too lazy or too tired to make a truly great game.   Maybe they lost faith in this game at some point. No wonder this happened to me too.",0
"6/10  Its a game worth a try but only worth a try.Campaign is not that boring and can be attractive to some players.Also have a unique concept. There are 2 deadly flaws in this title in my opinion: 1.Too many useless battles,so you usually get bored after 2hours 2.The limited times to use skills,for more times?you need to buy at a high price in store.I really dont know why design like this,so the game gets more and more boring because you dont want to try different skills but only want to end every battle fast,its a big failure.But enemies dont,they always have 10+times to use and they only mean to get you stucked one time,so more and more hard battles but looked the same.",0
"game keep crashing at a certain point every time, i tried starting over with a new campain and it keeps effecting it and crashs as soon as i get into the game.. dont waste your money on only a few hours worth of game before it crashs. and you might think its just my computer doing because of my graphivcs card or something, but ive tried it again after replacing my graphics card",0
WIll not open on mac.,0
i would not recommend this game at all - total snooze ..... everything is great except the game play mechanics.,0
"Hard to tell the difference between clubs and spades especially. Sometimes I make the wrong diamonds and hearts also. Fix this, please.",0
A pretty unique concept but another of the worst games I've ever played. First boss of the tutorial is too overpowered and I can't beat him no matter what I do. There's better things out there to play. I'm done with this frustrating and stupefying game.,0
"The core gameplay mechanic is original and fun, but I couldn't play enough of it for that to matter. For many people, the game crashes after reaching the first village. Just freezes and can't be unfrozen. Some people say they fix it by disabling 'Raptr,' but I don't even know what that is, and it doesn't appear to be even installed on my computer. If I ever manage to solve this problem, I can give a better review, but for now, I have to say that a game with such a massive bug isn't worth gambling on. Furthermore, there is a lot of dialogue and 'story,' but all of it is just horribly written. I mean really, really painful to read, and you have to go through it all. And if there is dialogue at the start of a fight (usually seems to be) and you die during that fight you have to click through it all again. I feel the game would be better if they either hired a proper writer for the story, or just gave it a bare bones plot and let the player enjoy the actual battles more, without having to suffer through the dialogues. Maybe add a 'skip' button.  Again, I've only played the tutorial, because I can't get it to work past that. It's possible it gets better, though writing that bad in a game doesn't tend to improve. I suppose my real hope would be that there would simply be less of it. If I ever get the game working, I will give it more of a chance, because the combat is quite interesting, and then I will update my review with a more informed experience.",0
"I've tried on three separate occasions to gain momentum with this game, with no success. It is flat-out boring, in my opinion. Unless you already enjoy card games, you will probably not enjoy Runespell: Overture. The design of the game is actually fairly nice, but gameplay is extremely repetitive.",0

"Eh, it's basically poker.  The only real variations are you can have 5 of a kind and there are magic abilities which you can use the better hands you make.  The plot is somewhat interesting but not really that original. You basically suffer from amnesia and you happen to be the chosen one to save everyone.  If you like poker... I recommend playing poker. If you like the fantasy aspect I recommend any number of other fantasy games. Even if you like both having 2 good games is better than having one mediocre one.",0

In S&amp;P2, your spells directly affect the poker grid, which allows you to make better, deadlier poker hands. Which is fun. In Runespell, the spells do NOT let me affect the solitaire/poker game. They just let end it faster.  In S&amp;P2, you actually feel like you're playing (a weird variant of) poker. In Runespell, the game is much closer to Klondike solitaire. (Fairway Solitaire was fun, but this isn't.)  In S&amp;P2, the story is 'Go poker cute monsters to death to save the world... again' In Runespell, there's this ridiculous grimdark story because you fight everyone with solitaire and poker's UGLY child.  In S&amp;P2, you have incentive to not just defeat the enemy, but to do  well  - you only get a few healing potions per level, so the better you fight, the more health you'll have in the next battle. In Runespell, you heal fully between every fight so who cares as long as you win.",0
"This is one of those games where you play it for a bit and then you get stuck. On the plus side, the main menu music is awesome.",0
"This game gave me AIDS,Herpes,Hepatitis,Cancer,Syphilis,Erectile Dysfunction and Tourettes. ♥♥♥♥ this game and it's preferred soft drink brand, I would rather have sex with the letter 69 then play another second of this ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal game. 10/10",0
Play Solitaire instead.,0
"Sorta easy to follow uncomplex card game with a pretty unsatisfying combat mechanic. I enjoyed it to start with and it quickly got boring.,",0
"I've played deeper mobile games. It plays like one of those touch screen dive bar games.  I'm a big fan of the weird RPG-Poker niche subgenre of games so I was pretty excited about this, but it lets down in every way possible.  This game is basically just a battle system, there is very little connecting fight to fight. Simplistic map and boringly presented text and portrait story. That would be fine if the battle system had anything going on... but it doesn't.  The battle system has an interesting idea buried in it, but nothing is done with it. All the magic in the game is just *DO X-Y Damage* *Block X points of Nature Damage* There is no cards for board or number or hand manipulation. This makes collecting cards seem pointless because none of them actually change your play style. The way you play your first battle is how you play your last. There is also zero consequences for death so battles have no tension.  As for the RPG mechanics... well there aren't really any. Your HP and MP go up at set story points and I guess you can choose to cast a spell that does X points fire damage or X points nature damage, but there is so little reason to bother I can't see why you would.   Story is okay, I guess, soundtrack is decent, but I can't imagine that being enough to get you through this mindless slog. If you ever thought 'I wish I had to click through a bunch of text between Freecell games' then this might be for you.",0
"I wouldn't recommend this one. Just play couple of battles and you've pretty much seen it all. The game is tedious even if you manage to play it through in a couple of hours. The story is pretty indefferent: something about fantasy creatures roaming in Dark age Europe and mythic religious references. Sure if you're a fan of new card games, then go ahead and invest. Something new which get old pretty fast.",0
it's like solitaire with someone punching you in the face every few minutes and then slapping your cards off the table,0
"Ho hum. Incomplete - a prologue to a vaporware game. The card graphics are simply ordinary playing cards, the story is slight to the point of invisibility and totally linear. The gameplay is mildly amusing, maybe a fraction above playing MS Solitaire, but not complex enough to reward paying it much attention. Worth a dollar or two purely as a solitaire game, but certainly not worth paying even close to full price for.",0
"Neat Concept, but in the end too short and too easy",0
"I have tried repeatedly to get into this game and I just can't. I find it dreadfully boring and I usually like games that do the puzzle quest thing. I'd skip this unless you really like the idea of playing a poker/solitaire mashup a puzzle quest-esque progression. Trust me, it's not as interesting as it sounds.",0
Weird gin rummy game.,0
"It's a poker game, mixed with an rpg element. Pretty shallow. Difficulty scaling is pretty messed up?",0
5 battles in and the repetitiveness of the game has already turned me off to it. Not to mention there is no volume slider to adjust the sound just on and off buttons. I'm not adjusting the computer sound and all of the background things I have going on just to hear the sound on this game.,0
Don't let the tags fool you; this is not an RPG. A Royal Flush deals the same amount of damage in hour 1 as it does in hour 5. My 1st steam purchase where I felt I wasted my money.,0
Cannot change volume,0
"It's oké, but not really cool. I wish there was a neutral button, because I wouldn't recommend, but also I can't call this game bad. Luckily there is a demo, so you can try, sadly it doesnt get more interesting after you buy the game when the demo finishes.",0
"Appallingly awful - spent ages setting things up, then ended abruptly in a ridiculous way that bore no relation to anything that had happened up to that point. Voice acting ranged from average (main character) to laughably bad (hotel manager).",0
"you might think that a hotel owned by a dead mountaineer would be interesting but actually this game will make you want to die, much like that mountaineer, who is dead, as the game's title explains, and also several signs and paintings in the hotel which are of a dead mountaineer please don't buy this game",0
I disliked the voice acting and controls in this game.,0
"Dead Mountaineer's Hotel is a game based on the novel of the same name by the Strugatsky brothers, the generally pretty great Russian sci-fi authors who also wrote books like Roadside Picnic, which was the basis of the movie which was in turn the basis of the STALKER series. I've never read this particular book, but I figured anything related to them couldn't possibly turn out that bad. I was horribly wrong, but I don't need to tell you that, because I doubt anyone was actually planning on buying this game to begin with. But I'm going to go over it anyways because I need a therapeutic rant session to recover from playing it.  The first thing you'll notice within five seconds of starting the game is that the voice acting is absolutely terrible. Just listen to the opening dialogue of the game, and you'll see what I mean:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRYvubs4MQs  . Well, actually the first thing you'll notice is that despite originally releasing in 2007 the game only runs in one resolution, and it's 1024 x 768 and cannot be changed, but still. There are one or two actors who border on decent, but for the most part the game sounds as if they hired a bunch of bums off the street and paid them in bread to do the voice acting for the game. It's kind of hilarious, and was mainly what kept me playing through the game, but it also made the story impossible to take seriously.  Luckily, there really isn't much story. Again, I've never read the novel this was based off of, but I highly doubt it went quite like this. You spent the first four or five hours of the game doing absolutely nothing relevant to the plot, mainly involving stupid puzzles like helping the hotel owner fix the room service call system that never gets used again, or choosing a dinner from various categories that doesn't cause the other guests to laugh at your choice (I don't know why having too many vegetables in your meal is grounds for making you redo a 'puzzle', but what do I know?), or playing billiards with another character that isn't even really a puzzle so much as just a billiards flash game implanted into the game. Then in the last 20 minutes or so of the game the story finally starts, you talk to each of the hotel's residents, and then it ends, and the game explains the story to you.   As you might have gathered from that last bit, the store page is pretty misleading. It mentions '15+ hours of gameplay', but I finished it in less than 6 and I can't imagine it taking 15 hours unless you just get lost in the unnecessarily large hotel. The store page also makes it seem as if the hotel guests have AI routines and go about their own lives, hinting at a system something like how Deadly Premonition's characters go about their day, but the game doesn't have any sort of time system and the characters just move from place to place as you solve the puzzles like in any adventure game. I used to think RunAway was the worst point-and-click adventure game I'd ever played, but I'm not sure if anything will ever top this one.",0
"'A call button... purple maybe....'  OPTION A: *PRESS IT?* OPTION B: *DON'T PRESS IT?*  *SELECTED: OPTION A*  '...PRESS it...!' *Presses button.  And then... well... yes.  CONS:   1) Bad voice acting: Atrocious. 2) Gordon Ramsay didn't give his permission to be the main character, or in costume. 3) The ending.  PROS:   1) It's so stupid it's amusing at times. 2) A dog is a scholar, apparently.  Do I recommend? Oh gawd, no.   Was it gifted to you? Good luck with that!  ..then again, it's so bad it's amusing... watch a 'Let's Play' or something instead :)",0
"The voice acting has got to be some of the worst of any game. The navigation is incredibuly slow and the puzzle are little more than pixel hunt fetch quests. The few actual puzzles that can be called that are just, well, bad...",0
"Awfull simply awfull, i must have played over 400 adventure games in my life and this is probably the worst  got a good laugh out of it tho like when you peer through this hotel window and bad techno music starts playing  so random",0
"There's some good stuff here, interesting characters, and setting thanks to the novel it's based. I would say it's better than the film of that novel, which can be seen on youtube, but it's all so very slow, the hotel is quite large and as soon as your character gets to one end of it, he's sent back to the other. Also there are too many puzzles and tasks which don't actually require any puzzling. I would recommend it if you're interested in the Strugatsky brothers (of Stalker(aka Roadside Picnic) the Inhabited Island, and Hard to Be a God) but not to anyone else.",0
"I had initially planned to reserve this feature only for providing positive input on games that I truly felt deserved some attention that they might not generally get, but I've given this some thought and think people really need to be warned about how bad this game really is because the pictures can be deceiving.  The art is nice. I will give it that. However the atmosphere is ruined at literally the FIRST moment one of the two initial characters you see speaks, as their voice acting is some of the worst I have ever heard. These people's voices would not be out of place in a film like The Room. There is also absolutely no introductory exposition. The main character (whoever he is, I think he's a cop, could be wrong) immediately starts angrily grilling people on things with nothing to explain his motivation or why the player should care. Add on the terrible voice acting and things get very painful, very fast.  As well as no explanation of the story, there is also no explanation of the controls. I figured out the basics of moving and picking things up as that's as generic as can be, but upon reaching my first real puzzle I was completely at a loss as to how I should be manipulating the items in my inventory or making use of them in the environment. I poked and prodded, clicked and reclicked and what should've been a very, very simple task of just poking the end of a key to make it fall out of the lock on the other side of the door turned into an impossible task when nothing I did registered. This is where I gave up on the game in disgust.  I purchsed this game for $2.50. I do not feel it was worth that amount. You have all now been warned.",0
"The good news: Steam has finally allowed users to hide games from their libraries The bad news: I bought this game. I don't remember how. I just did. I hope it was on a sale.  Luckily, I have a guide for you on how to hide your shame from your library. Or my shame.  Step 1: Right-click --&gt; Properties Step 2: Set Categories ---&gt; Check the checkbox with 'Hide game in my library'  Now give yourself a pat on the back.",0
"Worst, voice acting, ever. Like the guys at CAPCOM would be laughing.",0
"I like point and click adventure games, but didn't like this one at all. The voice acting was very bland, like they read from a script and that's it. The hints of what to do or who to speak to were either vague or non existant. And the story wasn't that great to begin with, and got even weirder near the end. Even if you like adventure games, with no replayability, you would do well to avoid this one, and get something else instead.",0
"Technical issues, worst voice acting I've ever heard, boring plot, pixel hunting and so on. Crap, crap, crap on crap.",0
The voice acting in the English version is amongst the worst that I have heard anywhere. I would rate it as almost unplayable. In German however it is a different story. My German is very poor indeed but having already heard the intro in English I could fill in the gaps of the German version. It really was better acting. It is possible that this game deserves a thumbs up for the story and visuals but I will have to park it until I get better with my German. A great shame.,0
"While this might look like an Agatha Christie-esque adventure game, steer clear. This game gets just about everything wrong, from the pixel hunting down to the straight up awful story and characters. At best, you might get some enjoyment out of the horrendous voice acting, but that's almost certainly not worth the price of admission.",0
Voice acting alone killed it for me. I would just call it voice reading a script.,0
I wanted to like this game.   This game wanted to play billiards.,0
"Although the concept sounds good on paper, Dead Mountaineer's Hotel is by no means a good game.  The key hook, the murder, happens too late to really draw you in, and while the mountaintop hotel is pleasant to look at, it is filled with barely noticable items, and can rapidly become a nightmarish maze if you don't pick up the easily missable map at the start of the game.  Puzzle solutions are either esoteric or require scouring the entire hotel for a misplaced item, the best ending requires completing an infuriating mini-game of snooker, and the voice acting and character animations are shoddy (although if you consider the absurb plot twist at the end, these lacklustre performances are all perfectly explicable). Peter Glebsky (your character) constantly sounds incredulous, although on the plus side, he does vaguely resemble Richard Armitage.  Don't climb this mountain.",0
Its hard to say bad things about a game on a review. Well atleast for me. I found the art attractive when i was looking to purchase it. But once I started to play the game it went done hill fast. Its just not fun. 2 out of 10 for me. 4th worst steam game I bought. Sorry.,0
Great game but the puzzles are nearly impossible. Don't recommend buying this unless its .25 cents on sale.,0
"Absolute. Waste. Of. Time. This game was gifted to me, so I went ahead and gave it a go. The graphics aren't too bad -- if you don't mind laziness. Objects were recycled from scene to scene, and sometimes not even altered or rotated. The script is also terribly rigid. Your cursor will show you various places you can click to go -- but you HAVE to follow the script and can only make one -right- choice every time. That aside, the worst part of the game is the dialogue. I don't know if they had a deadline to meet or what, but the voice actors sound like they're reading the script cold and have no idea how to inflect any sort of emotion into what they're saying. It's torture to listen to. For that reason, it's likely I may never finish this game. /Anti-Recommendation",0
"Game breaking bugs, awful music in constant loop and the most boring dialogue I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing.",0
You can find better flash games for free,0
It's bad... trust me....,0
"First off it should be mentioned that 'Dead moutaineer's hotel' is an old russian movie, which would be fine if the store page would mention it, so you could research the movie at least a bit in advance.  Both Knox and VanDine would turn in their graves when seeing this misleading summary, that actually makes you think this is a fair and square detective mystery, while it actually isn't. And even if you are tolerant enough to call it a detective mystery you will soon find out that it isn't fair at all, since:     The number of clues telling you that everyone here is an alien robot,built to observe humanity is exactly zero.  Rather late in the game you get a clue that aliens might be somehow involved, by finding a strange device which would as well be a very sophisticated bomb.  But no matter how you look at it, its not enough of a hint to make you even remotely aware that EVERYONE (the detective included) is just an alien robot. The only remote clues in that regard you ever get is hearing that one of the cast apparently carried out some superhuman task (Think it was carrying a safe on her shoulders), as well as aforementioned strange device. - Notably very close to the end of the story.  But even if you consider this a detective mystery with sci-fi elements this clue, as well as the device simply come to late for you to be able to make 'xyz and txz are in fact alien robots.   And yet again, even if you would consider this a valid clue, there is no clue at all that you, the detective himself and the entire rest of the cast, is one of these robots too.     As a movie adaption - passable  As the detective story it pretends to be however it fails hard.",0
"Worst. Game. Ever...  I continued to wait for the game to begin all the way until the credits rolled.   There is so much wrong with this game, i continued to play thinking surely it must get better, but honestly, trust every other review when they say this is the worst game ever.   • The voice acting is terrible, i've heard more heart felt believable conversations with my pet cat. Voice acting isnt a make or break for a game but still its a major minus.   • There is no story!!! Im on a holiday break, the hotel is named after a dead mountaineer, it has a museum room which was once his. Ok. Some one's been smoking in the room and there are some shoes which dont belong there. Hardly a case for Scooby Doo. Then thats kind of it, you spend the entire game following idle tasks with no story, no reason other than to advance the game. then when the end does come you simply dont care.  • It's really slow! You walk everywhere, there is no option to run, even in a hurry 'Quick, we have to get guy on the roof here because his friend is badly injured, slowely walks to roof.' there are some scenes where you can double click and fast travel through the room without having to actually walk the entire room, but yea this plays really slow and clunky.   • You will not care about anyone. I didnt even bother to learn their names, i really wanted this to be a good game, i thought from looking at it a steam sale that it could be good, but no, coupled with the bad voice acting you find yourself unable to connect with any of the characters.   There is a plot twist at the end. at least if there was a plot, there would be the twist but for me and my experiance, it was the beginning of the story, which then ended some 2 paragraphs later. And while im on it, as a plot twist its utterly wank.   Buy this game only if you have played every other game on steam... and only if it comes on sale for £1... and only if you get that £1 from someone else.",0
Someone made this game completely at home. Voice-overs: Nails on chalkboard. Total $hit.,0
"still have,no mouse the only patch i can find is not in english so i cant play the game ,can anyone help please .",0
"This was pretty confusing, I wound up having to track down a walkthrough pretty quickly. Voices are okay but direction is not - you coud tell they were just reading what they were given with no context. Some more $$ thrown into localization would've helped. Maybe other languages are better.   Apparently this is based off of a novel. Maybe reading that first would've helped make the game more sense, but playing this first makes me completely uninterested in trying to find the novel.",0
"Ready for a mystery game? Then grab scooby doo jump in the mystery and drive it off a cliff, just end it all now if you plan on finishing this game.  The voice acting sounds literally like their reading off a page, no matter what the characters are doing, walking, or running, in danger, their voice stays the same flat or unconcerned. Get ready for ALOT of bad voice acting since this game is story driven. The main character sounds angry at everything when he talks, just looking at in game items makes him mad. I am guessing he is mad for being in one of the worst games ever made. I got five minutes into the game and got stuck, unable to continue, with no hint system or anything I turned it off and deleted it.  Every single time you move to another screen the game loads like an old Resident evil game, except in this game its not passing through a door, just walking to the other side of a room makes the game load. This game is so bad it makes you feel dirty for owning it, the kind of dirty you cant wash off.   Rating: 0/10 Value: $-9.99 (Notice that is negative, we should be PAYED to play crap like this!)",0
"In short: boring, pointless and confusing.  Longer version: I'm a sucker for this kind of adventures and pride myself for having a very high tolerance. This one certainly looked nice when looking at the screenshots and reading the intro. But when you get in the game there's nothing happening. One wanders around the hotel, clicking through all the dialogs, picking up stuff, solving a few puzzles, yet still doesn't get any idea what this game is about.  And that's the main problem. I couldn't figure out what to do! The dialogs are stiff and boring and I got sick of seeing the same scenes over and over again as I had to constantly clicking my way through the hotel.  Summary: Spend your money on another game. This one is no fun and is one of the very few adventures I actually stopped playing. I didn't event want to consult a walkthrough. I just can't be bothered.",0
Very mediocre and uninspiring game. Paying for it more then a couple quid is just waste of money. Only buy if it is on a massive sale and you are desperate for an adventure game. ,0
Do not buy this game ... does not work even after many efforts ... click on it only if you want to give away your money for nothing,0
"This game is awful. And the more awful thing is I have finished the game. And the most awful thing is I have finished and watched all of the three endings. I just can't forget this awful game that I have finished YEARS AGO.  The voice acting is awful, but it's nothing. It's the worst voice acting I've ever heard in a game, but that really is nothing! Because, you think the graphic and atomsphere looks good, so you think the story should be fascinating, at least not bad, right? WOW, snow storm, mountainners, serial killer in a hotel? NO!!!  This game tought me one thing that I will never forget. That is, if most people say the game is bad, really bad, then it IS bad. Don't try to think about buying it. If you just can't keep yourself calm and think wisely to not buy it, then don't play it! Don't even try to think about it, DO NOT! REALLY! You'll regret throwing your money away, but it's not a big deal, it's nothing!!! The most horrible thing is you'll then get punished by the game and you WILL DEEPLY DEEPLY REGRET what you have played. This horrible game does not punish you at the begining or in the middle of the game, it punishes you in its endings. It has three endings so you can get punished three times if you want to, and you will want to because you just can't help getting the other two punishments after the first one. And you'll regret and never forget that! FOR YEARS!",0
"As of right now, not reccommending this game. Extremley slow pace and terrible voice acting. Your character always seems to answer things with an attitude all the time and when talking to other characters, they talk very slowly. The game doesn't have great graphics, but there is something about them that I like, but that is about it. Don't waste your money though.",0
Uhhhhh...yeah...  Great price but I could only play it for 5min. The voiceovers of the characters is pretty dry and non-interesting. Didn't catch my attention so I'm deleting it from my computer.,0
"ugh... where to start with this game... lets see if i can put this nicely, this game makes me want to punt babies and kittens... broken from the get go and crashes constantly, however the opening scenes are ok. the good thing is that the best part... before it crashes...",0
"played 2 minutes, the voice acting is unbearable, unistalled.",0
"Doesn't work properly without changing game files, installing third party bloatware like DIVX, and basically jumping through way too many hoops.  I wasted more time on Google trying to find ways to fix thios piece of crap than actually attempting to play it.  Ended up uninstalling without having actually played, as the mouse wouldn't work (among other problems), rendering the game unplayable.  I'd almost classify it as malware, but I'll settle for fraud.  It should be removed from the shop, as I'm pretty sure knowingly selling products that don't work isn't exactly legal, but since Valve doesn't seem to care, stay away from it unless youlike wasting money.",0
Do yourself a favor. Don't buy this game. Nothing about it...let me emphasize that again... NOTHING about it is good. NOTHING.,0
"you get the character standing in front of the hotel, and you got through the dialogue up to entering the hotel, and that's it. you have no cursor anywhere on my screen you can't do anything. Why Sell Crap like this. Steam is Going to Crap Selling Crap like this.",0
"Nice, old-scool graphics, reminded me a bit of Syberia. However, story-wise it was a complete blah with no ground for anything and tons of mistakes: You have tons of locaions (rooms) and such, most of which you never need in the game. It makes reacing places so difficult! You have tons of actions which bring nothing to the story.  A number of items which you can view, say what they are and that's it. Usually, this cancels the 'view' action in such games. Once you see it and know what it is, if it's uselss otherwise.. it just mustn't stay active. Here, it's the opposite. You have a generator and a room which you may never 'see'.  Collecting stuff with no need for it.  Tons of useless mini-quests (like seeking for the same item twice).  Idiotic ending.",0
"Good Premise, mediocre execution. Having not played a point-and-click since Titanic, over 14 years ago, I thought I'd try this as the WW2 spy theme seemed interesting. Sadly, it proved nearly unplayable. Someone experienced with this sort of game may do fine, but I struggled to figure out what I was supposed to do and eventually gave up. You have to do so many boring tasks to get something simple done, as if they tried to prevent the game from being to short, instead of making a better longer game. Example (MINOR SPOILERS): struggle to set up spy camera with correct lens (no instructions given), tripod too low for view out of window (seriously?), go back to office and search for taller tripod, try camera again only to find steam from leaky pipe in nearby building blocking view, find someone to fix pipe...take photo...develop photo (no instructions given), give photos to your boss who does not accept them because you apparently had to take more photos (this was never made clear). The game is full of this, tedious and not enough guidance or help. The voice acting is very mediocre (why get sleepy americans to do german voices?). There were also some problems with screen resolution and loading crashes. All in all a pity, as this game clearly had some potential, with great and historically authentic looking visuals. If you like the subject material and have a lot of experience with these sorts of games, you may like it, otherwise, give this a miss as there are probably much better point-and-click games out there.",0
"A Stroke of Fate: Operation Valkyrie is a typical point-and-click adventure containing dry, emotionless, and uninspiring voice actors. They really should have done the game in German with English subtitles or at least cast actors with German accents. But even then, when you supply actors with no personality, it wouldn't have mattered much.  The story takes place after the failed attempt of the original Operation Valkyrie and you play the role of an SS Officer with a secret desire to carry on the mission. Many of the clickable objects provide a mini 1940s German history lesson. It's slightly interesting, but the storytelling is pretty bland making this a boring experience overall.",0
A promising premise ruined by an irritating point and click interface and far too many boring tasks to undertake.,0
" This game is high on promise, but low on delivery. Leaves a lot to be desired as an adventure and a story.",0
"Honestly, biggest fluke of a game I've bought in the past half a year. I cannot say it's a bad game, because I cannot even play it long enough to have an opinion.  Here is what I encountered throughout my c.a. 3 hours of gameplay: 1. Windowed mode at 4:3 resolution which makes a part of the game unreachable (hidden behind my tackbar + going out of my display zone 2. Windowed mode unfixable by alt+enter or by launch commands on Steam 3. Crashed once 4. 5 times the game loaded a scene wrongly, hiding my cursor, my character, and the car, as well as leaving a desk-image on top of everything. I managed to 'fix' the problem by blindly finding the path to a different scene, but it didn't work once. While this happens, I cannot make the menu come up either - so all unsaved data is lost at exiting the game (which at that point was the only option to realise any kind of change).   I strongly recommend the devs to fix all their bugs before presenting us with their games. This is a joke!",0
The game could be really cool - and honestly isn't that bad when you get it to work. Do direct x 9 and you may get it to work for a while but it hard locked my computer after playing for a few minutes.,0
"Barely passable, totally missed out on the Pacific and ALL American boats, there's no customizing boats like the US did, crews are killed off imediatly, missions are hard especially because you can only really control the PT boats and the computer crew is very bad at decision making, such as firing at a target. Tarpedo sights are bad, hip shooting works best. Poorly thought out game overall.",0
the game has great graphics but that's about it. The interface is dificult to understand and hard to use. The tutorials are confusing. Needs a lot of work to be playable.,0
"Very poor, promises plenty delivers little, even in the tutorial the interface does not work, plus the horrendous racist german voice overs are enough to completely ruin what could have been a good game, garbage, avoid!",0
"Something different... but rather fussy when it comes to crontrols, graphics, screen size and on/off switchen when running multiple monitors.",0
Annoying waste of time and money with nothing to recommend it,0
This is a truly horrible game. I tried to play it for a couple of days then uninstalled it.,0
Crashes on launch. You must butcher visuals to get it to function. Skip this turd.,0
This is terrible!,0
DO NOT BUY. The game only works for a few lucky people and otherwise it's a total waste of money.,0
"What a disappointment. I wanted to like this game, I really did. I read that it was a decent RPG with good game mechanics and pretty graphics. However, in my experience, the most the game could muster from me is one giant 'meh.'  To start, the good points: Combat in Kingdoms of Amalur is by far it's best feature. Combat is fast, acrobatic, and exciting. Taking down mobs of enemies with a variety of weapons while dodging and firing off magic spells is an absolute highlight of this game. Controls are responsive and intuitive. Boss fights can be thrilling.   The voice acting in the game is definitely above average, if not very good. The main story quest (from what I got through) seems interesting. And the game definitely looks pretty, albeit more on the cartoony side than the likes of The Witcher or Skyrim (although that's not necessarily a bad thing.) Overall, what I read initially is not untrue; this is a decent RPG, good game mechanics, and looks pretty good.  Unfortunately, that's where the positives end and the disappointments begin.  Most glaring is, lest you be fooled, Kingdoms of Amalur IS NOT AN OPEN WORLD ENVIRONMENT. It is a series of corridors arranged in such a way as to give the illusion of one. Resource placement within this corridored environment is lazy, with resource generating plants conveniently located periodically along the periphery of said corridors. The side quests are similarly lazy and primarily consist of fetch quests (go and kill these guys, bring me back my ring. Collect a bunch of ingredients for potions to save the town, bring them back to me.)  Also, if KoA came any closer to straight ripping off elements of Skyrim and the Elder Scrolls series of games, I think we would have had a lawsuit on our hands. Equivalents of the Fighter's Guild, Mage's Guild, and Theives Guild? Check, check, and check, Strikingly similar lockpicking mechanism/mini-game? Oh, you betcha. Alchemy, Blacksmithing, and Enchanting requiring specific workstations of each? Bingo. Hidden traps represented BY BEAR TRAPS, actuated spike tiles, and trip wires which set off various nasties. Yup. (I mean, the bear traps might have been the last straw for me).  KoA also suffers from trying to cram way too much weapon and item variety into the game than is necessary. The result is the player being positively overwhelmed by the sheer volume of useless crap you pick up during play. Luckily, it provides a convenient and free fast travel mechanism to travel back to nearest towns to unload your useless junk. Oh, and that reminds me, all the towns I visited were essentially carbon copies of each other, with the various crafting stations, a pub, and a couple of random houses in each.  While KoA definitely has it's high points -- with combat being at the absolute top -- it relies too heavily on overused RPG tropes coupled with a very heavy 'borrowing' of mechanics and game elements from other titles. It suffers from the developers trying to cram WAY too much content, instead of focusing on providing a smaller, truer open world environment, innovative mechanics and quests, and overall immersive experience. In the end, as pretty as the game can look at times, what the game is lacking is originality. The leads to most quests and the search for crafting materials to feel more like chores, than fun. At only 8 hours into the game, I found myself overwhelmingly bored. And it's a shame.  (IF YOU DID NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)",0
"Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is something of a mixed bag. The combat system is fluid and fun, and Amalur itself can be gorgeous looking (with a little post-processing such as SweetFX). Unfortunately, the story, characters, and crafting mechanic is somewhat generic. I found myself losing steam two thirds of the way through the main quest. I am glad I finished the game, but I don’t see any compelling reason to return to finish the side quests.",0
"This is a really tough one. I so want to love this game. It's huge, with ton's of quests, tons of loot, tons of places to explore, looks good, sounds good... but it just feels so average and generic.  The outdoor areas look very much alike with just varying amounts of grass and trees, the exceptions are few. The caves, tombs and dungeons get old very quickly. Even though you get a fast travel system I have often felt like I wanted a horse. The side quests are simple and mostly boring. The world doesn't react to you at all, you don't ever change it or affect it, which is really sad for a single-player game, it often feels like an MMORPG in this regard.  I kinda hoped for a Gothic game with a better combat and maybe in raw technical sense I got one, but it never managed to grab me and make me want to play it and I've given it an ample amount of chances. It just completely failed to make me 'care' about anything at all. The world, the story, the people, my own character... I don't know why. I really want to like it, it's not exactly lacking anything major that I'd want from it, but what it delivers just doesn't feel exciting and/or fun.",0
"Average - with both good and poor features, showing a lack of cohesion in design. Incredibly simple Combat, Horrendous choices that do nothing in the profession system, superb voice acting completly at odds with the character appearances, laughable npc animations and a maguffin story that can be said in 4 words. This game 'boasts' 200 hours of gameplay but doing any % of sidequests means you'll one shot most enimies on the hardest difficulty. The Main Quest is about 15-20 hours. I think considering the amount of enemy types (9) it's still strecthing it a bit long. The redeeming features are phenominal music, lovely backdrops and varied sidequests. If you like Tolkien-esque fantasy in a Fable clone, pick it up - if it's on sale.",0
"Kingdoms of Amalur is essentially an MMO without the multiplayer. Leaving you stuck with lackluster NPCs, fetch/kill quests, and a world that just seems... empty. The upside? Incredible combat, additionally marred by a camera that doesn't really know what it wants to do.",0
"I've tried several times to get into this game but it just isn't happening.  Pros: Looks gorgeous. Runs smoothly at (or close to) 60 FPS. Colorful, imaginative designs. You can reroll your character on the fly and try out multiple builds on one character. Combat is simple, but not awful. Reminds me of a combination of the good parts of Fable and an Elder Scrolls game. Lots of side quests and dialog options (if you want that). Fast travel AND a decent run speed make exploring not a chore.  Cons: Story is incredibly bland. Yet another 'chosen one with no memories please save the world' snooze-fest. Every quest is a fetch quest or a 'go here and activate 4 different towers and come back, thanks' deal. Random battles, as in enemies will just appear out of nowhere and attack you. That last one would be bad, but there are a lot of enemies that can fly and cast magic, so they spend most of the time hovering just outside your attack range spaming magic blasts. The menus are a slog to get through. Lore books everywhere filled with really boring, needless notes. Some of the worst fantasy names this side of Dungeon Siege 3.  If you can grab the complete edition for ~$5 and you really, really want to play another Elder Scrolls inspired game it's not a bad deal, but be warned that it is aggressivly dull underneath the pretty paintjob.",0
"TL;DR: It's an alright game if you're just looking for something to scratch a third-person action itch for twenty hours or so, but there's really nothing that makes it stand out as anything special.  Combat itself is entertaining enough, but there's absolutely no depth to it - you have one basic attack per weapon type that can be chained together to a limited extent, and a couple of active abilities that scale so terribly you'll hardly bother using them. And since unlocking additional weapon moves is locked in to progress down the ability trees, you spend half the game without access to the more varied attacks, meaning that most of the time you'll just be hitting your attack button and blocking/dodging occasionally.  The combat balance is almost non-existent, enemies are almost universally completely trivial other than the occasional one who is an annoying damage sponge and does hilariously disproportionate damage, and there's only about a dozen different enemies who are palette swapped and recycled throughout the course of the game. The most challenging part of the combat is dealing with the abysmal camera, which has a mind of its own and loves to zoom right in on you when you're surrounded by enemies, only stopping to clip through the scenery and get stuck under the floor occasionally.  There's a variety of non-combat skills to choose from (lockpicking, stealth, persuasion and so on) which are generally either absolutely bloody useless, or hilariously overpowered. Depending on which ones you choose you can end up completely trivialising the game without even trying, but with a little care you can max out almost all of the skills anyway which makes any sense of choice completely redundant.  The ability trees are probably the highlight of the game, there's a lot of different abilities to choose from, and thankfully you can respec your character at any time to try different things out. Depending on how you want to play, you can either go deep into one of the trees (magic, might, or finesse, which broadly correspond to the standard mage/warrior/rogue archetypes) or split your points across two or even all three trees. Putting enough points into one tree or a combination of trees unlocks 'destinies' which give you added stats and bonus abilities and can make different ability builds feel very different from each other. Ultimately, however, it's still limited by the shallow nature of the combat system, and however you build your character you'll inevitably end up spamming the same basic attacks over and over again.  The real issue is with the pacing of the game. Every single town you come across is chock full of completely forgettable NPCs who will bury you up to your eyeballs in fetch quests and kill quests which give no real rewards but make you slog all over the place anyway. Either you try and do everything out of an obsessive sense of completionism, or you get bored of that by the second or third town, rush through the main quests, and realise there's really not that much game under all that padding. There are half a dozen factions with their own sidequest chains that have a bit more structure to them, but none of them really add much to the game, and aside from some minor stat boosts it makes absolutely no difference to anything whether you do them or not.  Overall it's a thoroughly mediocre experience through and through, which never manages to be amazingly good or offensively bad. If you like third-person action RPG games it ticks pretty much all of the boxes, it does everything more or less adequately without ever really impressing, it all looks nice enough and there's a whole bunch of lore if you can be bothered to pay attention to it. Pick it up in a sale and it'll give you a good thirty hours or so of moderate entertainment, but it's a mostly unremarkable experience with next to no replay value.",0
"I wanted to love it, I really did but it's just so boring. It's not all bad though the game is very pretty and ran very well on my machine. The combat is good, there's better combat out there it's not compelling enough to be entertaining more than a few hours. This is where the bad starts to come in. The plot was very bland and unremarkable for such a well crafted world they should have had a much more compelling plot but they didn't manage to make me care in 7 or so hours and at that point I am never going to care. The never ending fetch quests got boring very quickly, it helps move you along to new locations but it all starts to feel stale after awhile. I feel like there is some promise here and maybe when the franchise is sold to another company they can pare away all of the unnecessary nonsense, but for now there are better rpg experiences out there that you should consider way before this one. Overall I would not recommend this.  Rating: 2/5 Stars",0
"Essentially a single-player RPG with the contents of a MMO-rpg (expect the social aspect)  Some of the games artwork can at times be appealing, but personally I prefer a somewhat more toned down and realistic style. In this game, the characters have overly sized hands and weapons etc all showered with all the brightest colours the designers could think of.  The game consist of a few faction quest lines, which at times can be interesting, but all too often quest are 'go to certain point, fetch/kill, and return). Real choicemaking is non-existent.  The main story line is bland and generic, even with the '10 000 years' of background history the develpoers brag about. Magic elves, technical dwarfes, in-between humans... . The lack of good voiceacting only contributes to the game's inability to immerse, with probably as few as 10 voice-actors trying to the best of their ability to voice all characters in the game.  The combat-system is quite nice. Quite easy, but a lot of ways for the player to adapt underway to the way they want to play. And unlike more classic RPGs all character developments can be changed for a small fee, so that the player don't have to think ahead. Nice, for some... . Almost all ingame quest-rewards and looting is scaled it seems, so the player seldom experience any sense of joy or positive surprise when overcoming obstacles. Many enemies are scaled too it seems.  Personally I had to stop playing this game after encountering a game-breaking bug (Her righteous fury-quest), of which there is no official fix to 4 years after release (due to the developers bankruptcy, I guess). Therefore I could not fully explore the main idea of this game - fate. I find the idea of fate troubling on a logical level, and the game as far as I played it, did only contribute to this with all its logical fallacies.  Nice enough game if you are looking for mind-numbing, button-mashing action-rpg, with little need for investment on the player's part. Stay clear (even on sale), if you are looking for immersion, challenge and a sense of accomplishment.   This game will suck the marrow out of your bones if you are a true RPG fan. 5/10",0
"Kingdoms of Amalur begins with an appealing, even charming veneer that quickly and dramatically tarnishes. At its best, it's a generic, 'safe' fantasy game more reminisicent of an MMO than a single player WRPG.  -------------------------------------------  Combat is broken down into the typical RPG trio of Warrior (Might), Rogue (Finesses), and Mage (Sorcery), or a Jack of All Trades, with the option to respec whenever you want, as often as you want. From the beginning to the end, Sorcery goes from significantly stronger to hilariously overpowered, and the classes ultimately play the same, the only difference being in what particle effects you throw at the enemy.  The game plays more like an MMO than a traditional single player RPG. You drift from zone to zone, awaiting the inevitable explosion of yellow exclamation points, and there are indeed many. Too many, as a matter of fact. While one can argue that this adds more gampeplay time, it's more padding than lengthening. There's no substance to any of them, and they all play out essentially the same. A random loot system adds another serious deficit. Fighting your way to the bottom of an ancient ruin, behind a hidden door you may find a few mushrooms and a healing potion, while looting a random household rewards you with the ancient Deathaxe of MurderLord. It's worth noting that this randomization applies to the Blacksmithing system too, in which you salvage items for parts (Which are also completely randomzied. Epic weapons are as likely to give you worthless parts as junk weapons)to craft new ones. In theory you should be able to create weapons better than what you'd find, but you'll more likely than not find trash parts, and anything you do craft will be beaten by something you find on the side of the road.  There's little to say about the system itself. It's a very simple click-based, skill-hotbar system of combat. It's not functionally bad, it's just not very interesting, and lacks any sort of depth. The game's Inventory system has to be one of the worst i've ever seen. Although there are attempts to provide organization, they are token. You are unable to sort your list-based inventory, which seems to organize itself completely at random. Items sharing the same set name may be dozens of slots away from each other. Also of note is a serious problem with many, many quest items that never lose their flagging, leaving them trapped in your inventory for the entire game. As they still take up space, this can be a serious issue. By the end of the game, over 50 of the 110 items in my inventory were quest flagged and unremoveable.   In terms of art and sound direction, again they hit every switch to be as generic and forgettable as possible, cycling through the usual array of fantasy zones and unenergetic voice acting. The game is rife with bugs and glitches, some of which can be gamebreaking, and many of which will impact your gaming experience in other ways, such as the above mentioned Inventory issue.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- If I had to sum up Amalur in 5 words, I'd only need to give you two. 'Generic. Pass.'",0
"Lackluster. They borked their camera and prevent you from seeing a lot of the hard work they put into the visual design.   The story is freaking hoaky. Nothing interesting. The whole fate thing has been done to death by the Japanese, come on man.  The gameplay is a mixed bag, the quests suck. They're MMO quests in a single player RPG, not cool. The combat how ever is alright, though given how big the environments are they could have gone a lot more nuts with it, buy what ever. Combat gets an A.  I can't recommend this game for anything other than a quick sale buy. I really hope someone takes the ideas from it and makes something presentable.",0
"Have you ever played an MMORPG and felt, 'oh gosh, I wish there was no once else but me and the NPC's around here'? Then this game is right up your alley. This game is right down to the core an offline MMORPG. You get tons of trash armor, there's something that reminds of dungeons, kill and fetch quests everywhere and as much action in the gameplay as you would expect of an MMORPG. While the overworld have some pretty places to look at, you rarely get much of a chance to do so since you spend most of your time inside somewhere.  Positive: + Combat is responsive when dodging and there's nice hit detection when hitting an enemy + The armor is the game looks good + Overworld is pretty and there's a lot to look at + If you dig deep there's can be some fun character builds  Negative: - Using shields in combat is absolutely unresponive and awful - The amount of trash equipment you get makes it a chore to find anything. You spend more time going through trash than you do comparing which weapon to use - Questing is VERY overwhelming in this game. You get quest, on quest, on quest, on quest. - Questing is completely uninspired. If you've ever played an MMORPG you probably have experience with the kinds of quest you get in this game. - They don't put much effort into getting you interested in the story, which is needed in this game since you get so many story side-quests. Sometimes you end up doing a quest and out nowhere find out it was apparently a huge part to the main story, but unless you're really reading and listening to every single NPC on the way you won't get anything from it. - I played over 10 hours and not a single hint of a mount of any kind. Wouldn't even be a little surprised if at least 5 hours of my gameplay time has been just running from dungeon to dungeon and city to city just to get filled with quests. Some cities only exists to give you quests. - Overworld, while pretty, feels very empty. You get the feeling of playing a dead MMORPG everywhere and it just stops the world from feeling alive at all.  With all of this said, you might find some enjoyment if you really enjoy making original character builds and mess around with that. But if you're anything like me and just enjoy some classic warrior action this game is going to bore you to tears and you're better off with Guild Wars 2, which actually is an MMORPG with an alive world and have fluid combat as well.  Only buy this game if you're starving for some wRPG action.",0
"It's a good game. Anyways you will be killing the same damned monsters from the beginning of the game to the end of the game, it's absolutely ridicoulous, there are like 6/7 types of monsters so let's repeat the killing again and again and again.  The good part is the character evolution. You can upgrade your champion in many different ways...  A good game for 6$ but it would have a lot of potential with other monster types",0
"Try this game if you really like action RPGs, but if you're looking for a good, solid sandbox adventure, keep on walking.  The game world is huge, and I mean HUGE, but a ton of it is padding, and with the limited mobility options you're given, it gets really really tedious carting your sorry carcass all over creation to get things done. After a certain point it becomes a series of well-choreographed and engaging battles held together by drudgery and vast amounts of running, and that's even with fast travel as a possibility.  This game was originally envisioned as an MMO, and it really shows. You can't jump on your own, you can't really wander off the beaten path (largely because every path is so thoroughly beaten already) and without a horse or some form of mount you're left to running or sprinting. Calling this game a 'wide-open adventure' is kind of like calling a hike through redwoods with the inability to look up a 'wide-open adventure;' all of the things are there, but you can't really utilize them to their fullest capacity.  At the end of the day, KOA:R feels exactly like what it is: a U-turn into marketability.",0
"A decent game, but everything gets repetitive and bland after a while. All the quest mostly meet npc, long run to dungeon, kill kill kill, long run back, get crappy reward. Even with the fast travel its still a lot of running to be done.  World map view is separated to two different view, one overall view and one more detail view. You have to go to the overall view to fast travel, which is really annoying since you need to swap between those two and the overall view is pretty much useless.  This game would be a great for multiplay/online coop game with their huge world, running alone in the bloody huge world is really tiring.  In summary, loads of content, but most of it are the same. Rather then making the world huge they should've concretrate on the quality of the content.",0
"Fun and dynamic combat-system with cringeworthy writing and uninviting corridoor maps tacked on in an attempt to create an RPG. The combat alone was engaging enough to play past the point where I started to hate the writing and claustrophobia was creeping in, but in the end I gave up hope that things would change and skill and gear progression made the fights too easy. A real let-down, this game, but I give it points for effort in the combat department. [4/10]",0
"Alright, well, here we go, I bought this game under the impression it was open world, and had RPG elements, which it did have on both accounts, HOWEVER, After playing for 20 hours I came to a realization, this game is monotonous, it feels like ive been doing the same side quest 50 TIMES, the main story itself was intriguing, and combat is fairly fluid and dynamic, the class system in this game is different to say the least. To summarize, I came away from this game the same way I came away from Skyrim, its alot of fun, until you do everything, the choices you make have no real consequence, and the world seems HUGE on the map, but the reality is, its just large open (or semi-closed) spaces with the same brands of monsters scattered throughout the world at large, there is a backstory, but your so caught up in everything, you dont see it, I recomend this game when its onsale (for like 10$) but otherwise 7/10",0
"The game is actually pretty great and I would love to recommend it but it also managed to provide me with some of the most frustrating gaming experiences I've ever had, enough for me to just uninstall it after 30 hours of play time. There are several bugs in the game that there are no fixes for and which get you stuck, permanently. So if you didn't make a separate save (not auto-save) then you basically have to start over. The first time it happened I had a save from like 10 hours previous, very frustrating but I kept playing. Then it happened again on another quest. It just blows my mind that the developers don't even acknowledge it, let alone try to issue a patch for it.",0
"Lots of options for fighting and item crafting, but the world is way too generic and cookie cutter. Quests are boring and lack excitement. Proceed with caution.",0
"For 20 hours, I wanted to like this and tried as well. Eventually it became too hard to do so. The world is interesting, but there is too much lore and not enough drama and characterization. The choice of graphical style was very poor and is a complete mismatch to the fairly serious tone. Combat system, skill trees and many other things work well enough, but all collapses in face of the difficulty, or lack of it. It is simply impossible to fail in Amalur, and extremely hard to fall in combat. Crafting is so overpowered that loot becomes inessential and it is easy to kill everything with single clicks. Amalur is not moddable either. There is a difficulty mod, but it actually requires CheatEngine to use!",0
"I really wish Steam had a 'maybe' recommendation, because this game fits into that. I usually give RPGs about 10 hours to get me hooked, and I gave this one 20 because I heard the story was great and compelling but the story didn't go anywhere during the 20 hours I played. If I hear 'you have to put 40 in to like it' then I say go play an MMO if you're into that.  Overall, the combat is fun. I really liked it, but that might be because you never actually get to use it. You get some new gear and upgrade a few skill points and you're 1-hitting anything your level. Bosses are challenging, until you go into the superpower mode and kill each and every one. Quests aren't very compelling and the talking goes on forever without much reason for me to care about anybody. Not only that but one of the DLC's storylines about giants, which I was interested in, had a glitch that prevented me from finishing it without restarting completely. Awesome.  The graphics are cool and you know what, I wish this game had multiplayer. If it had 2 or even 4 player co-op, it would be awesome. I would have so much fun playing with other people, but the lack of enemies to kill, lack of cares I give, and lack of anything interesting in almost a day playing makes it where I don't feel happy recommending this game.",0
"It's not bad, but the constant running back and forth to quest hubs feels like a single player MMO from the early WoW clones days (Runes of Magic, etc), especially with these graphics.  Entertaining at first, but gets old fast. Love the character progression, but not enough to keep playing.",0
"I was really looking forward to this game, but in retrospect I probably shouldn't have bothered playing it. This game wastes your time with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sidequests at any given opportunity (and a boring main quest). However, the scenery is very nice in places and they did at least TRY to make interesting combat, but it becomes very repetitive after the first quarter.  It's definitely not the worst game I've played, and I can understand people enjoying it as a mindless time-killer, but I cannot recommend it.",0
"I spent hours playing this game, hoping at some point that it would get better. Sadly it did not.  The action in the game is quite good, one as to be on their toes when fighting multiple monters/enemies. But sadly it gets repetitive.  The monsters that you encounter in beginning will be the same ones that you encounter at the very end. All they do is call them different things. Example: 'Weak boggart in the beginning versus Strong Boggart' in the end.   The characters are forgettable, some of them really even have no business being in the plot.   The quests are fun at first but then they just devolve into 'go here, kill 5 wolves, come back'   The plot is interesting and seemingly original at first but by half way into the story it just turns into total garbage. The main antagonist isn't even that interesting. His dialogue is terrible, one dimensional, and repetitive. The voice acting of him is done by what sounds like a sick old man.  And everyone talks to you as if you have NO POWER at all, despite the constant acts you carry out that continually prove that you have god like powers.  I literally killed a demon the size of a 6 story building in one part of the story, only for the antagonist to talk to me afterwards as if I was some weak puppy that had the strength of an ant. Even one of your friends in the story acts like she could beat you down any time she wants, even though you constantly kick 500 times more butt than she ever could.  The endgame is no fun, not even a challenge. Once you get past a certain level and can make your own gear, you pretty much sleep walk through the late stages of the game.  I did my first playthrough of this game on HARD and I killed the final boss in 4 hits... yes you read that right, 4 hits. The difficulty on this game is a total joke.  I would only recommend this game for kids, if you are a seasoned RPG or action game players, this will be a serious let down.",0
"This isn't a bad game, its just not worth your time.  The best way to describe it is like an awsome MMO from the mid 2000's with nobody on the servers.  The main story is good, but there are SO MANY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t fetch quests that just eat up time and you have to do some of them to be an appropriate level to beat the game. There almost all terrible.  The ONLY way I could reccomend this game is if you are an unemployed gamer (no judgment) and want a large amount of time for you buck and don't mind sacrificing gameplay.  If you have a good internet connection I reccomend any good MMO over this game. It will scratch the same itch but better.",0
the most MMO-like single player ever. Grindy and with an irritating known but unpatched but that means you stop getting correctly levelled loot far enough into the game to make restarting painful.,0

"The camera is the most frustrating aspect I've ever had to deal with. Anytime I move, it pans to the ground, and won't move up, or suddenly it will move straight up. I tried, inverting it, lowering the sensitivity, nothing works.",0
"Although I've played through pretty well the whole game (minus a little bit of DLC) I can't recommend this game.   While others say that all the side quests are great and add value to the game, all they were for me was make busy time to make the game feel long. For example, towards the middle/end of the game there is a gnome city where to get the side quest you go to the very back corner of a house and then to finish the fetch quest you have to go the very back of another house and then of course go back to the quest giver to finish the quest. There doesn't appear to be any sort of design choice for that other than making the quest take longer. The amount of side quests also showed just how forgetable the main story quest was. I don't recall much if any of the main quest because there would sometimes be hours and hours between times you did something related to the main story quest.  As 'big' as this game is. It feels empty. Almost every area you go to is super similar. You go to a new area, there will be one town or a larger city to get quests from, then there is a bunch of caves/tombs/ruins to fulfil those quests. A lot of those caves/tombs/ruins all feel the same because you do the same thing in each. You enter the side quest area at one end, go to the end of the area, finish your quest and then a new path opens up to send you back to the beginning. As well each of these areas feel like copies of each other with different colour pallets. Half of these areas could have been removed and more time/focus spent on bigger and better side quests that actually felt rewarding.  As well there is a serious problem with enemies in this game, as in, there is not near enough of them. There appears to be a set of them and then a bunch of recolours or with a different weapon or something. There was hardly an variety in the enemies making each area again feel like copies of previous areas.  The one positive I'm going to give this game is the amount of lore they've packed into it. If you complete all the side quests/faction quests and main quest you will have a lore overload and if thas your thing this game has it.",0
"Only spent an hour playing this game because I encountered a game-breaking bug. About an hour in, you fight the first 'boss', the rock troll. After defeating the troll, you are prompted to press F. I spent almost half an hour spamming F in every area around the troll. I tried restarting the game. Tried restarting my computer. I tried using a controller. I tried killing the troll in the center of the room, per suggestions online. Nothing. I am unable to progress because I'm unable to finish this sequence.   Almost 5 years later and this game-breaking bug isn't fixed. Oh well, I guess it was only $5.",0
"Boring game. Little weapon variety, what weapons there are all have the same attacks, just press one attack button. Same monsters throughout the entire game, they just give them different names. Main quest line is very boring and repetitive. Go into this castle and fight horde after horde of people to kill this boss, all while just pressing one button to attack *yawn*. Feels like an MMO but it is single player so the whole world feels very empty and lonely and not fun to explore. If you go the rogue class good luck getting any gear. 14 hours of gameplay and i still had the starting gear they gave me in the tutorial because everything else was for casters or warriors. Dont waste your money, even if its on sale",0
"Story drags from one repetative quest to another. The real time combat system and gear system is wierd. For instance a stealther with a shield? Even a decent way into the game I find myself spamming the same attack combo over and over.  EA also gives you buffed gear in the beginning, one set is themed after Sheapard from Mass Effect. IT is seriously overpowered, and will make you for a good part of the beginning of the game wonder why the game drops gear at all.  I really want to like this game have tried it several times to try to get into it, but just cannot. It has great graphics and the main story is interesting, that is about where it ends.  Lastly can we say EA account... why even allow the game on Steam if I have to have an EA Origin account to play?",0
"Amalur would have been a great...well, at least good, 20-30 hour game. Unfortunately it goes on far, far, far longer than it should have The mechanics are already well worn by hour 15 and did little to change over the next 40. This wouldn't be too bad if the game wasn't excessively repetitive, even by RPG standards. You spend the bulk of this time mashing buttons to kill groups of 4-8 enemies over and over - never with any sense of real power or progression due to enemies leveling with you. Quests become a homogenous blur of cave delving and monster killing and about 2/3 of the way through the game I began to resent it and just rushed through to see the ending. I wish I had made the decision to do that even sooner.  It's a shame because it seems like the world has actually has a reasonably novel backstory. It relies on typical fantasy tropes, but not quite to the extent of other RPGs. The story also opens an interesting manner; however, even this falls short of it's potential, with a stodgy presentation that lacks personality and the game's overabundance of sidequests, fights, and travel diluting whatever motivating force the story could impart. At some point you stop caring and stop listening and characters are just a means to check off quest objectives.",0

Can not get this game to run. Forums are no help. Want a refund. No game should take this much of my time to fix.,0
"After everal hundred hours of play, the movements of the character stalls, hesitates and locks up. I have removed this game and reloaded it without any improvement. I have reloaded flash player and shockave, no help. The other steam games I use still work properly, therefor the problelm seems to be intigral to this probram. HELP??",0
"The combat is okay, but magic is straight up better than the rest of the trees (which are broken up by your standard warrior/thief/wizard) and while there is a 'lot of content' most of the side missions are repetative and boring. The people who give those quests are almost real people, but I feel like while there was all this time put into the world could have gone into more of the gameplay itself.  I can not recomend this for the current $20 price tag, and I wouldn't recomend it at a lower price tag. I would say there are probably better options out there, especially if you don't want to use a controller or are not a fan of bad camera.",0
"Sandbox games fail when they are simply padded with tedious, meaningless side quests whose only purpose is to string out your gameplay time. Enter Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, which embodies the worst of this.   The principle concept of the main story is actually pretty interesting. Everyone is tied to fate except you. So you have the potential to change the course of history. Its a pretty good excuse for a chosen one scenario. This ties into a card mechanic that shows up when you level and accomplish certain milestones. It also gives a good excuse for how you can re-shuffle your stats. Then everything goes downhill.   There's still bugs, particularly when you try to remap your keys and a few crash to desktops, but that isn't the games greatest sin. Neither is the hideous menu system (which in turn makes crafting annoying at best). The worst part? In short, the game just becomes so boring. It became boring surprisingly early. It is a chore just to want to finish it. This is a direct result of the heavy investment in sidequests and how travel works. I've spent the majority of my 40+ hours just running from place to place for quests. Running from place to place is boring. Running in a linear dungeon with the same tedious fights that are always resolved in the same manner because of a lack of needed for any real tactics and a surprising lack in variety of gameplay is also very boring.   That word best summarizes Kingdoms of Amalur: Boring.",0
"Well, this one is quite a hard one for me.   For starters, it was a blast, like discovering a jewel that has been sitting in front of you all of the time without you noticing it. I was like, 'Why didn't I know this game did exist at all?' And so I was really hooked to it for a couple of hours. A couple of dozens of hours.   A really pretty game. Big and stable (at least for me). WIth a funny and fluent combat system (I would dare to say in the likes of Dark Souls, Darksiders or Blade: Edge of Darkness (things tend to get dark when combat systems are cool, it seems)). With a slightly original setting from your usual fantasy RPG and inmersive too. Decent crafting, voice acting and music...  But then it started to feel a bit shallow. As if you were playing an MMOPRG, but without the social interaction. Quests started to feel repetitive, the NPCs less charming, the story not that interesting. Everything was a bit of a chore.   Worst of all, I felt no challenge at all. Even when the combat felt right and was funny, this has to be the ONE game for me in which I NEVER died. Not once. In the whole of the game. Not a single failed combat situation, and let me tell you it is a long way to complete it. I know there are roundabouts for this (both patches and even set paths to keep you a wimp for the whole of the main story around the web), but this is clearly not right.  So, at the end, I wouldn't recommend it. It gave me plenty of hours of enjoyemet a the star, but left me empty and a bit angry by the mid-end game. If you can get it on sale (not very often, I think) go for it, but else, I wouldn't do so.  Cheers,",0
"Game is fun but has too many issues and too many filler content. If you really want it, rush it on casual and buy it when it is on sale.",0
"-Did not keep my attention for long -World feels enclosed/empty and superficial (like playing in a giant bowl) -Combat-oriented; inappropriate/out of place hack-n-slash combat system for an RPG  -Felt reminiscent to a mediocre MMORPG without all the players (shallow quests, for instance)  +appealing visuals and aesthetics  +despite combat system feeling out of place, it is rather satisfying +skill trees presented cool abilities and freedom of playstyle; you do not have to spend points on a single tree to benefit  Final Verdict: I want my $5 back.",0
"At first the game seemed to be fun. It was fun trying out different builds, character looks, weapons and magic. The quests were fun as well, in the beginning that is. But the fun pretty much stopped when I realised that the quest are all the same 'we have a problem, please do that and that' - so tedious and unimaginitive and boring. I mean the quest in Skyrim are so much better and IMMERSIVE. So combat system becomes a drag and a total bore after you get to Ysa (that how it was for me) and the difficulty is disheartening. I played on hard, yet it was a stroll. Boring. Don't mean to spoil the ending, but it was so ******* stupid and dull. The whole game feels so scripted you can't feel yourself immersed in the world of Amalur.  3/10",0
"I encountered just few minor bugs in this game, but what was more annyoing, was camera. Very weird, I just couldnt get used to it and didnt find any means how to change it. Moreover, this game is quite similar to Bethesdas Elder scrolls series, so why to bother playing Amalur, if Daggerfall, Morrowind and so on are just amazing enough.",0
"This game is overly long with way too many areas and quests for such a non-epic storyline. The art style just didn't seem to mesh with a narrative written by R. A. Salvatore. Combat was repetitive and boring as well with boss fights that weren't memorable...seriously, I can't describe a single boss sequence from this game, and I played it from start to finish and completed all quests in each area (I really shouldn't have wasted my time on that). Yeah, this game does a great job to suck you in, but it's about as addictive as World of Warcraft but without the payoff.",0
"It's not that it's outright bad, but I just don't like it. Every time I tried to give this game another shot, something held me back. Whether it was the plain jane beat 'em up combat, or the odd camera angles (which make it harder to appreciate the beautiful environment of the game) there's just something that stopped me from enjoying this game.",0
"This game most definatley has its merits, but in the end it feels like a cheap singleplayer MMO. The combat system is unique and spectacular, and the world is most definatley large, but a lot of the times, it feels empty and lifeless. Most of the quests are generic go here, gather that quests and that's fine if you are into that kind of thing, but it gets old quickly. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™ means well, but it loses momentum fast.",0
"Game with no aesthetic quality, and bland combat. Meh overall.",0
"If you're looking for a game that constantly makes you think, 'hey, this would be cool, if...' then this is the game for you. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a game that would have been great, if they had only done a little more/better... of, well, everything. Am not trying to imply that It is a bad game, just disappointing, since with a little more effort and time, it could have been something worthwhile. However, it is what it is, which is an mediocre action adventure game with semi open world rpg elements that is only worth it if you can get it on sale and have a lot of free time.",0
"I wouldn’t buy this game for 40 euro, because the gameplay not worth that much. It's worth your money if you buy it between 5-10 euro.   +++ Some areas are very beatiful drawn  - - Some areas drawn rush trough  +- The MAIN story is reasonable  +- The FACTIONS story’s are reasonable  - The OTHER story's are very boring - Boring conversations  - Bad graphics (cartoony like WoW) - Very bad music  - Quest log is bugged; you can’t read the questlog - The game has very simple mechanics (childish) just rush trough. Good for noobs.  - The combatsystem is very easy in Normal mode. Good for starters boring for hardcore players.  - The game feels childish not like Skyrim or Dark Souls   Overall score: 72%",0
"Loot system isn't great. Lacks environment diversity, and many mechanics present in other examples of this genre, such as locking on enemies, which is very annoying. The game becomes boring very fast.",0
Simple and boring. Only fun the first playtrough. 5/10,0
its sad to say that i had this working fine back in the day in a hacked version.... now i actually go and be a good kid and pay for it... doesnt work... lost cause. 3 days 5 different installs and every combination of forum suggestions... lost cause.. will not launch past black screen where i have to force close ,0
"Nothing about this game drew me into it, the plot was meh, the gameplay was alright and the storytelling was just fine. I went into it expecting something like Fable and was greatly dissapointed. 5/10",0
"This game itself seem'ed interesting enough. I've got it during the sale, it was a 'great' deal...At first.  See, I haven't got far into the game, and have hit a glitch / bug that apparent, is very common. This bug, is that your character would move for about 3 seconds, than stuck in the same spot indefinitely, until another action is performed. This isn't lag, the game world around you runs just fine. ( The solution to this bug, is to reload a save file before this bug occured. ) But this bug happened to me just very shortly after I've started the tutorial...  According to Google, and several websites. This game's developer studio crashed and burned shortly after this game's release, so there will be no post-release patches or updates to fix any bugs or glitched that could / may occur in the game.  The game concept itself seems interesting enough, where you could build your own character, and play any style you want. But as I've stated above, this glitch threw me off way too much. I've lost complete interest after about 30 minutes of game time.  If you think you've got pretty good luck, and insists on trying this game out. Go for it, for its sale price, it's pretty decent. It's just a pity that this game breaking bug will never be fixed. Really seem'ed like a fun game.",0
A pretty boring Quest Fest.,0
"Very basic game. Simple hack'n slash. Graphics reasonable, limited amount of enemies. Story is extremely generic, bland and forgettable, same as all characters. World is empty, lore is boring/non-existant. Skills are mediocre. Just about all quests are fetch, go and kill, with a lot of walking/backtracking. Even instant travel to found locations doesn't make life that much better. Some minor bugs, DLC is nothing special. Really not worth it at all.",0
"if you like games with combat based entirely on stunlocks, kingdoms of amalur is for you",0
"This game is almost good. I really wanted to enjoy it, but it's ruined by the fact that it's WAY too easy. Even on the hardest difficulty, there is no real point in doing... anything. You can do perfectly well with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ character and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons. A main point of a game like this should be progression and developing your character, but there's no point in doing so because you can stomp pretty much anything in the game with ease.",0
"I have to say, I really wanted to like this game. I was under the impression that Reckoning was a 'sleeper' of sorts, even though I'm not a big fan of stylized graphics. While I started out feeling somewhat good about the game, it didn't take long to notice the lack of palpable, gut-sticking depth. When it came time to sit down and pick my poison for the night I had no desire to play this game.  Pros: Fun combat controls, excellent environs, plenty to do, quite a number of crafting options, solid animations, mostly polished, mix-matching of the 3 class types (warrior, rogue, wizard).  Cons: The stories/adventures/crafting lack a special something (heart?), no jumping/climbing, beautiful areas are often just for 'looks' and cannot be explored, small areas where the game just wasn't fleshed out (like reading books, managing inventory, and skill trees).  If you're looking for a light romp though a fantasy world and you're less concerned about depth and more interested in a relatively fun combat system and plenty of run-around, this is likely a good enough choice for you. If you're on the other side of the fence and you prefer options, a little more freedom, and a world to sink your teeth into you'll not find it here.",0
At first it was fun to slash and burn..but the story isn't captivating so I stopped the game at 12 hours...,0
"So close, so very close. This game was almost good. It had a lot of good ideas, but did not follow through with any of them. Everything in the game feels just short of being good. It is probably a case of trying to do too much. Rather than do a few things very well, this game tries to give you everything, and none of it quite makes the cut. The plot takes some interesting ideas, but does not develop them very well. The setting starts of interesting looking, but is not fully realised. The combat system could have been the best, but the mechanics just do not quite work properly. The Quests try to do something a little different, but they still manage to feel stale very quickly. This was almost a really good RPG, but instead it feels thoroughly disappointing.",0
"woke up in a pile of dead bodies, could not sleep with any of them 8/10 game f**king sucks ~ign",0
Didnt like it: Played through the tutorial &amp; was bored. Combat systems are boring from what I've seen. Felt like the bad parts of an MMO right off the bat.,0
"I tried to like this game. A HUGE open world with endless amount of things to do. Unfortunately, too much running around and somehow a way too boring. I installed hardcoremod (which made game much better), but unfortunately even that couldn't help me to overcome the strong feeling of boredom. Fighting is dull (and too easy), discussions and characters are boring, the world is beatiful but still nothing new. This game just has no soul. Better luck next time.",0
"The graphics are kind of cartoony which makes them look out of date. The quests get repetitive really fast (kill this, fetch that). The skill trees are OK, but they have been done in similar ways sooo many times. The cutscenes are poor because the characters just stand there. And sometimes background sounds interfere with the cutscenes - e.g. a wounded woman was moaning like she was in a porno so loud at the first cutscene that I was barely able to hear what was being said. I mean come on, if you can't patch such simple things, then forget it. It really does not help with the story that is bland anyway. To sum up - as many reviewers here mentioned before, this game is just so mediocre and uninspiring in every way. It's like a boring offline MMO. Nothing stands out, everything has been done before here or there and many times in a better way. I really tried to like this game but I just got so bored so fast.",0
Lackluster and boring,0
go buy fable instead.,0
This game could be really good &amp; fun to play but unfortunate there is so many bugs in this game that it's simply not possible to complete all missions in the game (without getting hugs bugs there affects your game)  110 hours have i now played and restarted about 10 times! and this is serious too much for me so i cannot recommend this game at all.,0

"Originally developed as an MMORPG, Kingdoms of Amalur is sort of like playing a great online game on your own little private server.   The advantage of this is that you don't have to play the game with any MMORPG weirdos. So if RPGs are your go-to for immersion, nobody's going to mess with your little fantasy here.  The disadvantage is that, weird as other players can be, it's actually very depressing playing a game like this on your own, and it can feel a lot like you're marooned in some sort of MMORPG-version solipsistic nightmare with all NPC eyes on you. This is the sad secret behind every single player game, but developers usually go to great lengths to hide it.   In this game you will feel alone because in playing it, you are alone. You will travel and discover (frequently beautiful) new lands, defeat big monsters, talk to boring NPCs, and collect silly looking gear. You will do it alone, and you will feel alone. The world is open and everything is permitted because there's nobody around to care about you or your choices. Your victories will feel as hollow as your losses because ultimately they are.  Stripped of narrative weight and consequence to accomodate the MMO format, stripped of human consequence because 38 Studios died and we needed a single player game instead, Kingdoms of Amalur is a great 'could have been' that bears the burden of both single player loneliness and MMO repetition. A theme park that everybody either left, or nobody ever made it to. Truly depressing.",0
It would be a good game if it weren't for the Main Story Bugs In the 'hunters hunted' mission (a main Quest mission) there is a bug that prevents you from proceeding with the main quest and there is nothing you can do about it  Sorry to say- don't buy unless you see some actual patching being done on this game i spent hours on this game only to find i need to restart for the CHANCE of passing this level ,0
"Spent a long time playing this game and I just keep coming back to the same issue: I almost like it. Almost.  Combat is fun, graphics work well but the story is completly unengaging. Fun combat and no story does not an RPG make. Sooner or later the shine wears off the combat and you're left with no real reason to complete the game. Shame really.",0
"Kingdoms of Amalur is what an MMO would be like without other players. Want to wander through cavernous environments rife with fetch quests? Do you enjoy immersion breaking question-marked quest givers? How about a bland story that tries very hard get you interested in 10,000 years of lore without providing an modern (within the game context) relevance? Those are the features of KOA that you'll encounter. The combat is interesting and refreshing for an action-RPG but that doesn't make a good game nor does it draw me in to the world. After 15 hours or so I found myself playing this game like Diablo, micro-managing stats and largely ignoring the talky parts. That would be fine if KOA didn't try so hard to convince you its story is worth knowing. This is a game built on the words of RA Salvatore, how it failed to tell a story is beyond me.   Pros: Frequently on sale, Combat Cons: Story, MMO-like mechanics without multiplayer, Abuse of the word RPG, Fetch Quests, Throw-away mobs.  ",0
"this is a game that i withstood against buying for some time yet i wanted to give it a try cus I heard that one of my favourite author ''RA Salvatore'' took place in the game and here what i think: + ; cool, action-packed gameplay nice graphs open world, yet this may become problematic after a point... variety in monsters. - ; uninteresting story, plot no matter how hard you try, things are so dissatisfying. shallow after sometime you get bored. i dont find the game very addictive repetitive crafting system... 6/10 ",0
"I didn't like it. Basically, you can't jump and there are no objects in the game world, just containers; it's that sort of game. Don't get me wrong, the textures, lighting, character design, voices, buildings, weapons and world are OK, maybe 10 years ago I'd be really impressed with this game. However it just doesn't cut it after Skyrim, it's not even better then Oblivion or Gothic 2. To me, it's just not 'open world' unless you can jump and look around the back of the cave for a few elusive coins.  Shame, because it looks like a nice world and it's obviously had a lot of thought put into it but the gameplay too generic, paint by numbers and boring. This is to RPG what Zelda is to AD&amp;D",0
"The combat is fun. Unfortunately: The world does not feel open enough for an open-world RPG, and the NPCs are not interesting enough for a story-directed RPG. I normally do all the side-quests in an RPG, and in this game there are just so many that they burnt me out. The overarching story is embarrassingly generic. About a third into the game, loot drops become useless; crafting, on the other hand, is overpowered. Feels too much like it was over-simplified for consoles. No support or updates to fix issues.",0
"Imagine you're playing a generic MMORPG, except it is offline.",0
The following is just my own opinion.  I really like the art style and the colorful world. Reminds me of Fable.  I really hate the control and the lack of deep game mechanics.  I would say buy it when it is dirt cheap. Otherwise don't bother.,0
"There are positivies but i really dont recommend this game if you hate doing side quests : Killing spiders, finding eggs and plants across the map etc. They are so boring and breaking the main point of the game so bad.",0
"Lots of potential, and some of it is fun. The biggest issue I have with this game is the same thing that ruined dragon age inquisition for me, way to much fluff. There are things in the game designed to waste your time and make the game longer for the sake of it being longer and not designed to add to the game.",0
"Purchased this game after reading about who was involved in its creation. Left it in my library for a while and wasn't motivated to install or play it. I finally got around to it!  Firstly, the world is huge! There are many places to explore if you're into that. Secondly, there are a lot of quests to gather. So far I have not seen any consequences to the decisions your hero makes. The story doesn't seem to be too much about the hero, but those around the hero, which, in my opinion, caused me to disassociate with my toon. I didn't feel particularly important. I mostly felt like some lackey who needed to fetch this or go slay that.  The audio of the game bothered me a bit, particularly the character speech. In a lot of instances I could barely hear the NPCs speak and had to rely on subtitles to know what's going on. I looked for an adjustment that catered to headphones (if that was the problem) but found no such option in the menu. I understand that the sounds should be directional (ie the dialogue should sound softer when camera is turned away from the NPC), but this occurs in cutscenes as well and I found it annoying that I could not hear the voice actors.  The camera action in the game is also a bit wonky. In some situations the camera just...leaves you, as if you dropped it and you watch your toon run away. The sensitivity of camera movement, if you're using a mouse to look around, is way too sensitive. A light movement from the mouse could swing the camera really fast at odd angles. That sort of thing made combat a little frustrating for me, where one second I am charging at my target and the next I'm looking at the wrong direction.  All in all, it's a beautiful game with a LOT to do and has a deep customization factor for your hero, but those little problems I noted above just takes the immersion experience away from me. To be able to be immersed into the world and its lore is why I like RPGs in the first place.",0
The evolution is too slow. It's sad because it could have made a good game. It looked promising.,0
"Enjoyed this game alot on the XBOX 360 enough to rebuy it for PC. I should have just saved my money for something else because all Ive had since installing Kingdoms of Amalur is pure grief. First it begins with music stutter, then frames begin stuttering within 30 seconds of launching the game...then it crashes my PC. I guess this is another game that doesnt like the quad core i7. I cant recommned against buying the game for Duo core users as it will probably work better for them. After trying numerous times to get this game to run, I have given up and thankfully, I only lost $4.99 instead of $20. Its too bad though, I really would had liked to experience this game on PC instead of 360",0

Well then, this is the game for you! Specifically for you and no-one else!  Everyone else - feel free to play Skyrim instead. A much better game in every possible respect.  p.s. The art-style of this game is very cool and colorful, but is almost completely destroyed by the camera, staring at the ground 90% of the time with no option to adjust it in any way.",0

"I really wanted to like this game and while I enjoyed the first quarter of it, the game quickly became lackluster. There was so much potential staring me right in the face but the lack of polish and variety ultimately made for a rather boring experience. Numerous times through the game I couldn't help but think that the producers, having probably spent a large portion of the budget to bring in McFarlane for concept art; Salvatore for story writing; and voice actors for all of the dialog, were demanding unrealistic publish dates that forced the developers into a tough position. The world wasn't immersive enough, the combat encounters were way too repetative due to painfully small monster variety, the itemization was awful... during the last quarter of the game I stopped openning chests and looting bodies completely because I never found upgrades anyway, and the level design felt unnecessarily drawn out or repetative in many ways.  Ultimately, this game shows that a lot of quality work went into conceiving a game that would have been amazing to play, deeply immersive, and with many novel concepts, but somewhere in the process of development a line was drawn and deep concessions were made. Evidence that the games' potential was never realized is staring you in the face from start to finish. It is a shame really.",0
"The core game is average but, worth playing if you get this game on sale. My biggest issues are that I feel lonely when I roam this sort of 'realistic' world and it feels like an MMO that was changed last minute to a single-player experience.

So did you complete tons of quests and work really hard on getting awesome gear? Too bad cause the next zone is scaled up to your level so it doesn't mean jack.

The disadvantage is that, weird as other players can be, it's actually very depressing playing a game like this on your own, and it can feel a lot like you're marooned in some sort of MMORPG-version solipsistic nightmare with all NPC eyes on you. This is the sad secret behind every single player game, but developers usually go to great lengths to hide it.   In this game you will feel alone because in playing it, you are alone. You will travel and discover (frequently beautiful) new lands, defeat big monsters, talk to boring NPCs, and collect silly looking gear. You will do it alone, and you will feel alone. The world is open and everything is permitted because there's nobody around to care about you or your choices. Your victories will feel as hollow as your losses because ultimately they are.  Stripped of narrative weight and consequence to accomodate the MMO format, stripped of human consequence because 38 Studios died and we needed a single player game instead, Kingdoms of Amalur is a great 'could have been' that bears the burden of both single player loneliness and MMO repetition. A theme park that everybody either left, or nobody ever made it to. Truly depressing.",0
It would be a good game if it weren't for the Main Story Bugs In the 'hunters hunted' mission (a main Quest mission) there is a bug that prevents you from proceeding with the main quest and there is nothing you can do about it  Sorry to say- don't buy unless you see some actual patching being done on this game i spent hours on this game only to find i need to restart for the CHANCE of passing this level ,0
"Spent a long time playing this game and I just keep coming back to the same issue: I almost like it. Almost.  Combat is fun, graphics work well but the story is completly unengaging. Fun combat and no story does not an RPG make. Sooner or later the shine wears off the combat and you're left with no real reason to complete the game. Shame really.",0
"Kingdoms of Amalur is what an MMO would be like without other players. Want to wander through cavernous environments rife with fetch quests? Do you enjoy immersion breaking question-marked quest givers? How about a bland story that tries very hard get you interested in 10,000 years of lore without providing an modern (within the game context) relevance? Those are the features of KOA that you'll encounter. The combat is interesting and refreshing for an action-RPG but that doesn't make a good game nor does it draw me in to the world. After 15 hours or so I found myself playing this game like Diablo, micro-managing stats and largely ignoring the talky parts. That would be fine if KOA didn't try so hard to convince you its story is worth knowing. This is a game built on the words of RA Salvatore, how it failed to tell a story is beyond me.   Pros: Frequently on sale, Combat Cons: Story, MMO-like mechanics without multiplayer, Abuse of the word RPG, Fetch Quests, Throw-away mobs.  ",0
"A sort of hybrid of Fable and Skyrim, Amalur suffers because of its unoriginality. In the end, why play it? If you are looking for a skyrim-alike game, play that instead. Miss Fables? Play the original, for it is still the best.   Competently made and largely free of graphical or gameplay glitches, Amalur suffers from the greatest sin a video game can commit: it is boring.",0
"My first reaction to the game was: Graphics weren't what I was expecting, polished combat and extremely well made. But I quickly felt like there was something missing in this game. Something uncoherently mistaking. The combat feels really arcade as do the graphics but besides that there is areally polished RPG factor in it. You might say: that would be a positive thing. But I can't help but feel it does not match well together. Atleast for me it does not. The way I see it Kingdoms of Amalur is quite a big game, not seamingless, more like zones connected to each other. But the bland quests, not really appealing story and on the other hand good looks and superb combat makes me feel like I can't land my feet and immerse in the game.",0
"Boring, slow, clunky, and obviously something it was never meant to be. This was not meant to be a single player RPG, it was meant to be an MMORPG, and not even a good one, and not even for the PC. No MMO on the PC has this poor of an interface, this strange of movement, and this bad of an economy. Crafting and gold don’t scale fast enough to match shop prices, so don’t expect to buy more than one piece of gear when you go into town. Ultimately, my biggest issue is that the areas are so narrow. Compare to all MMOs, and you will find the every zone ringed by hills, most of which cannot be scaled. The difference is that, until a zone transitions, they are far away. If you stand in the center, you will need to walk a good distance to reach the cliffs. The walk from the middle to the edge is less than the distance to my bookcase.  Boring, poorly made, and poorly adapted. Shameful waste of the 5 bucks I spent on it.",0
no jump / no auto run / messed up hot key system = fail for me  but if u dont care about those things then its a great rpg.,0
"Moderately ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with far too easy of a combat system / gameplay, a storyline that tries to be rich and complex and detailed and just ends up being uninteresting while throwing far too much information at you, and graphics that feel like the entire thing is taking place in oldschool Ashenvale in World of Warcraft. Honestly. Areas all have a tint to them, and the first major one is pretty damn purple.  I've never regretted paying full price for a game more (Save maybe Fable 3), but that's what I get for buying EA.",0
"It feels like an attempt at an action MMORPG where they ran out of time to complete the networking so they just released it anyway as a singleplayer game. The combat is mediocre at best with no depth so it gets repetitive, requiring you to spend hours levelling before you can begin to do anything slightly diverse. It feels kind of unresponsive because some animations for attacks take so long and you can't even dodge-cancel out of them. The world is really big and beautiful though but ultimately meaningless without good gameplay. The camera is also really close, so close it's almost nauseating.",0
"It starts good but after 20 minutes of gameplay, apart from the bland quests, found a box with all powerfull weapons and with that all game completely become so easy to be uninstalled.  'Kingdoms of Amalur is essentially an MMO without the multiplayer. Leaving you stuck with lackluster NPCs, fetch/kill quests, and a world that just seems... empty. The upside? Incredible combat, additionally marred by a camera that doesn't really know what it wants to do'  I completely agree!",0
"This game has one of the best action mechanics i've played, but it's just too long and it starts to get very boring and repetitive, I've played this a lot and didn't gt to end it yet",0
This game is all about grinding. The only PC video options are what resolution you want to use. It plays like a single player MMO.,0
"The only fun part of this game is being a criminal, combats great too....everythings else is just a tad boring.",0
"Invisible walls restricting movement. There's mouse acceleration. The developers do not fix problems with the game, so if there is anything completely game-breaking, you're boned.  Three strikes, and you're out. Do not buy this game.",0
"To clarify, the GAME is fun, and I would recommend it. The DLC **DO NOT BUY**. There are a lot of little bugs and glitches, and all of them can be overlooked....except for a few. Which will literally end your time playing on that character. The Dead-Kel expansion was what stopped me. After defeating him, my companion spawned dead next to him, and remained dead when escaping the tunnel where there are 2 cave-ins which the companion gets teleported imbetween before coming to a dead-end beach. The idea is, your companion will be teleported to that spot so they don't get too far behind and will follow you onto the beach where you will be teleported out after speaking with them. Sadly, if your companion is dead, and you don't have multiple save spots, your game simply ends here. If your companion is stuck but alive, there's an exploit you can do which will cause it to get 'un-stuck' and you can hopefully continue with your game.   The game is insanely easy, even on Hard difficulty. Once you get a set-piece with +1hp regen, you'll almost never need to use a potion ever again. It's just sad, that I couldn't play it through just to see the story and was cut short due to a horrible game design. The company is disbanded and won't be patching a fix for it, so I'll save you the time now, and tell you to just keep moving along and find another game. Or don't play any of the DLC's.....or....have a lot of different saves because you'll never know how far back you'll need to restart to compensate for bugs.",0
"Fable, Darksiders, Oblivion and (of course) World of Warcraft ♥♥♥♥ and produce one utterly unremarkable product. However, if you're a citizen of Rhode Island, you could probably buy this game instead of paying taxes.",0
"Every review is positive here, so im going to bring up the bad stuff about this game, and what other games does better.  Where do I start?  Your character is glued to the ground to start with. You cannot jump. The map is big, but because of the glued to the ground issue, and the way they built the enviroment, its tedious as **** to walk around in the world. Rocks, tree-roots, rivers and small valleys. Walk around and find the way down/over/around. Tedious. Also, the only way to 'jump' down a valley or such, is to find a small wooden ramp. Then you press F and the character jumps down. The height of these will blow your mind. The world itself is big. Not HUUUUGE like the other wants you to think. Its not a free world like gta or skyrim, you go where they want you to go.   Monsters/enemies. They are not very varied. Same stuff to kill over and over. (Fighting/combat is fun however so its 50/50)  Reused textures/enviroments. Makes me angry, this ♥♥♥♥ right here. The caves that exists everywhere all look alike. Small differences but still big sections are the same everywhere. Kinda ruins the feeling.  Leveling up is fine, so is the weapons dmg, types and so on.  This game has nothing that skyrim doesn't do better. Looting and taking everything in the chest, you have to use the mouse to press 'take all'. And you loot a lot, A LOT. So small irratating things like these are everywhere.  Fighting upphill? To bad, if you have ranged weapons/magic they will go straight forward, into the ground.    Story is ok. Good concept, poorly executed.  PROS: Combat feels nice and looks good, WOW style. Big enemies, bosses and such are really fun to fight.  CONS: The game is EASY. Im playin on hard right now and it feels like easy. This game has nothing on other games in the same genré.  Conclusion: Save your money.",0
"Gets boring fast. THe skill trees for different classes are intriguing, but the nature of the combat in game usually means every fight devolves into a melee regardless of your class.  For your money, you're much better off going with the Darksiders franchise.",0
"If you are expecting to use an Xbox controller with this game you are mistaken until EA or Big Huge fixes the mapping it is unplayable. You would think that this being a released on console they would have got it right on PC but as it is now it is currently unplayable with the 360 Controller. KB&amp;M work fine but this game was made for a controller, a controller that you cannot use because 1 button is mapped to 7 different actions and cannot be remapped. Makes using a 360 controller impossible. No fix on the any of the forums either..... If you want to play with KB&amp;M go for it might be a good game but if you might ever want to use a controller save your money it’s unplayable",0
Multiple incomplete gameplay mechanics does not make one complete game. Nor does a lacklustre story and overly generic setting make for an interesting adventure for that part.  Looking for a mindless way to kill a large mount of time? Welcome. Looking for something actually interesting and engaging? Look elsewhere.,0

"Well, I played this game for at least 38h now, which is not very much compared to some other ones I played. But the difference is: To play this game feels more like work than fun to me. I know, the points I'll criticize are very subjective, but that's the thing with critics, so no offense to the ones who love this game, it just doesn't seem to be my style. ;)  Story/Quests:  Ähem. First a confession: I didn't finish it. Yeah. Sorry. It was just not interesting enough. There are epic bossfights, a very, very evil overlord, a war and you as - of course - the chosen one. At least everything you need for a high-fantasy RPG. NPC's are exchangeable all over the place, I cannot even remember a single name. Much less their background.  The main Quests are okay, the 'guild'-Quests also, the rest is too often just filler (Kill X to get Y and bring it to Z), nothing memorable.  World/Graphic: It's colorful. Very colorful. So colorful that I cannot take this game as serious as it wants to be. All this quirky, comic-like fairy-stuff... I mean, even the supposed 'Dark' areas are kinda sweet!  The Graphics themselves are okay, not state of the art, but it's a game from 2012, so - oh, wait... 2012? ... Yeah, they could have done it better then. But it's still not 'bad', just 'okay'.  The map is gigantic and you are free to walk where you want. Unless you walk against a rock. Or against any other obstacle on your path. Even if it's just waist-high. And that upsets me every time in every game! But the music is lovely!   Fighting/Level System: The Action is nice, there are a lot of cool moves you can do, some really powerful spells and techniques. All combined, it makes quite fun to slay all that monsters. And if you are as bored as me by the story (but still not bored enough to quit yet), you might also regard the looting and levelling as your last source of long-term motivation. Also the game has a cool crafting-system, it's diversive and sometimes useful at the same time!  RPG really is my genre of choice, but it seems that I'm not a colorful, very-high-fantasy kind of player... I really gave it many chances to thrill me, but the atmosphere, the story, the character - all that failed to thrill me.",0
"World isn't immersive as the quests are very similar to MMO's. No challenge or effort put into them whatsoever.  Combat system is highly similar to Fable 2 and Fable 3. However, this does not matter as the actual game world feels dead. It honestly feels like I'm playing an MMO that died years ago and I'm the only player online. None of my in-game accomplishments really matter in the game world because everyone praises you no matter what you do.  You could scratch your bottom, rub your crap-stank fingers on a princesses nose and she will praise you for being the saviour of humanity. It's horse wank.   I don't know what to call this game. RPG? Open world? Sure. But it's VERY average. It does not compare to games like Dragon Age, Skyrim, Two Worlds 2 or anything of that caliber.   Buy it when it's on sale for $5. NOT worth the full price. I regret paying for it to be honest.  6/10",0
"- Found it hard to play with the current camera setup, couldnt zoom out any further(or at least find a way to do so) and this ruined the game for me. - mediocre gfx even for 2012, pretty sure my galaxy s4 can do better. - Tried to like it and pushed through to the 1st town but after receiving multiple random quests pretty much from nowhere i found that the whole feel of the game was underwhelming and a little outdated. - Unsure of all the reviews giving it awesome scores etc, as this was not the case for me. - If your looking for that game of all games, then i would suggest looking elsewhere as this is no ground breaker.",0
"Kingdoms of Amalur has stopped working, Is all I paid my money for, this rubbish doesn't even work.",0
"meh, it gets a little boring after a while. the game story doesnt have much depth, and it cant really compare to other games like skyrim. its fun at first but then once you realize it, it gets boring. Not too much to do in the game. If you are looking for a free world rpg, get skyrim instead of this game",0
"Someone compared this game to skyrim, which was a reason for me to get it. Well, turns out it wasnt, besides the fact that it indeed is a single player 3rd person rpg. To be fair, I stopped playing this game after a couple of hours (after reaching the Sidhe and completing the House of Ballads Questline), so I do not know if it gets any better. However, I really doubt it does. The Reasons are:   - the universe didnt really get me hooked. the graphics are very colourful and opulent, lots of eyecandy everywhere. But that does not help in any way to immerse me into the story. The atmosphere is sterile and feels more like a kitschy elven-themepark than a deep mystical forest full of dangers and fantastic creatures.  - the story sucks. Its just boring. The elves have split up in good and bad. The bad ones want to kill everybody, so you have to fight for the good elves to save the world. Yippieyeah, wake me up when its over please... Also, the quests are mostly senseless like rescue a guy in a cave, find a dead body, kill a troll, kill another troll, kill three trolls at once, kill a troll and a mage, stuff like that. Why you do this? Believe me, you stop to care after the third or fourth quest even though the voice acting is excellent, its most often stuff like Monsters attacked me, I lost something please bring it to me. why do I even listen to these bums on the road? Could just as well just walk around kill everything that moves. Which is pretty much all you do in this game.",0
"Just downloaded the game,when the registration information pops up, the video goes dark...even though I can still hear sound. I can Shift + tab and a screen pops up. Screen is only pitch black when I am trying to type in my information...Can anyone assist with this so I can actually play this game and enjoy it? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",0
"Yes, the combat is exciting and dynamic. Yes, this game has a huge number of loots... and Yes, this game tons of side quests. Yes, the world is large - OK, the world is gorgeous.  However, despite sinking numerous hours into this game, you'll still find this game somewhat lacking. It has a very uninteresting story. Quests, both main and side, are highly repetitive. I mean, hell - Diablo does have an even more boring story (it doesn't really have one, right?) but I feel a different kind of boredom playing this game - possibly due to the huge world, or samey environment everywhere.  By all means, get this game if you like the flashy combat experience (as said above, it has a decent combat system). But don't expect it to be anything interesting outside of combat. And don't even compare this game to Skyrim, where the world is much more dynamic.",0
"Many people will make the mistake of playing this game like a single-player experience. They will try to be completionists, working to finish every quest they can find.  Unfortunately, this game plays more like an MMO, which is to say there is far more content than you can hope to complete before you become over-leveled.  This also means, however, that you often can't tell the difference between a quickie one-shot quest that takes ten minutes to complete and a six-part branching quest chain that ends in a fantastic and unique reward you'll be grateful to have.  Play the game through with a guide if you want to get the most bang for your buck. Otherwise, play it casually. I don't think there's a medium to be discovered that could be considered entertaining.",0
"I really wanted to like this game, and I do in part. This was better on the consol. The camera angle is horrible and the fact that you can't target really crushes it for me. The leveling and quest are nice. The graphics are solid not amazing. I really like the way you pick a class and skills but thats about it. As everybody else has said the camera and targeting system really fails it. I would give it a C",0
"Really disappointing game. Takes two great game series -- Elder Scrolls and Dragon Age -- and perversely combines their negatives (from the former, an unvoiced player character traveling alone; from the latter, a world of constrained spaces and absurd, occasionally degrading character design), in the service of a plot that just isn't all that engaging. Combat mechanics are somewhat interesting; they're the only part of the game that is, and they can't rescue some of the combat encounters from being entirely too lengthy, tedious and occasionally frustrating. After about 30 hours, I got bored with the story and the world and stopped playing.",0
"Played the game on xbox and loved the story and gameplay in general, wanted to replay it on my pc, but it's simply not the same, there are just too many annoying glitches. The most annoying is the various crashes, i'm simply not a fan of a game that crashes whenever i try to save or quick save, makes it hard to maintain a delightful gameplay.",0
i didnt enjoy it cause it just seems to much like Dragons Age Origins. If it was more free roam and more army vs army instead of like every hacknslash game out there,0
"KoA is... a fantasy game. Pretty standard stuff. Too standard.  Maybe it is just me... I mean, I've loved the fantasy genre for most of my life. But I'm getting older, and these days, for a fantasy game to really grab a hold of me, it really has to stand out - to be unique and original - to contain at least some aspect that every other fantasy game hasn't already beaten into the ground.  I didn't see anything original or unique in KoA. I admit I only played it for half a dozen hours... but I think I played for long enough that, if it were going to grab me, it should have by then. And it didn't.  Combat was okay, but it felt pretty generic. Just like everything else about the gameplay, story and characters.  I hate to be so harsh; I'm sure there are other fantasy fans out there who would probably enjoy this. But at this point in my gaming life, I'm looking for a new spin on fantasy. Games like Dark Souls that approach fantasy from a whole new angle and aesthetic. I'm getting really sick of elves and orcs and epic battles against ancient evils where the world always hangs in the balance and it's always clear who the hero is (usually you).  If you want another fantasy game like all the others you've played (and there's nothing wrong with that) - KoA could be for you. It was not for me.",0
"First impressions were not positive.  -World of Warcraft is a strong influence. The narrative, visuals &amp; voice acting are boilerplate. If you've played WoW you already know how the story will be told and what it will look &amp; sound like, right down to the elves &amp; gnomes.  -The combat system is derived from God of War, perhaps? It works well for melee combat, but casting and archery are relegated to auto-targeting and feel dull.   -All player characters are male.  -The menus are awkward; lots of decending and ascending through menu-after-sub-menu with little aesthetic flare.   -The much maligned quick-time event also makes an appearance. I ignored it, but my character still produced a gigantic spear of pure light which he proceeded to plunge through his adversary' s face.",0

"I do enjoy the game, and I think it is a good way to quench your thirst for a game of this style. With more work this game could have really been amazing. An active modding community would even be plenly enough to save it. But sadly we will not be seeing any more progress on it. I suck at adding pros so i'll just be going into the details on the cons. (sorry if i am a bit too harsh)  Worth the purchase?  I would say the game is worth a buy when it is on sale, or if you are like me and don't have a pc able to run things like The Witcher 3 or Shadow of Mordor.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  + Overall fun gameplay and combat. Easy to get into and can find a good amount of things to do.  + The main story is pretty good. Really new and interesting plot.  + The respec system allows you to completely change your playstyle at any point for a small fee of gold.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  - Poor difficulty scaling.  Apparently when you enter a new area, it locks that area to your current level. So if you progress too fast or, like me, end up charging across the map in search of a challenge, the whole game becomes a cakewalk. (besides a few special enemies that do stupidly high damage compared to the rest)  I have heard that this also works for chests, so looting everything too early will hurt you in the end.  - Conversations seem to be lacking. Persuasion skill is useless.  I quickly found myself skipping through dialogue to reach choices to get past it, that often make no difference besides the next line the npc says. I even tried to make a few npcs hate me but nothing happened. (And apparently I am now lovers with some girl even though all I did was use her boat.)  The Persuasion skill, having 10 whole ranks, only affects the chance for you to succeed in rare, often pointless dialogue options, that you could just pass by quicksaving/loading. There are also a couple milestones in it, but all they do is slightly lower the cost of bribes for crimes.  - Equipment.  Many people say that upgrading your blacksmithing skill makes getting good gear too easy, but it seemed like the opposite for me. With max rank blacksmithing i only ever made a few items worth using since I could never find good materials , and ended up just selling all of my loot and purchasing better gear from shops.  Armor sets just stink. I have done a lot of exploring and looting but have never found more than 2 parts of a set besides when given to me. And even if I had, my gear would still be far better. Same story for most of the special weapons I get.  - Side quests are annoying.  There are a few I have done that I found interesting and enjoyable, but mostly it just became a case of skipping through, accepting everything, just doing them as I went to an area with an objective there.  This could also just be because I have played too many mmoprgs.  - Not enough variety in enemies.  Throughout the game you will be finding the same enemies even in far different settings, such as trolls, spiders, and pretty much any people. Even being in different reigons and factions, they will have the same attacks and skills.  - Plenty of annoying bugs and things that could do with improvement.  I have had quests break multiple times, even once before causing me to have to start a whole new game.  When you disable an enemy in reckoning mode, your character will still try to target them.  And many more little issues...",0
"this is a game that i withstood against buying for some time yet i wanted to give it a try cus I heard that one of my favourite author ''RA Salvatore'' took place in the game and here what i think: + ; cool, action-packed gameplay nice graphs open world, yet this may become problematic after a point... variety in monsters. - ; uninteresting story, plot no matter how hard you try, things are so dissatisfying. shallow after sometime you get bored. i dont find the game very addictive repetitive crafting system... 6/10 ",0
"I really really tried forcing myselfe to continue playing but i simply couldn't. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™ starts off as a great concept and at first it seems like a really fun hack and slash with a lot of customisation and strong RPG-Elements. But it isn't. You'll find yourselfe spamming the same 3 combos all the time while getting annoyed of hundrets of MMORGP-like Sidequests. I heared you people love +/- Lists so here you go!  The Good + Character customisation. You really have a lot of options and skills to chose from. You can also customise the apperance of your charater but the options are very limited so don't expect it to be as complex as in TES-Games.  + Voice Acting. Honestly i haven't seen the entire game but so far i think all NPCs where well voiced. With one huge exception. Your own character. All your character has are texts you can choose in Dialoges and the 'uh' 'uah' 'ah' in combat. This actally doesn't bother me too much as it's already a common thing in a lot of RPGs.  + Open World. There is actally a lot of loot and other stuff to look for. Would be a huge + if the game was genarally good.  + Decisions. Yay! I cannot tell you how much effect they have on the world around you but at least you can make some.  The Meh ~ Enemies. Not much variety for such a huge world but many of them require unique strategies to deal with them without losing too much life. For many of them it's recommended to learn their attacks and how to counter them.  The Bad - Generic MMORPG feeling. The Quests are getting boring after the first few hours and even if there is a huge effort to make the Quests interesing, it still felt like brainless EXP-grinding.  - Tons of Sidequests. Wait, how is that a bad thing? Well if the game isn't fun at all you don't want to waste hours over hours doing minor stuff so you can keep up with the level of your enemies.  - Combat. If the combat gets dull and boring in a game build around combat nothing else can safe the game from a bad score. The combat it repetitive and boring. At first it seems fresh and fun but after a few hours in you'll see how boring it gets when you spam the same stuff over and over again with the wepons(s) of your choice.  - Bugs. Tbh i haven't encountered any but i haven't made it far enough into the game to get to the buggy parts of it. Quests cannot be completed if you do stuff in the wrong order and things like that. So a lot of save slots are highly recommended.  - EA Account. Yes, it's one of those games where you have to make a third party account and have to be online to play a singleplayer game.  - Inventory. A barely sorted List of Stuff, that you can only extend buying a limited Number of Backpacks from some NPCs. This is the Part where you clearly see that this game is a console port.  3.5/10 Because EA didn't pay me",0
"I honestly can't recommend Kingdoms of Amalur unless you buy it on sale. It isn't a bad game, but it certainly isn't good, either.  Some of the major problems I have with it include a terrible camera, generic story and setting, boring and uninspired RPG elements, bloated busywork sidequests, and a combat system that would be fun if not for groups of enemies that stunlock the crap out of you.   That said, I DO think it is a decent timesink if you are looking for one. I just think that your money is going to be better spent elsewhere.",0
"It's a fun game to start, but could be much shorter. So many of the quests are 'fetch 10 of this' or 'kill 10 of that'. It gets boring quickly. I feel as though they made a massive world, put the main story in, then realized it was still mostly empty.  I outleveled every zone quickly before finishing most of the faction and side quests, forcing me to increase the difficulty just for a sense of fun.   You can respec at any time, so there is no reason to play through more than once.  I haven't quite finished all the DLC, and I don't plan to do so.  It's a decent game and the world had potential, but I think it missed the mark. I'd recommend something else for your fantasy-rpg fix.",0
15 hours into the game and I encountered a bug which makes it impossible for me to progress further into the game. Apparently I have to restart to get it to work.  No thank you.,0
"Kingdoms of Amalur is at odds with itself. On the one hand, it strives to be an epic fantasy along the lines of Skyrim or Oblivion (or even WoW). On the other, it is an arcade action game. The arcade part is fun. The rest... not so much. The backstory and the lore are dull, as are most of the voice actors. Quests are generally interesting... many are simple fetch quests or kill monster X at location Y. But many are multi-part with intriguing backstory.  The story has something to do with your character be exempt from fate because you were resurrected from the dead. And other characters want to help or exploit you. Or something like that. But, as a whole, it just doesn't come together. There's nothing compelling about the story. The mini-games pale in comparison to their Bethesda counterparts. I clicked through every dialog tree as quickly as possible. There are stones scattered in the world which, when touched, divulge some of the lore via a voice-over. I couldn't pay attention to a single one of them.   Now, on the combat side, it resembles more of a Darksiders flair. You roll around to avoid enemy attacks and wait for the right moment to close and shred your opponent. Some monsters just absorb hits until they die. Others will take a few before striking back. The only downside is that it becomes repetitive. Each dungeon has the same types of monsters, reasonbly spread across the map. But after my 5th encounter with kobolds, for instance, I was ready to move on.  Kingdoms of Amalur sports an RPG element. Your character levels up and points can be allocated into different skill trees. Some of them unlock cool moves that can be used in combat. Others unlock world exploration skills like alchemy (dull), lockpicking (dull), finding hidden stashes (dull), and the like. And, you can re-roll your character at any time -- a feature that I haven't used yet, but appreciate that it is there.  The game is definitely on the easy side, especially if you avail yourself of the powerful weapons available at the start of the game. Set the game on hard and pick less damaging weapons (like daggers) to make the game more exciting.   Nevertheless, with six hours into the game, I'm probably done with it. It hasn't grabbed me. And, as a gamer with limited time for gaming, I have to be engaged from the first moment. The story needs to be compelling. The characters (especially my character) need to be intriguing; their dialog something I listen to with rapt interest. And if not that, then the action needs to be exciting. Perhaps if it mixed the combat with some Prince of Persia like platforming elements, and downplayed the story/RPG stuff?  It feels too much like a couple of different incomplete games all squished together into a mostly ineffective whole. It's not enough to keep my interest.",0
"KoA: Reckoning is a single player take on the MMORPG formula complete with hundreds of uninspired fetch-quests and tedious, loot-driven character progression. I am actually relieved to have suffered a game-breaking bug 23 hours in, as I hadn't been enjoying myself since the 15-hour mark.",0
"Well.... when it came out, the developers advertised so well, that I choose it over skyrim. After I played the game I regerted my decision. The game is fine, it has refreshing story scent to it. Everything you do feels like a fantasy novel. However, it does not have the open worldness that it advertises, compared to skyrim which you can do much, reckoning's degree of freedom is very limited.",0
"Meh...you either love it or you dont, gets abit boring :(",0
"Bland, forgetable and frustrating. I'm sure I'd be able to appreciate the nice art assets if the camera were not so close to the character and mostly focused on the floor.",0
I played this game back then and decided to finish it this time around because of the Steam Sales.   It's a decent game but it has a lot of flaws. If you can stomach those flaws then you'll probably like the game.    -Story and Charcters are your every cliche in a fantasy setting. Overall the story isn't interesting and the characters aren't compelling. It's hard to even care much for most of the NPCs.  -They use the same voice actors multiple times and it starts to get weird that every other character or NPC sounds about the same.  -Invisible walls! Tiny pieces of cobblestone or rocks can become impassable although you should by all rights be able to walk over it. You're basically a demigod near the end and you still can't jump over certain terrain that visually you should be able to.  -The game has a lot of tedious fetch quest and it hurts since your character runs so slowly.  -The travel time between quests. Fast travel helps but you most of the quests are in between locations and you have to run slowly looking for items or NPCs.  -Very stiff contorls. It basically means that combos can often become awkward and that you can't cancel an attack once you click on the button. It just feels so STATIC although the attack animations and combos plus different weapon tactics are somewhat entertaining the first time around.   -Crafting in the game is a chore and more of an afterthought. You'll have no reason to use it once your character is upgraded enough and you can find better items through loot drops or chests.   When it was released it had nothing new to offer the genre and it didn't age gracefully either.,0
"This is a good game, just not a very good game. It has two things going for it: the story is alright (I especially liked the Teeth of Naros DLC) and the visuals are bloody amazing. However, the game is simply littered with horrendous design choices that make it fall short. Its name should be Extreme Walking Simulator. 1% of the game is talking to people, fighting etc while the other 99% is bloody walking; and the map is gigantic! I would recommend that you try this for yourself, but I can't recommend in good faith that you finish it.",0
"This game was not future proofed at all it seems. It struggles on windows 10 and for some strange reason having an Xbox One controller plugged into your PC will make the audio scratchy or cut out entirely. Xbox360 controllers work fine and the game is fun... but unless you have an old 360 controller and an older version of windows DO NOT BUY IT. IT WON'T WORK. I would love to recommend the game, but with how fast people are upgrading these days, chances are it won't be able to be played from your game library sooner rather than later.",0
"Too easy, even on hard difficulty. Calling that hard is a joke. Nice atmosphere but no challenge, therefore boring.",0
"I'd go into depth, but I really don't want to put the effort into something; no one is probably going to read.  Story is kind of boring. Basically you're some chosen one, who can change fate. Environments are kind of dull a lot of flat plains, and corridor dungeons. There's really no exploration. Combat isn't very fluid, although I only played a sorceror. Lore is boring, they have books, but they never captutred my attention. The dialogue is boring. You get choices, in to what you're saying, but in the end they're all the same. Even with pursuasion, it doesn't even have any real benefits. i gets repetitive and boring.",0

"This game actually started out the most enjoyable of the last several hack &amp; slash RPGs I purchased. The combat system is quite nice, and apart from the wonky camera controls, everything else feels good. Unfortunately, Several hours in, the game auto-saved immediately AFTER i unsuccessfully disarmed a booby trap on a chest. When I try to load the game, it goes straight to the game over screen. My options are to replay the first 2-3 days, or to uninstall and forget it. For now, I'm moving on to The Witcher 2.",0
Bugged. Don't buy it.,0
"My first impressions of this game were that it would be an immersive and exciting gameplay expierence. I can understand why people like this game but I can't stand it. It's a graphically down graded hack-n-slash rip off of games like Fable. But if I had to pick one thing about this game it would be the graphics. Now I know you should not ever complain about graphics in a game but this is an exception. During the trailer and all of screenshots they look nothing like the game on the Highest detail which leads me to belive they pulled a Watch_Dogs and used a graphics option that isn't made available to the consumer. Overall I'd give this game a 6/10, many things that are unique but had they not followed every single cliche in games liek this, being the 'Chosen one', having God Like powers etc. etc. I would have really loved the game. Either way, waste of money.",0
"Despite my NO rating - this game is not bad. If it's your first time experiencing an RPG, i would recommend this game, since it's on sale. Unfortunately i found this game boring, due to the constant talking and side questions. The controls arent the best and i felt no feelings for the game.  For friends considering buying this game. - If you have played other RPG games then there will be nothing interesting about this game. You would be better off starting a WoW subscription again or start on the game WildStar.",0
Way to easy even on hardcore mode. I didn't even have to try on the hardest setting; when a game is this easy it gets old fast.,0
"MMO style single player rpg, too easy even on hard difficulty.",0
"Ran into a bug that would have required losing only about 2 hours of play time. I realized that I had stopped enjoying the game about 30 hours ago and had no interest in replaying anything.  This game is a deluge of repetitive fetch quests. If you're going to buy this, only play the main quest line and don't burn out like I did.",0
"I've played too much WoW for this to be enjoyable. The combat is good-ish, but is hampered by the fact that the game even on hard mode isn't actually hard (infact I'd say that hard is very easy, especially if you try to finish all the quests in each zone and get overgeared). I would not recommend this game because this game lacks the polish that I'd expect from a single player RPG, and lacks the multiplayer advantages from an MMORPG. I completed the first four zones or so and found the game to be just too easy/monotonous to be enjoyable, and thus will not be finishing the entire thing. But if there's one thing I can say is that this game has A LOT of content (apparently anyway, I'm not sticking around to find out.), so if you can buy it cheap go for it.",0

"Some basic tips for the Standard difficulty.  1) Do all the available side quests before advancing the main quests.  2) Do not mix Finesse and Magic trees unless you can find daggers equal to your level. They aren't nearly as common as they should be. Otherwise, you can't handle enough damage and don't kill things quickly enough.  3) Dodging is not as useful as the game claims for two reasons.  3a) Dodge doesn't give you any tactical positioning. In fact, most of the time you end up with your back to an opponent that's already turned to face you, so you end up repeat dodging just to get clear without getting it while they follow you.  3b) Certain bosses are too fast for dodging to be useful. Or they have AoE's that are too large to escape with a dodge. There's also fighting multiple opponents at once. They flank and they knock you off balance long enough to hit you again.  4) Amp your resistances up like your life depends on it. It does.  5) Load up on potions. Your life depends on these too.  If you leave any of these tips out, be prepared for frustration and loud cursing.  Oh, and don't count on the NPC's that sometimes accompany you to be useful. They're not. They can't deal damage worth sneezing at, and some of them spend more time rolling around than stabbing things.  Last Tip: The boss at the Hyperian is multi-stage. Be careful about using Fate Mode on him too early. This is the one that got me so frustrated I uninstalled the game.  Enjoy!",0
"The game itself is pretty bland, there's whole world that nobody cares about with the usual kind of environments (forest, plains, desert, etc). Quests often have interesting premises but the tasks themselves are the usual go from point A to point B, fetch/kill/activate a thing there, come back for a reward. The combat is alright but it gets very repetitive because combat is all you ever do. The crafting system is interesting but it isn't enough to save this game. The music is nothing memorable, but can't say anything bad about it either. Also, there is a game ending glitch in the Dead Kel DLC, so beware of that. I'd say this game isn't worth the time you're gonna spend on it, so don't buy it, even if it's on sale. 4/10",0
"Finally decided to uninstall this - tried to play this on-and-off but it doesn't hold my interest, the game is like a fancy sword that lives in a scabbard which blunts itself when it's drawn. + Big game, lots of side quests, lots of dialogue - Boring quests, boring characters, boring mobs, over level for main quest + Lots of loot, crafting with alchemy and smithing - Too little inventory space, over powered weapons make the game too easy + Lots of different locations - Very same-ish dungeons, with boring travel to each new location (sparse mobs placement)  Dodge mechanic would have made this extremely easy game already too easy - except hit boxes and attack timings seem all wrong. You can roll out of the way but still get hit. But your gear will by mitigating so much damage that you can just tank everything even as a caster. One hit bosses totally possible because the side-quest will over level you. The game is 70% travelling, 20% mowing down boring enemies and 10% skipping mundane dialogue. If you want lots of mediocre content for cheap, this game is great on sale. Can't recommend though.",0
"Don't get me wrong. I love this game - great atmosphere, cool universe and species, nice graphics, pretty well polished. A wonderful example that Dragon Age's influence on the western RPG landscape wasn't a bad thing at all.  However, the plot is so damn slow. It drives me insane. I've stopped playing this game not because I don't enjoy playing it, but because I just can't get anywhere meaningful or do anything interesting. It's like a tech demo. Look at this cool RPG engine we built, anyone want to make a sweet game in it?",0
"While having some great concepts and mechanics, overall this game feel like playing a mediocre MMO solo all the time. The quests are all follow the dot and then run all the way back to turn it in, combat is pretty simplistic and I hvae found no real reason to actually pay attention to the dialogue or the extra information that you have no need for. The controls are also sluggish at times, where you will press keys multiple times and nothing wil happen. Your Power Up ability (X) also does this where you will be pressingit constantly but the mode is never entered.   So all in all, it is a decent MMO style single player RPG that offers little new to refresh the tired and overused components.",0
"I cant play. Every time I try to start a new game, it says that Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning™ has stopped working. Any Help?",0
Way too linear. Very disapointing.,0
"A perfect example of a game that looked so good on paper but was executed so badly it was exiled to a corner and no one wants to mention it today. All in all KoA: Reckoning is a solid RPG, it has a huge world with tons of NPC's and quests, it has rich lore behind the world that, most of the time, makes sense, and the game introduces things like the lorestones and Reckoning Mode to spice things up both on the RP side and the Action side.  Unfortunately pretty much every aspect of this game falls flat. The talent system is pretty redundant and mostly serve to give you passive bonuses you can fit your playstyle around (!), as any true RPG blacksmithing and enchanting is as overpowered as a Predator and the dialog is sometimes so bad that you wish you bought the game on a CD-disc just so you could throw it out the window.  All in all, if you're looking for the next Icewind Dale, Masquerade: Bloodlines or Dark Souls, this is not it. But if you wish for a Bulletstorm with magic instead of guns then this game will cuddle and snuggle you warm forever. Or at least the 50hours it takes to explore the world.",0
Unable to finish the game due to 2 gamebreaking bugs that cause the mainquest to not advance and those cannot be 'fixed' by yourself. No gamesupport whatsoever.   Don't buy it.,0
Crashes during the first playable segment of the Game. None of the fixes found online worked.,0
Bugs everywhere . The damn bugs cause you to uninstall this god damn game . I stuck in the dead kel quest and nothing i can do to solve that bug .So I just waste my money to buy this game . Surely not worth my money .,0
"I have actually enjoyed my time playing the game, but the crashes are just too numerous and I have to call it quits. I can't recommend it, especially for a game that utilizes manual saves.",0
Played this game on a console a year or so ago and I liked it. Now I can't play more than 5 hours of it and I don't know why.                                                                                              hey dad i thought we only play thouchy touch on wednesdays,0
Good: -Resonably good premise. -Interesting original Faction Storylines. -Unique Combat System.  Bad: -90% of enemies/zones/quest structures/character models are recycled. -Cliché telling of previously-mentioned premise. -Boring repetetive sidequests have you forgetting what the main quest actually is. -No interesting/memorable characters.  Sophisticated Conclusion: It's sooooo boring :'(,0

But the fun combat cannot cover the other complaints I have. First off, the characters are really boring. Not just the npcs, but your player as well. Though a somewhat interseting backstory, it doesnt grip me enough to play on. Same with the plot. The unintersting story, just doesnt flow well.(Dont worry about spoliers, beacuse i dont even know whats the plot) Maybe its due to the fact that Ive only played the game for 3 hours, and it picks up later on, but if it does, then thats a fail for a rpg. Or any game for that matter. These flaws already is a turn down for me. Fighting makes only half of an rpg, and story and character devlopment as the other(where this game fails to achive). There are a couple of minor flaws, but I think its more of a play style prefernce. So my verdict:5/10. A decent rpg with an extremely fun fighting mechanic, but lacks in essensial rpg elements. If this were a free game, i wouldve cared less, and probably wouldve given it a positive review, but if Im BUYING an rpg game, I EXPECT an rpg game.",0

"Not a bad game for a genre clone - this wannabe fable wannabe skyrim features gnomes instead of dwarves and Fae instead of elves, but other than that mostly conforms to the tolkien rules. The 'young races,' humans (which are subdivided into skyrim-like factions), are in danger of extinction because of the 'crystal war,' where the Fae 'Tuatha' have declared war because ♥♥♥♥ it, ♥♥♥♥ humans, I guess. The player is in the ever-imaginative position of an amnesiac who somehow has mastery of all weapon types, who wakes up as the Tuatha raid a gnommish outpost and from there I pretty much just stopped paying attention. The story is not very exciting.  The 'Destiny' system, where the player can build themselves between the three fantasy rpg classtypes (if you dont know what those are, this game would not be a great place to enter the fantasy genre), is a great idea, especially if you're a completionist and you want to see what total hybridization has to offer. The way the trees build is a little stupid though - there are like 9 types of weapons and you can put points into one weapon type at a time - if you go for full hybrid, like I did, you pretty much just suck with everything, which is what I expected. The level cap is ♥♥♥♥ing 40, which is GARBAGE - there are about 120 point slots for each classtype, so you can basically unlock a total THIRD of the potential of your game (I used a save editor to give myself more points because it was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). Gold is too readily available and doesn't restrict purchases at all, and the gear tries to be like diablo but it just....isn't. The looting is a little stupid. I'd give this game about a C, it captures attention at first but its flaws just rear up and are impossible to ignore. I loved tossing around chakrams and screw-attacking through people with my warrior-rogue-mage hybrid, but I got so bored I just left-clicked my way through the last third of the game.",0
"Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of the most disappointing games I've played recently; not because it's bad, but because it was almost great.  It seems to me after playing it that it may have been designed to be an MMO, but was converted late in development to a basic single-player-only Action RPG, one that's very light in design depth. The action side of things is a very standard hack-and-slash set-up that would be familiar to players of anything from Zelda to God of War. However, it's marred by bad mechanics, such as mobs that rotate to follow your dodge roll and the combination of long ability cooldowns and instantaneous potion use. Rather than fight the giant bosses by blocking and dodging and using powerful spells, it's much more effective to mash attack while tapping the health potion button.  The RPG side fares worse, with talents and skills that are usually completely worthless, but punctuated with a few over the top broken abilities (such as Elemental Rage). There's also the likes of Dispel and Lockpick, which are worthless as dispelling rarely works right and lockpicking rarely fails, regardless of how many points you have. Participation in the story is just not there, apart from the tiny handful of 'Rescue Orphans or Eat Kittens' choices. (The overwhelming appearance of the yea-or-nay choice in dialogue is usually a 'But Thou Must' situation.)  On the other hand, the world, story, writing, and presentation are top-notch. (Well, apart from the 'We call Elves 'Aoeuolhffwvyr'' problem and the ripping-off-Warhammer graphics that were already old when Warcraft 3 came out.) Which brings me to the frustrating decision here. Is it worth putting up with generic, boring, poorly-designed gameplay for a fun, well-realized, and utterly huge RPG world? For my part, I say skip it. You may enjoy it, but only if you can put up with the problems above.",0

the story is boring,0
"Kingdom of Amalur:Reckoning is a game that isn't special in any way, shape or form. At first it was designed to be an MMORPG, which shows in its world design. Sadly this design is completely uninspired, having different areas connecting awkwardly with a linear dungeon every here and then. Due to trying to be an MMORPG at first it is filled with a WoW-esque cartoony artstyle, minus the talent that was present in let's say WoW vanilla, TBC and WotLK. Even at its highest difficulty, 'hard', this is a game with zero difficulty. Primarily caused by the fact that you attack very fast, hit hard and have a great reach with most weapons. Secondarily caused by a gimmick that many games have, you, as the main character, receive some nonsense overpowered abilities that no enemy in the game can actually do anything against. So even if you somehow find an enemy that you can't stunlock in this game, you can just activate your power which slows down time and makes you hit harder to stunlock it anyways. But by all means, if you're interested in a game with a forgettable art style, boring story, combat so easy that you can hardly call it a game, poor voice acting, poor dungeon and world design, then this is the game for you.",0

My reaction? Not great...  First the technical difficulties with this game were overwhelming. The camera itself seems to have the most issues. The positioning of it is downright terrible. It really does take a lot out of the game when you have difficulty seeing the enemies or even moving efficiently. Despite it's age this has not been fixed through a patch so I was forced to download third party software in order to play the game. Next the game is actually fairly unstable. Even before I downloaded the fix it would crash frequently. It seems like the game was released too soon and then not supported. Really upsetting.  I had a lot of difficulties actually getting into this game at first. The gameplay is not very gripping even as far as RPG's go. The game also seems rather directionless. Not to mention the world you play in lacks almost all description of itself. You're required to assume things from context for a variety of the different storylines. This is especially true for the lore mechanics. I found the elves songs difficult to understand at first. Later I found out they're kind of like events that repeat themselves for some reason.  ,0

"Combat is really good, other than that its a pretty simple RPG with a lack luster story, I reccomend the Witcher 2 or 3 over this game if you are looking for both good combat and great story. In short other games can satisfy that itch better than Kingdoms of Amalur can.",0
"to be honest this is not like an offensive game, id even say its a decent game, but it has a bunch of really bad design decisions  i wont go into extensive detail, the story is nothing out of this world, its servicable at best, but thats enough, gameplay's fun enough for the first 2 hours. the main problem with the game is that it feels like they tried to make an MMO instead of an rpg. playing this game felt like i was in an empty mmo server, its really big, the quests feel like mmo quests, theres TOO MUCH TO DO, the quests mean nothing after a while because by the time youve completed a few of them you overlevel the area and theres still 10+ quests left in there. i have 18 hours in this game, i completed the main quest, hunted a few achievements and gave up when i saw that i had the dlc from the time i bought it on sale, i got everything i could get out of the game and then a bit more. in the end, the game is just a long long grind and i didnt have that much fun to begin with  if you have a lot of time to kill and dont have completionist ocd then get it, but this is just dumbed down skyrim, which is basic enough on its own.",0

"This game is obscenely huge. My guess is that it's about 3/4 size of vanilla WoW, and it kinda feels like wow. It has tons of dialogue and quests, all of which have voice over. It must have been very expensive to put this thing together.   Combat system is solid, you have to actively move around dodge or parry/block incoming attacks. There are 9 type of weapons and each type lets you perform different moves.  You can develope your character in 3 main ways (destinies). Warrior, rogue, mage or you can mix there 3 trees to your taste. But spending point in trees lets you unlock so called Twist of Fate cards which provide you additional bonuses, the more point you spent in one tree the better cards you unlock (capped at 109 points). There are cards for dualdestinies or even tripledestiny if you choose to distribute your point in all 3 trees, but point are limited so you may not have enough to get the highest tier abilities in trees. And if you build you character 'wrong' or you are bored by one playstile you can always visit a Fateweaver npc who will reset you pints, for a price.  Last but not least there is this  reckoning . It's basicly a god-mode you can activate when your  fate bar  is full, you gain fate in combat. Time slows down and you deal additional damage, your fate bar slowly drains. Whenever you defeat enemy in this mode you can perform spectacular finisher and thus gain up to 100% experince for every enemy you defeated before you chose to finish one.  It all sounds good right? Almost too good, and that is the problem. Due to game's sheer size there a high probability that you will get bored, sooner or later gameplay becomes stale. Also story isn't the best, it starts off with rpg's evergreen cliché, amnesia. And honestly in the end I wasn't paying much attention so I'm not entirely what was the deal with your protagonist.  I'm not saying that there are no player who would enjoy this game from start to finish, but I'm certainly not one of them. It took me several hour to get to it, then I had fun and 40 hours later it was getting more and more boring again and I rushed through last 2 regions (Klurikon &amp; Alabastra).

"Bought this game after getting an itch for a new RPG. A lot of the game reminded me of Dark Souls, since the combat was pretty unforgiving and required precise timing. You cannot hack and slash your way through the game, which I liked.   However, if a game is going to be unforgiving, I am going to be the same way towards its polish. KoA has some pretty bad camera work that make timing the perfect dodge or counter attack near impossible once an enemy dashes behind you. The direction your character attacks is also subject to this issue. Spent far longer than I should have on some fights purely because the camera disagreed with me all too regularly.  The quests have the depth of your average MMO (go kill X enemy type, fetch Y item for me). I simply ran out of reasons to push forward through the game and was too frustrated by its problems.  The game also doesn't come with any options menu of any depth, if that's important to you. It feels very much like a mediocre (but not terrible) console port.  Unless you have a strong desire for a tough RPG, I would stay away. If you happen to really love those types of games, you may be able to push through the issues.",0

"It's pretty decent gamplay-wise, but the quests are for the majority a load of fetch quests and such.

If you DO want to get it, wait for a sale.",0

"I want to like this but the camera is just plain awful. When you aren't in combat it's too close to the character so that you can't see a thing going on around you, and when you are in combat it tries to zoom out to give you a good perspective but often your character will just go off the screen. Often in the game I was just spamming buttons because I couldn't even see myself or the enemies. It's terrible at following the character and hard to put up with for a game that has hundreds of hours it expects me to sit through.",0
"I was only able to play 26 hours of this game before i uninstalled it. I really tried to get into it, but there are a few things that just really got on my nerves me and makes it unenjoyable.   My main issue with it is the camera. You are stuck looking directly over the shoulder of the character with no way to zoom out and its extremely frustrating. I like to have the control to zoom out further and this honestly seems like such a simple fix, I am surprised that it hasnt been included in the game yet through some patch. I guess developers don't care. maybe it was because they didnt spend much time on the maps and you would be zooming through objects, i dunno.  I tried the widescreenfix program on many different settings and to get zoomed out to the point I enjoy it around 100-110 degrees, the image is so fisheyed and distorted. That and it has issues phasing have to constantly keep resetting it with the hotkey etc. Honestly, just comes down to the fact that the majority of my gameplay seems to be focused on getting a nice camera vantage and less about the game itself. The widescreenfix is really not meant for this, its meant more for spreading games out onto multiple displays. The fix should of been implemented by the developers and seeing that people have been complaining about this since it's release, that's just disappointing.  I was not drawn into the story. Seems like a cool premise, but the quests are rather boring and the landscape and dungeons honestly start to feel the same, I've cleared the majority of the western map, including its dungeons now and there's different textures and what not, but I feel like i'm just running down a tunnel everywhere i go. I have no issue with linear maps, dragon age was a great example of how linear maps can still be done right, but these are just dull. I just didn't feel attached to the lore and the world.   Combat is kinda cool. Similar to guildwars 2 in that you get different attacks based on weapons. Spells come from talents. I enjoyed the combat.  Fast travel system is nice, but there are still some dungeons that are really large and you can't fast travel from within them, so you must run to the exit. Spend 5-10 min doing that some times. meh  might be good for some, but honestly I just uninstalled it cuz of the camera. That seriously killed it for me. Fans probably can turn a cheek to it.",0

"I put WAY too much time into this game. Completing the main plot, and almost every quest midway though the world. There is certainly a lot to this game, and it seems to check all the boxes for a good RPG. However it's repetitive combat, forgettable gear, and MEH story will stop being fun long before the game is even close to ending. I only beat it so that it didn't beat me. If you must play this game, don't bother getting sidetracked, just hack away and hope you get to the end before what fun can be had wears thin.",0
"I really wanted to like this game,but there are just to many flaws for it to be good.  Textures that overlap, feet that go through the ground. Plus the fact you cant zoom the camera out or change your FoV but during combat sometimes the camera will swing way out and then back in for no apperent reason. The game has interface lag. And even with all the eye candy turned on this game really doesnt look that great(in context for the year it came out). It reminds me of WoW which isnt saying much. The story is somewhat interesting but the side quests are boring and some are downright tedious. The combat system has potential to but is let down by a poorly thought out skill system and all the other issues I previously mentioned.  Its to bad. The game has a ton of potential, but in typical EA style , it feels like a cheap take on a great idea. A game is rushed out ASAP with no concern for being above average.",0
"The story is BORING, which is surprising because of all the fantasy writers attached to it. Too many cooks in the kitchen? I didn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about my character or anyone else.

"I had been looking forward to playing Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning for quite some time. The action-RPG style was very appealing as most combat in this genre is point-and-click clunkiness.   To my initially great pleasure, the combat was just as I expected, similar to Darksiders but as I played further, I found it to be very boring and repetitive. The same attack sequences, the same types of enemies, the same thing... over and over. So while the combat was good to start, it failed to hold my interest in the long run... even after unlocking the full tree.  The stories (main and side) of KoA are extremely bland. Only towards the very end did the main story line get somewhat interesting then it felt completely rushed and overlooked in the interest of ending the story. If you play RPGs for a deep story, you will not find it here.  I was very disappointed to find a level cap of 40. If you most of the side quests, you will hit this well before the end-game. Sure you can respec any try a different playstyle or character build but in the end, you will still be maxed at 40 which truly only allows for one specialization.  The amazing choice/consequence of alternative games was non-existent in KoA. You have dialogue options but none that really affect the story or outcome... so while the game says you decide your fate, this is hardly the case.  Graphically, the game looked decent. Some of the textures (especially grass) looked awful but it ran very smoothly. Music was good and very fitting.  The crafting aspect allows you to create any kind of weapon/amor you want. This is a pretty nice feature as it does allow you to customize gear according to your playstyle.  On the plus side, the DLC (Teeth of Naros and Dead Kel) were both excellent. They are fully developed and not quick to complete. Both were definitely worth the extra money.  Overall, I was disappointed with KoA. The repetitive nature and linear choice/story made for a bland experience. My rating is 6.5/10.",0
"I tried to get into it, I really did, but it just feels... wrong. I've heard before that Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning was a failed attempt at an MMO and I'm afraid it shows. Between monsters constantly spawning up and quests being largely inconsequential I can't help but feel I'm playing a single player MMO. The combat is obviously what is going to bring in most people and it is entertaining but it gets really old really quick. As if that isn't bad enough the level up system follows that bad system that keeps getting thrown around where you only buff up a few things by a couple percents for every point *cough*Borderlands*cough*. I don't give a damn if I now have 3% to crit as opposed to 2.5%, I want to feel like that 1 point can completely change my character. Instead of busting out an abacus to figure out which percent is better to raise I should be able to tilt my head back and ask myself 'How do I wanna ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up today?'.  tl;dr it's a failed attempt at an rpg, give it a pass unless it's on a huge sale and the combat really grabs you",0

Great combat, pretty graphics, awesome lore ... I just can't play it, is all. Most of your play time is spent walking, exploring, travelling ... it's impossible to enjoy that when you have to button-mash to do it! I've tried all the fixes I could find, and nothing helps.

"This is a pretty long game with good voice acting and story for the main quest line, but outside of the quest cutscenes most of that time is spent doing unfun things. Travelling, fighting, looting and mini games all are just not done well compared to many other games.  The fighting is way too easy to be any sort of fun and when your character is hit you stagger which interrupts any sort of flow. If an enemy does manage to hurt you, instant use health potions make it impossible to ever die in this game. Enemies popping out of the ground constantly is annoying and you may quickly find you get sick of it all and just run past as much as you possibly can. If you ever get into a tough fight, you have an *I win* slow-mo mode that also gives you bonus XP for using.  The looting is crazy, with chests littered all over the place. You'll quickly fill your backpack with loads of vendor trash to accumulate useless gold with. On top of that your armor takes damage for no apparant reason so you will have to go back to town to get repairs.  Inventory management is a pain with the massive piles of loot you get, which isn't helped by the fact that there are a billion different slight variations of potions you'll never use because the fights are so easy. Also many quest items are bugged and will permanently suck up your inventory space, yuck.  The minigames are just dumb time wasters. There are two to unlock chests, the lockpicking mostly is just holding a key down and waiting as the default position will unlock a chest most of the time. The dispelling of a chest is slightly more interesting but quickly becomes tiresome on the far far too common chests.  Outside of the main quest line and faction quests, which are good, there isn't a lot of variety with most being go to spot X on the map and kill a bunch of things and come back. The pirate DLC quest series is a standout and if you do decide to get this game (don't) and make it to Rathir then pick up the 'Legend' DLC as it is as good if not better than the main game.  This could have been a pretty awesome game with some tweaking but the good bits are buried under way too much tiresome muck you need to shovel through.",0
I play for ten minutes and it shuts off!! wtf!!,0
Meh. Just a bit typical.,0
"Edit. Worth it for £5   Well, I cant really recommend this game, reason being is that it doesn't seem to engage you as much as you would like. At full price this game seems to be worth it at first but i however, lost interest about 9 hours in, you might think 9 hours thats quite engaging. Not for a game this large. The games storyline is one that is quite typical, bad guys trying to gain power and all that, i started skipping conversations with characters about 2 hours in as i thought my time was being wasted as the story wasn't thrilling, and there didn't seem to be any backbone behind it all. Combat wise its a very good game, i played a rogue type character and enjoyed most of the combat, however the enemies do seem to be repetitively used in certain areas. With no variety of enemies, you found yourself using the same tactics multiple times just because they were most effective. Its a slick game that has great combat elements and a broad choice of combat styles but its not entertaining enough to keep you in",0
Very buggy! Buy with Caution!,0
"Skyrim for 12 yr old.  Good: Graphics Fighting mechanics Game controllers support is amazing (Playing with 360 controller is better, than keyboard)  Ok: Storyline Open world with side quests and frations  Bad: Looting, inventory and selling/buying stuff. Absolute headache.  Leveling and skills. Need to check from 3 different menus what to level up.  The game is quite easy, interesting if you haven't played Elder Scrolls series or other Open World RPG. No gore or whatsoever.",0
"I ALMOST recommend this game with strong reservations. If you can find it cheap, it's a good way to waste a few hours. The accent here is on waste, though.   It's not particularly fun after the first few hours and you quickly realize it's all exactly the same. Once you get higher level, there's... nothing. There's no THERE there. The game is incredibly shallow. There are a number of very enjoyable elements:  Character customization Action-combat Well-flushed, if very vanilla, world Crafting system is an excellent idea, if badly implemented in late game  The problem is that the game is entirely too large. It should have either been much shorter or had a much larger variety in the mechanics. Once you get high level the whole thing's BORING. You cakewalk through quest after quest and get the same unhelpful rewards. The 'oh boy I found the next tier of gear' effect is quickly lost and the entire thing just gets old. Money quickly becomes a waste when you're making all your own gear based on what you loot off monsters.  Basically, the whole game is very unimaginative. I know now why it didn't sell as well as the developers needed it to. It's just meh.  TLDR: 6.5/10 - Starts out great and quickly becomes dull.",0

"This game is obscenely huge. My guess is that it's about 3/4 size of vanilla WoW, and it kinda feels like wow. It has tons of dialogue and quests, all of which have voice over. It must have been very expensive to put this thing together.   Combat system is solid, you have to actively move around dodge or parry/block incoming attacks. There are 9 type of weapons and each type lets you perform different moves.  You can develope your character in 3 main ways (destinies). Warrior, rogue, mage or you can mix there 3 trees to your taste. But spending point in trees lets you unlock so called Twist of Fate cards which provide you additional bonuses, the more point you spent in one tree the better cards you unlock (capped at 109 points). There are cards for dualdestinies or even tripledestiny if you choose to distribute your point in all 3 trees, but point are limited so you may not have enough to get the highest tier abilities in trees. And if you build you character 'wrong' or you are bored by one playstile you can always visit a Fateweaver npc who will reset you pints, for a price.  Last but not least there is this  reckoning . It's basicly a god-mode you can activate when your  fate bar  is full, you gain fate in combat. Time slows down and you deal additional damage, your fate bar slowly drains. Whenever you defeat enemy in this mode you can perform spectacular finisher and thus gain up to 100% experince for every enemy you defeated before you chose to finish one.  It all sounds good right? Almost too good, and that is the problem. Due to game's sheer size there a high probability that you will get bored, sooner or later gameplay becomes stale. Also story isn't the best, it starts off with rpg's evergreen cliché, amnesia. And honestly in the end I wasn't paying much attention so I'm not entirely what was the deal with your protagonist.  I'm not saying that there are no player who would enjoy this game from start to finish, but I'm certainly not one of them. It took me several hour to get to it, then I had fun and 40 hours later it was getting more and more boring again and I rushed through last 2 regions (Klurikon &amp; Alabastra). This game has certaily it's value it's just not that fun to play for long. Maybe it's way too big.",0
"For people who likes lots of grinding, lots of items and lots of quest which most are boring it's the place to go.  For people who like to be surprised while questing -&gt; this is not game for you.   If you want to play it try to not do all side quests which most are boring and you must make sure you play hard difficulty.",0
"long and monotonous. it's like a single player WoW, which i thought was great at first. but the world's too large and empty. tons of pointless quests, which i abaondoned doing about 10 hours in. story's genaric.  pro- really nice to look at  2 out of 5 stars.",0

Great game but it keeps on crashing on my machine. The troubleshooting suggestions given by the forum and the support is a waste of time.,0
"Edit. Worth it for £5   Well, I cant really recommend this game, reason being is that it doesn't seem to engage you as much as you would like. At full price this game seems to be worth it at first but i however, lost interest about 9 hours in, you might think 9 hours thats quite engaging. Not for a game this large. The games storyline is one that is quite typical, bad guys trying to gain power and all that, i started skipping conversations with characters about 2 hours in as i thought my time was being wasted as the story wasn't thrilling, and there didn't seem to be any backbone behind it all. Combat wise its a very good game, i played a rogue type character and enjoyed most of the combat, however the enemies do seem to be repetitively used in certain areas. With no variety of enemies, you found yourself using the same tactics multiple times just because they were most effective. Its a slick game that has great combat elements and a broad choice of combat styles but its not entertaining enough to keep you in",0
Very buggy! Buy with Caution!,0
"Skyrim for 12 yr old.  Good: Graphics Fighting mechanics Game controllers support is amazing (Playing with 360 controller is better, than keyboard)  Ok: Storyline Open world with side quests and frations  Bad: Looting, inventory and selling/buying stuff. Absolute headache.  Leveling and skills. Need to check from 3 different menus what to level up.  The game is quite easy, interesting if you haven't played Elder Scrolls series or other Open World RPG. No gore or whatsoever.",0
"I ALMOST recommend this game with strong reservations. If you can find it cheap, it's a good way to waste a few hours. The accent here is on waste, though.   It's not particularly fun after the first few hours and you quickly realize it's all exactly the same. Once you get higher level, there's... nothing. There's no THERE there. The game is incredibly shallow. There are a number of very enjoyable elements:  Character customization Action-combat Well-flushed, if very vanilla, world Crafting system is an excellent idea, if badly implemented in late game  The problem is that the game is entirely too large. It should have either been much shorter or had a much larger variety in the mechanics. Once you get high level the whole thing's BORING. You cakewalk through quest after quest and get the same unhelpful rewards. The 'oh boy I found the next tier of gear' effect is quickly lost and the entire thing just gets old. Money quickly becomes a waste when you're making all your own gear based on what you loot off monsters.  Basically, the whole game is very unimaginative. I know now why it didn't sell as well as the developers needed it to. It's just meh.  TLDR: 6.5/10 - Starts out great and quickly becomes dull.",0
"Combat is really good, other than that its a pretty simple RPG with a lack luster story, I reccomend the Witcher 2 or 3 over this game if you are looking for both good combat and great story. In short other games can satisfy that itch better than Kingdoms of Amalur can.",0
"to be honest this is not like an offensive game, id even say its a decent game, but it has a bunch of really bad design decisions  i wont go into extensive detail, the story is nothing out of this world, its servicable at best, but thats enough, gameplay's fun enough for the first 2 hours. the main problem with the game is that it feels like they tried to make an MMO instead of an rpg. playing this game felt like i was in an empty mmo server, its really big, the quests feel like mmo quests, theres TOO MUCH TO DO, the quests mean nothing after a while because by the time youve completed a few of them you overlevel the area and theres still 10+ quests left in there. i have 18 hours in this game, i completed the main quest, hunted a few achievements and gave up when i saw that i had the dlc from the time i bought it on sale, i got everything i could get out of the game and then a bit more. in the end, the game is just a long long grind and i didnt have that much fun to begin with  if you have a lot of time to kill and dont have completionist ocd then get it, but this is just dumbed down skyrim, which is basic enough on its own.",0
"So I purchased this game around a year ago and now when I try to launch it, Origin opens and requests a key code. Inputting the Steam key does nothing. Not sure why Steam is selling games that doesn't work with Origin titles?",0
"Very poor game. There's no freedom of moving, and you can't even jump which is very, very important.",0
#not impressed. GAME IS NOTHING LIKE FABLE - many people claimed that this was a game very similar to Fable. However they forget to mention its nothing like fable. Fable is a very richly created game with in depth areas to explore. This game however feels like alot less than that. It feels like Fable to some people because it mirrors or copies all of Fable the originals strengths. Yet again it doesnt improve anything. It actually takes away a lot of the fun nods that Fables combat offers. This game is for the faint at heart. Those that want to quickly smash through levels and complete a game. It is not for those that want a rich story with fun combat that never gets old. This combat system is way to simple. Fable series is better off witout any of this dont believe the myths that this game is somehow a lost link to Fable. Decent game but not anywhere near the hype.,0

Up until the game locked up and now will not load again it was --OK. Don't wast your money. There are two end boss fights that can bugg out and cuse the game to crash and not wrok again. EA scrwes up another game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"I realize that I played through this entire game and its DLCs and even went so far as to get 100% of the achievements, but I just cannot recommend it. It's not all negative, it's just... boring.   And it shouldn't be. The environments should be mind blowing. The character design should be good. The weapons and armor designs should be interesting. But, they just... aren't. They are by themselves out of context. The screenshots and such for this game make it look really interesting and captivating. But when you are playing, everything is really bland text-book fantasy cliche and so all these things that look really nice out of context become dull and boring when put together as a whole in the context of the game.   Also, the crafting system sucks and doesn't seem to make any weapons or armor better than what you can find in the game. Also, the random loot system sucks: you find a piece of a named armor set, but by the time you randomly get all of the pieces or even enough for it's cumulative effects to be useful, you've leveled up way beyond it and have found generic armor beyond its capabilities. And, I'm not sure if it is possible to make sidequests any more generic, boring, and repetitive.   The gameplay itself and combat are fine, I guess.   So, bad crafting, bad loot, extremely meh gameplay, nothing special combat, and incredibly dull cliche story and characters make this game just plain boring. If you are looking for a fantasy world to explore, you'd be much better of going and wandering around Skyrim again.",0

Game breaking bug in the main quest. Awesome. Wow.,0
"I would like to give this game a positive review. For all the good points, please go read any of the many positive reviews. I agree with most the other reviewers' points concerning sound, combat, UI, etc. There are two reasons this gets a thumbs down from me. 1) Remapping keys doesn't work. Well, it does, sort of. You can add new keys to binds, but you can't remove the old ones. The default key bindings don't go away when you make new binds, and there's no way I've found to fix that, and if you bind a new function to a default-bound key, you get the default bind plus the new bind. EG, by default SHIFT is used for blocking. If you bind sprint to SHIFT, it will now block and sprint, mutually exclusive functions since you can't move while blocking. Yeesh. And yeah, 'block' is on the SHIFT key and sprint is on the CTRL key. Double yeesh. You know what games use SHIFT for sprint? EVERY OTHER @#$% GAME EVER MADE. Fortunately you can use a controler, which is the option I went with, rather than messing with decades of muscle memory. The second reason I'm thumbs-downing this game is because, on Windows 10, on certain boxes, it crashes to desktop randomly and without warning. A search of the net led me to a horde of disappointed gamers with the same issue. The usual tricks, running in compatibility mode, disconecting peripherals (the game goes loopy if you've got a graphics tablet plugged in) didn't help me, and since the devs are no longer, there will be no patches. I'd hoped, in vain, for a 3rd party patch, but couldn't find one. From what I have seen during my anywhere-from-five-minutes-to-an-hour-before-crashing game sessions, the game looks great. It would be nice if it was playable.",0
"Do not buy even if its on sale for a dollar! This game has silly cartoon graphics and is NOT open world. It is the worst game I have ever bought even for 4.99.   1. Not open world 2.Nothing to explore 3. Cartoon graphics   BUY SKYRIM NOT THIS GAME. While it may not seem fair to compare the game to skyrim the reason I do is because of how they portray the game when the describe it.  1. They decide to throw in a name from the Elder Scrolls 4. 2. on Steam this game is listed under 'similar games to skyrim or oblivion 3.There is no massive open world. In combat it basically closes you off into a small area of the map thats where I lost the open world part. 4.The graphics are not just differnt their pretty bad even for an older game  Below I have how they described the game.

"Worst 10.3 hours of my life, The game just got more lame the longer i played until i couldnt stant it anymore.",0
"This game did not work for me. Constant freezing and stuttering, was basically unplayable. I know that this is a decent game but cannot recommend...I am reviewing this simply to warn those may consider purchasing it in the future. By the way, my system runs high end games perfectly, such as Doom, The Witcher 3, The Divison, etc...so my rig is not the problem.",0
Camera movement are very sloppy but combat is good not worth buying the full price so...6.5/10,0
"Sorry, but I can not reccomend this. While it has potentaial, ultimately it was too much like on offline MMO, just tons of fetch quests. Also there are TONS of bugs that will never get fixed since the studio went bankrupy.",0
"I don't know exactly why the three hours I played this game felt like three weeks, but it did, and it wasn't fun. It might be the MMO world which de-emphasizes any build-up to an interest in the story, or it might be that most of the NPCs have a large list of pointless conversation pieces telling me the exact same thing that another NPC just told me (none of which matter or are interesting). It might also be because when they introduce an NPC with some amount of potential, like Agarth, he just sends me on an errand and sits back. I do know that some degree of the not-fun has to do with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Skyrim-esque skills, which are neither fun nor intuitive - I'd rather not put points in lockpick because I'd rather never have to do it. Also, how do you farm an herb and get zero materials? Am I eating the plants as I'm farming them? Am I farming them with a flamethrower and rendering them unusable? Talk about unsatisfying.  Either way, the game emphasized all the negative aspects of an MMO - grinding and pointless fighting, uninspired dungeon design (because, again, it is endless hack and slash, not anything inventive), a story that felt both non-urgent and uninteresting, and a host of mini-game mechanics, like a dumbed down lockpicking mechanic, that make the game more laborious than fun.  If you wanna play an MMO, just choose one of the free ones with an interesting story or mechanics (at least in an MMO I have abilities to spice up combat). There just isn't much reason to play this compared to what else is out there.",0
"combat is broken as hell and the game itself is boring after the first time around, pretty bad replay ability. Combat is absolutely by far the worst element of this game however, since every monster attack will interrupt anything you are doing, and the block/dodge functions are clunky. Mad or naw, Mad",0
"My sister bought me this game on the promise that I would stop cutting off her fingers. However, I found it to be lacking in the areas of gameplay, graphics, story, characters, abilities, main menu, launchability, and accessibility. Having no arms myself, I found it very difficult to play this game and especially to write this review. 10/10 would never play again.",0
"This game was really fun for the firs ten hours or so. But by then you've got the combat system down and pretty much nothing can touch you. (I played on maximum difficulty level.)  Then you discover to your horror that there's about 100 hours worth of game in here if you're stupid enough to chase down all the sidequests (like me.). This has the honor of being the first open world RPG I played where I started hammering X to skip the dialogue, and I played NWN2 all the way through. None of the characters are interesting or likable, and the bearded elves are intensely boring people. They're also the ones with the most lines.  Buy it only if it's under 5 dollars so you can enjoy those first ten hours I mentioned.",0

"This game looked decent in the videos/reviews and I wanted to play a game of this type, so I gave it a shot. I was unimpressed. It quickly became work to learn the game mechanics and specifics as it was so boring and not fun. I did not like the game play or story. Skip.",0

"First off, the 6 hours on record would constitute my second time attempting to like this game, after about 15 spent a year of so back. Sadly, it's another failed attempt.   The game has a lot of quests, loot, crafting, decent combat and a very rich world, with extensive lore. Then why do I always feel bored 30 minutes into a play session? Mostly because it feels like someone took a generic MMORPG and tried to make a single player game out of it.  - The crafting feels useless, just a time sink. - The abilities, skills also feel useless, since your character grows in strength mostly due to changing equipment. - The open world feels empty - I felt like looking at one of those driving scenes in old movies with bad background work. The images change but you know they're not real. At some point pretending to use the steering wheel becomes pointless. - The rich world filled with lore I mentioned above? Completely boring and bland. For all the dialog available, I found myself skipping through it, realizing that I would forget it anyway 2 minutes after the conversation ended. - There was some thought put into enemy design, you will encounter very different types. Too bad the AI is truly poor, and you can literally go through them by button mashing away.  The only slightly redeeming quality is the combat, as it offers you plenty of options in killing those forgettable enemies I mentioned.  Overall, you might enjoy this to pass a bit of time, but it's definitely not worth going through the whole story. It's only the illusion of a fully realized RPG, and it's all downhill once that becomes apparent.",0
"4/10  This game has so much potential. I did enjoy the first couple of hours as I played it. But there are way to many side quest which makes it feel like the game progress really slowly. Which in turn makes it feel very repetative. The combat is rather one dimentional, it gets a bit better by the fact that you have a main and a secondary weapon. Also there varaity of enemys isnt that great either. For me it felt like much of the later fights was me avoiding getting hit couse every little hit staggered me so I couldnt attack and then pop in hits when there where openings. Perhaps its better if you use a quicker weapon and not a greatsword like I did. And talking about greatswords it felt like it droped alot fewer of them then of every other weapon. Well atleast compaired to longswords and hammers which I found plenty. I know I should have crafted a good greatsword. But then the entire loot system gets pretty boring as I can just craft the best gear. For the crafting to have been more fun there should have been rare crafting materials and that way not making looting boring.  I think it is worth giving the game a try. If you like the combat more then I did you will probably want to do side missions and let the game progress slower. Me on the other hand stoped doing side missions after a while and just got through the main story.  With a few changes this game could have been awesome. I think the world feels rather liniar even if its open. There should have a mount or similar for when you need to run a long distance (once you visited a place you can fast travel to it, and fast travel I did alot). The trainer system should have been made more clear. Lock picking needs a bit of tweaking, now its rediculusly easy (I didnt put one point into the skill and still I picked very hard locks only loosing 2-3 picks). Well in the end I do hope they will make a sequal which has a bunch of changes for the better.",0
Colorful Linear Skyrim Game reaches cruising altitude at around 40% game completion  3/10 No replay value,0
This game starts out great! Then becomes repetitive and a total drag. The DLC is terrible and the gear apparently scales with the time you downloaded the DLC... it does not scale with you character's actual level. Ridiculuous. Not recommending it. But dissapointed because it could have been a great game. The combat is solid.,0

It is an offline mmorpg structured to farm quest over quest with bland stories and the usual pick this and bring it there. The music is nice, the voice acting too and the graphic is enjoyable to watch with all the light effects of the skills. The pro of this game is the combat and skills that are really well made. The camera is the worst and you can pass by a treasure without even finding it. It is hard to go on with the game and it will probably be one of the few that i will never finish.",0

"Kingdoms of Amalur is not a *bad* game, but I cannot recommend it. It plays like a solo version of World of Warcraft, with better combat and so so many fluff FedEx and Kill X of Y quests that WoW might be embarrassed. The camera is also much to close on PC and seems to have a mind of its own. After having played it nearly 12 hours, I just couldn't find a reason to keep on going. It's bland, ponderous, and there are too many better games to waste time on a mediocre one.",0

This game is all hype and no substance. Recommended alternative: Darksiders, which uses the same game engine and peripherals, but has so, so much more to offer. And if you've already played it, play it again.",0
"This is a horribly overrated game, and it has no value aside from a vast world and semi-legit voice acting. If you're looking for a single player game of the same quality as a free-to-play MMORPG, then you may enjoy this, other than that - don't waste your time and money.  Combat and movement mechanics are horrid: if you're standing on a hill - your attacks go perpedicular to your character, so if an enemy is right in front of you and you're theoretically targetting them - your projectiles go right above their heads (or into the hill at their feet, if you're below them). There doesn't appear to be a way to cancel your long-charge combo attacks, so if you see a new enemy jump out from the side of the screen while in the middle of a combo - you're screwed, forced to just sit there and helplessly watch yourself getting hit. The game is completely 2D as far as the movement plane goes, there is no jumping aside from a few designated spots (with a special animation). Smallest rocks on the ground have huge collision boxes, making you walk all the way around them instead of over them, (and i'm not exaggerating - some of those rocks are maybe 3 inches tall, it is incredibly dumb that your character constantly gets stuck on them trying to walk past.). Leveling-up mechanics (skill and ability trees) and inventory management are pretty much straight from Dragon Age (and i'm sure a bunch of other much older games, but Dragon Age is the first one that comes to mind), so nothing original or unique there. I'm not exactly criticizing re-using old techniques, but just emphasizing the fact that there isn't anything ground-breaking which would make up for all the bad things. Graphics are at a World of Warcraft level. Considering how old WoW is, i'm sure that says a lot. And to top it all there are game-breaking bugs that there is no way to get around, aside from reloading a much ealier save game at the beginning of a quest line and trying again (hoping the bug won't happen again). I would have even forgiven not being able to complete that particular quest and just moving on to others, but this game didn't even let me do that - i was just stuck in one place with no ability to go anywhere. Overall - really badly made game. A 6 out of 10 at most. And if it wasn't for the slightly-above-mediocre art/music/writing, i wouldn't have given it more than 4 ouf of 10.",0

the game is good but the coding is awful its a buggy mess such a shame because it showed promise after the first 30 lvls into the game but now i can't start the damn game it crashes before it starts and now i have to fix it myself.  buy it with a discount and that's only if you are curious about what it has to offer other than that don't bother,0

"its like an mmo,but its jsut you wandering around exploring, so if thats your thing then buy but if your not into the mmo feel and the repetative feel of combat avoid this game.",0
"As someone who bought KoA during the sale, allow me to say that Skyrim is the better game in almost every respect. KoA had a combat system that's more fun at first, but it's obviously way too easy and suffers from a real lack of breadth in terms of options in the early levels. Every enemy I encounter I've tackled the same way. Frankly, I'd rather be stealth sniping enemies in Skyrim at this point.  What's unforgivable is just how soulless the game is. The NPCs say a lot, but no one has anything to say, if that makes sense. There's not a memorable character thus far, and it has a naming scheme cunningly designed to ensure you forget everything immediately. I run from objective to objective, but I'm not invested at all, there's just no reason to care. MMO in single-player form is what I've seen it called, and apart from a much more player skill orientated combat system, this seems spot on.",0
"This game really isn't that great, I mean the combat it fun, but thats about it. Everything else is just meh.",0
The mechanics are quite good but there's a distinct lack of variety to the combat.,0
after around 30 hours of gameplay i came across a game breaking glitch. the quest her rightous fury stops you from fast traveling. which makes getting supplies or doing quests a very big pain. i literally have no will to finish this by running everywhere with a map that isnt exactly small. if only i looked this up i would of avoided this. but then again i thought a game this old would at least have its glithes fixed! im so disappointed and very upset cause i was looking forward to playing this game for a while,0
This game is boring.,0
"It's like macaroni and cheese without the cheese. It's serviceable, but bland and leaves you feeling empty.",0
"The game is beautiful; the money spent on acting and emoting is top notch. Unfortunately, its just boring. If you like a seek and find adventure where you are put into a whole new story this is your game. If you are wanting something that hooks you and drives your character to go and do things you may want to look elsewhere.",0
"This game seemed to strive for the depth characteristic of the Elder Scrolls games, but it came off as cheap and simple. The story was forgettable and most of the characters were as well. The combat was entertaining up until I hit my level cap, then it was nothing more than an annoyance as enemies were no longer the slightest bit challenging. Even the final boss was simple to defeat while losing no more than maybe 10% of my health. I hit my level cap roughly half-way through my playtime (120 hours, including Dead Kel and Teeth of Naros DLC).  The biggest annoyance was the lockpicking. The controls are not fined-tuned at all, so it's nearly impossible to pick with actual skill, even when working on a lowest level lock with a fully leveled lockpicking skill. The auto-picking uses up a lockpick, even if your skill grants you a 100% chance of succeeding. Unforunately, you don't find enough lockpicks to go auto-picking everything unless you purchase lockpicks at every opportunity.",0
To me it plays like an MMO without all the other players,0
"From content standpoint this game likely merits a 90/100 score. its big it has a lot of stuff and quest and tons of voice acting everywhere, the artist are very creative, and it looks good, the game engine is suitably powerful and technically better than its competitor Divinity 2. its a very playable game. But...  ...I did not really enjoy playing it. I played about 92 hours, so its very playable or I wouldn't waste 1 hour with it. For I have no reason except the enjoyment of the experience (there may be some other reasons... but thats mainly what one plays a game for).  The main story isn't all that great. I never felt drawn into the lavish story line. The character are all meaningless, one never ever cares anything for any of them. I think the literary elements are destroyed by the open ended questing system (I would have closed the questing system so it must be played in a certain order. This would have helped much to draw people in to the experience). There is never any sense that anything matters at all anywhere in the world.  The inventory and character management system works, but I would say a patch should have fixed its crudeness. It should have been easy for such skilled developers to polish this system as it's so important to any game of any genre.  But my number one gripe by far for this game is the camera. I just don't want to play it anymore because I am sick to death of staring at my characters backside while I play. The camera is just terrible. All one ever does when playing is stare at the ground and at your characters backside. This should have been fixed immediately. It is the easiest thing to fix. Divinity 2 does a much much much better job with the camera. Though Skyrim V is the best and most popular of the genre I think. These sort of games need a first person perspective. The camera view is half the game.  There are other things too of course. But my other serious issues pertain to genre and game development descisions on a broader level, so to say, these sorts of problem are simply the norm right now. So I won't bother talking about them. I'll try to judge this game against its competitors, not because I have too but because I want too. If a developer reads this, -----------------FIX THE CAMERA!--------------------   The quest camera which locks the camera onto the face of NPC's whenever there is something to talk about in the game is also annoying, and would be better if it was more semi-iso-metric. The NPC's faces look stupid and wooden and I hate looking at them. I want to throw rocks at them and poke them with sharp things while they speak.   Games have always been stupid, idiotic non-sensical rubbish. One of the greatest in history involved single handly traveling to hell, completely alone, wading through hordes of incredible murderous demons. For a bunny rabbit... Literally...  I think this game takes itself wayyyyyyyy too seriously. For the level of literary wit it possesses. It wants to be super great and legendary, but its just isn't.... Its obvious the developers don't know much about anything, its just money, and that what they needed to remember in there case. They just want to make money and care nothing about all these extremely serious issues they talk about, that have nothing to do with money at all. In other words it would have been smarter to go more stupid rather than try elevate the genre up to a level serious literature. Why doesn't our hero just chase some ♥♥♥ into hell for all it matters. That would work much better.  Is it possible to create a game masterpiece? Will the game world one day have its truly great playwright(s)? Probably. But Kingdoms of Amalur deffinately ain't it.  I talk like this because there is a whole lot of talking and acting in this game and a huge heavey duty ultra-serious life and death and the meaning of everything and more than that too - plot in the game. Which is why I mention playwrights, and am refering to high quality richly respected writers in general. There is a real desire in the game that is obvious, to raise the medium of gaming out of its non-sensical idiot past, and make something really great. But in my opinion this effort eats turf.   I give this game a 60/100  Bottomline: if the developers fix the camera I would say one can have fun playing this amusing bit of rubbish. Theres tons of special effects and environments and tools and weapons and beasts and battle skills to use - though the death physics are terrible, but standard in the industry. I get no satisfaction from killing monsters at all. Where is the decapitation, the slicing in two, the smashing to bloody hamburger special effects. There is nothing, its unbearable to me. This game is so full of unholy filthiness and cruel unhumanity smashing the damn things to bits is the only enjoyment I get from playing and it isn't there, nothing - otherwise give it a pass. Actually just give this game pass. The market is soo bloated with options, players need to discriminate. No Affirmative Action for Amalur, time to move on. Time is valuable.",0
"So, you'll notice that I didn't invest much time in this game. It was suggested by a friend when I was needing a new game to play, so I added it to my wishlist and waited for it to go on sale.  When I finally was able to play it, I made it through part of the opening quest. The story seemed captivating enough...but the controls are *so unintuitive* that I just can't play the game. There is no strafe with q/e, you cannot move with clicking of the mouse, the camera feels overly sensitive. Not really pleased, would have rather used the money on another game :(",0
"Feels like running around inside the ghost of an MMO, which I guess it sort-of is. There were plenty of things that I liked about the game, but the empty feeling extends throughout, combat is entirely unchallenging (which is a damn shame as it looks and feels good, you just get bored of wading through mobs, swatting them like amazingly easy to swat flies. Pointlessly swatting already dead flies.), there are far too many meaningles and trivial 'fetch' sidequests, and the story really drags. There is stacks of lore but it was impossible to care about any of it in the slightest, because the whole game felt like an abandoned theme park.",0
"It sucks i quit. The game wont let me remap the keys so it is a waste of my time i cant adjust to using the w,s,a,d buttons.",0
"$20 was too much for this game. It has a playstyle that is a mix between Two Worlds and Fable, with combat like a mix between Fable 1 and 2. It is underwhelming to boring in almost every regard.",0
"The battle system is outstanding but not much skills to play and also are not creative at all, atfer few battles will get bored very quick. Special effects are just normal level, enemies are to many same appearance with different names quite sad with this part, the difficulty is toooo easy, even playing in the hard mode, story just ordinary so overall 70/100.",0
Crashes everytime I try going into a certain area in the game regarding the mainquest.,0
"This is a very well made and refined game, but I just find it hard to enjoy with so much better RPG's readily available in the same price range. The game is extremely repetitive and the 'revolutionary combat' is nothing more then countless hours of button mashing. The NPC's were not engaging or unique and offered poor and repetitive quests. Now don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad game, but for the 20$ price tag I would have expected much more out of this game. For a game that competes against both Dark Souls and Skyrim, this game falls short in almost every aspect. However the one thing this game does have going for it is it's reliability, it has very smooth frame rates and has never crashed on me. All in all, spend your hard earned cash on Dark souls, Skyrim or even Mount and Blade, not this generic button masher.",0
"Game crashes constantly, DRM apparently requires you to have an internet connection to play? Nothing that really stands out about the game in the short time I played.  I can't recommend it.",0
Love RA Salvador. Hate this game,0
"I might have enjoyed this game, but the camera controls are completely insane. Mouse right to turn the camera right and mouse left to turn the camera left *and* down? How did this make it all the way to release while being all but unplayable because you have to stop every three steps to reorient your camera?",0
Don't Get me wrong its a pretty good game. visuals are great and voices are well done. It's just boring and repetitive. The story really didn't pull me far enough into the world. The quests were mediocre fetch quests or kill that bad guy. Couldn't get far enough into it to care after awhile. It probably gets better later but I just couldn't find a reason to continue it.,0
"This game is a mish-mosh of a million tiny things that don't fit together well.  The combat sucks, flat out. Got old AMAZINGLY fast. The camera is garbage. Disgusting. Trash. Kinda nice looking at points, but kinda terrible looking at others. Dialogue system is super clunky and makes me wanna kick puppies.  Don't waste your time with this smoothie of a game.",0
"Great game, but overall, it needs patch updates for bugs and glitches within the game. Bugs that prevent you from progressing further in the game. Steam should put warning labels on games that are not patched.",0
"* If you want to check out any of the other characters besides the first one you are playing, you had better BACKUP those SaveGames because this game will wipe them because it can NOT track multiple characters.   I believe this is a practice from the 'Commodore 128s with a Hard Drive Days'.   I discovered that the 'new let me check out a rogue/hief character' can only Block OR Run Away.   Weapons can NOT be Drawn, hence they can NOT be swung OR fired.   I wish I had read this review before I had written it.   In answer to your questions: Yes, I checked that first thing. Yes, it works perfectly. No, all my other games work fine.  Yes, I looked there but nobody else has this problem or cared to answer. &lt;-- HEY! It must be me! Go buy this game!   Do ya reckon? ;&gt;)   ",0
Combat is not revolutionary or more interesting than any other RPG - In fact it's much more linear. Combat is not better just because I can spam buttons and things will happen. You don't even have to aim the bow ffs. The melee attacks are 'aimed' using vague directions of which way to swing.   The interface is clunky and irritating to deal with. The button mappings are restrictive and unintuitive.   The fact that this game used to be $50 astounds me considering the low quality of development - I paid $10 for it on a Steam sale and I feel that was too much.,0
"The game is so boring and dull you'll wish for a good pillow, the only way this is fun really is if you love games like World of Warcraft without the people to talk to and a lot less fun. I honestly tried to force myself to play this game through and I could not.",0
"Although i'm not a huge fan of the genre in general; i still feel that given the titles' high rating it should deliver more than the 'grindy' gameplay that it offers. Given the money i spent on the game, I struggled through the first couple of hours of the hoping to find something engaging. This didnt happen for me, so given that there is an overwhelming majority of positive rapport i felt i should warn that, for some people, this may not be a game you'll enjoy.",0

Yes, you got some stories about 'telling', Fae's and stuff, but after that you can just name every clishe you will remember.  But again, it's got some potetial. It's just developers didn't made it to solid and interesting game.  PS And when I'm tell you that this game is enormous, I don't kidding you, guys. By time when you will reach final stages, you could travel to China from USA. On foot.",0

"I thought driving rovers in Take on Mars was boring, then i finished Kingdoms of Amalur. This game is just a sum of zillion ultra boring quests. Stay away from this cure for insomnia....",0
"Okay so where to begin? Take a generalized fantasy idea, release it as an offline MMORPG and well, here we are.   Kingdom's of Amalur... Reckoning?   Usually we save these type of lowbrow subtitles for terrible sequels but I guess they just wanted to cut out the middle man and admit this game is straight up garbage right from the get go... that being said, here's the general idea:  It's the cliche, you're the chosen one except you just don't know it yet. You need to prove yourself to a bunch of lowlife commoners by fetching buckets of well water and killing rats in multiple cellars or 'dungeons'. Don't forget to pick flowers and melt down magic stones at alchemy desks as an annoying side meta game to the already implemented side quest meta game.  Again it's one of those games where being a thief / rogue / stealth character is incredibly beneficial. It's getting to the point where single player RPG's developed today should just lock you in as a thief and you can choose to allocate stat points differently if you don't like looting treasure in a treasure looting game.  If you decide to purchase it then prepare yourself for monotonous fetch quests, non-existant plot lines, you can skip over so you can fetch the next peice of candy, and average game play with long walks across open fields of nothingness.... occasionally fighting some disgrunteld vagabond's and wolves looking for their next meal ticket.  You will certainly be in for the 'reckoning' of a life time if you purchase it at full price...",0
I found myself fighting the camera more than the bad guys.   I can't be bothered to play an action-based RPG where I have to swing the camera harder than my sword.,0
"This game is terrible. The combat is sorely unbalanced, its the same hack and slash on repetitive enemies over and over and over again. There are three types of dungeons and they reuse and recycle. Its the same visual effects through the entire game. When they tell you theyve added 3 hours of content it means theyve added 6 Rocks Trolls each which takes 30 minutes to hack and slash to death. Its constant mouse and keyboard mashing doing the same move over and over again until the single target you are slashing on is dead. The majority of the moves and abilities are useless, the stealth system sucks, and walking through an area will pull every mob in the entire zone. 2/3rds of the way through the game I had 3M gold saved up with nothing to spend it on. The DLC is glitchy and the voice acting sucks. I understand why they didnt make a sequal, and the company who made the game went completely out of business. DONT BUY THIS GAME! HUGE WASTE OF MONEY when you can play Morrowind, Oblivion, any of the Dragon Ages, Skyrim, or any of the Witcher series.   The ONLY saving grace is that the weapons look cool until you hit the Prismere items later in the game. Then it looks like someone stole granny's red rock collection and forged it into armor. Bleh!",0
" GAMEPLAY:  3/10   STORY:  8/10  This game is impossible to enjoy with the field of view (FoV) settings.   The gameplay would be great...but that damn camera makes it unplayable. You literally end up fighting people off screen. I think there was a little attempt to make the camera zoom out in combat, but it's so wonky I couldn't really tell.   It's a shame. The story is good. It shows that R.A. Salvatore wrote for this game. The only way I could make it bearable was to mod the FoV to be zoomed out to where I couldn't really see the actually quite nice looking characters and equips. I don't see why they couldn't make the camera zoom out in combat to accomodate all enemies you were fighting.  Read the wiki for the story...don't buy the game.",0
dont buy the steam version crashes a lot,0
"I bought this game due to the sale price and the glowing IGN review... and holy crap this is the most generic RPG I've ever played. The art style is a direct ripoff of WOW, attempting to mask low poly counts and a lack of advanced effects with overly bright colors. NPC interactions are ripped directly from recent Bioware titles. The lockpicking system is an exact copy of Skyrim. I was willing to overlook the ugly WOW-clone graphics for an open-world hack and slasher like Dragon's Dogma, since the Fighter/Rogue/Mage class sytem is identical to that game (suprise?) but the combat lacks Dogma's satisfying brutality.   Normally I like it when elements of great games are remixed into something new, but it's all done in such a clunky way, it just makes me wish I were playing the other, better games.   Ultimately this game feels like something that was put together in a soulless board room full of suits who picked pieces of top selling games at random in search of cold, hard profits... and oh look, it's EA, so that's probably exactly what happened.",0
"Cartoonish look and clumbsy controls. Camera kept spazzing in too close or out too far, often behind objects so I couldn't even see myself. No wonder this game bombed.  UPDATE: tried playing some more. Still a mediocre game. Thumbs down.  Amazing how bad, clumsy, and sluggish the combat is. It's like playing an old NES 64 game. So bad.",0
"Simply put, this game is not worth the time investment.",0
"Very stale game, very predictable and nothing unique with the combat at all. All the spells etc. are the same overused classic ones. I am a fan of great games like skyrim, world of warcraft, fable I etc. and this game is just a cheap copy.",0
"I really wanted to like this game, but it just doesn't hold up in today's RPG, open-world market. Games like Skyrim and Inquisition make this seem like a Facebook game.  PROS:  + Fun character customization options  CONS:  - Doesn't appear to be designed for PC - Quests get repetitive - LOTS of walking and running thru bare landscapes - Dead easy - Camera angle makes me want to kill myself",0
"Camera angle is sickeningly close, and the limited view will give you an incredible headache. Want to zoom out? HA. You cant. Game is unplayable, waste of $20",0
this game is seriously TOO EASY WTH... combat is like your character in permanent GOD MODE. This makes customization of characters useless since hell anything will work against such weak enemies and bosses zzz,0
Played for half an hour. Game crashed twice. Can't really play it like this.,0
"I've tried several times to play this, but I couldn't get far into the game without giving up. It's a real chore to play and not worth your time.",0
"The game is more an action game than a rpg. And as such i can not recommend it. The fantasy is also quite thin in terms of story and lore, the scenery however is lovely.",0
I nominate this for the 'Test of Time' reward. Because this game never ends and will test your patience. I look forward to one day having the 300+hours essential to completing the tutorial.,0
Like a poor mans Skyrim. This game has character but the voice acting is poor and the combat can be slightly simple. I actually enjoy some of the mechanics a little more than some of the bigger budget games but I found myself becoming bored with the story so quick it wasn't enough to keep me playing.,0
"oh my goodness this has got to be the worse game ever , no way to zoom out camera, horrible gameplay just trying to control the character dont waste your money",0
♥♥♥♥ ass game. Waste of money.,0
Just like every RPG. Completly rubbish and boring.,0
"The controls. The controls man, they suck balls.  I played with an XBOX360 controller and then a mouse, neither of which did much to allieviate the problem of that slow, clunky camera and hyperspeed movement of your character. I fiddled with the settings but alas there was no way to get him to slow down and to get the camera to be responsive enough. It wasn't an issue with my hardware, as the game itself ran perfectly. My pc is fairly average, but still the game ran a solid 55-60fps.  The opening is very drab and dull, you're fateless do you don't die forever and now you have to something something well of souls I don't know. I honestly tried to keep up with the story and plot but it was just so generic.  The combat leaves much to be desired. There is no lock on that you control, the game decides when you are targeting an enemy all by itself. This functioned well enough, but I was really wanting a dedicated button to be able to break and change my target. The combat is tremendously slow and clunky. There is little to no skill required for bows, the daggers are overpowered and the magic is the most meh magic I've ever cast.  Now, granted I only just left the tutorial cave after the Troll fight, but I could not bring myself to play on. I was just constantly thinking 'This isn't fun, I have at least five other games on steam I bought in the sales that I could be playing right now.'  I do no recommend this game because the controls are absurd, some of the worst I've ever encountered (and I played Dark Souls with the mouse for a session), the setting and story is bland and the combat is lacking. How this game gets high scores and recommendations anywhere is beyond me. I even had my friend who had played the ps3 version take the controls and he said it felt very different. If you really want this game, get it on ps3.  If you still really want this game on pc, €5 is what I paid for it and I'm glad I didn't spend any more than that.",0
"I'm generally a fan of light hack n'slash rpg gamestyles but honestly.... couldnt get past the first few hours. Nothing compelled me to continue on. Obviously a good deal of effort has been put into gameplay fluidity and mechanics but it's a stale world and nothing you havent seen before. So this is what is birthed from talented designers, big budgets and EA's teat? After playing other action affairs like Dragon's Dogma, Tomb Raider and Deus Ex this winter, it felt as deep and satisfying as a spring puddle.",0
"Started out fun, but got super repetitive around level 25. It feels like it should be a huge MMO but you are the only on logged in. I ended up quitting about 25 hours in. YMMV",0

"I was looking forward to playing an awesome game like the elder scrolls. as soon as i started the game i knew it was going to entertain me for hours. but i didnt even kill those giant rats because the camera sensitivity was on hlaf. I turned it all the way down and it still was super fast. This ERROR ruined the game. Does anyone know how to fix this???? if i can have it on low sensitivity, thuis game would be 11/10",0
"There is no Co-op in this game, so basicly the steam lied to me about it, but it's 'okay' (i searched for a good co-op game when I bought it).  This game is like Fable in so many ways. But It feels 'incomplete'. So many things missed - like music? -, but the graphic is nice, the action is pretty cool, enjoyable. I read about the game time, 40 hour if you really now what are you doing, 100+ if not. Too much maybe?  So many cool things, but still, so many thing missed, so many part of the game is empty, 'cheap'. Kingdom of Amalur wanna be become a very good game, and It's got a good basic, but never reach the goal.",0

NO. JUST STOP. NO. By the time I finished the intro cutscene I had already decided that I would rather rip my own legs off using my kneecaps as tool of choice than even playing a single second of this game.  Thankfully there was no reason for me to do any of those horrible things and thankfully my legs are intact.  8/8 Actually made me cry!,0
Keeps freezing my computer on: windows 10 nvidia gtx 980 i5 Do not buy if you have windows 10 they will never fix this game,0

However, I'm four hours into the game and still don't feel that compelled to keep playing it.  Here are the reasons I don't really like the game: 1. The voice acting is pretty bad 2. I find the main story and the characters boring 3. Gameplay has been laughably easy so far 4. It doesn't compare favourably to Skyrim, Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights, Divinity etc. - just so many elements that are not as good. It doesn't have the atmosphere of a lot of these games.  I've pretty much given up on it, which is a shame as it was £20.",0

Trash in its purest form,0
"I haven't purchased a game with the EA logo on it since BF1942 due to their underhanded practices, but a friend highly recommended this game and even paid for it. With that disclaimer out of the way, on to the review.  Overall appearance: 5/10. Standard, generic, fly by night MMO look throughout the game. It is vastly empty, with very specific paths to follow. This is reinforced with invisible walls everywhere which prevent you from doing the simplest of tasks like jumping over a log. This kind of unpolished short cut methodology is fine for F2P MMOs, but not for a single player game. The armor sets are frequently reused, so you can have 3 or 4 different sets, yet they all look identical. The developers didn't even take the extra day to retexture the pieces for each set.  Combat mechanics: 1/10. This game has hands down, the absolute worst combat mechanics I have ever witnessed in any game. Even Revelation 2012 was better in this regard. You go to attack a specific enemy, and are instantly, uncontrollably attacking something completely different. This can include other monsters, but also can include a rock wall, the ground, or even nothing at all. This unpolished, wonky mess of a system can and will get you killed by bosses over and over.  Camera movements: 2/10. You have no control whatsoever of the bouncy, rubber banding camera, which frequently pops underground and into trees and rocks during fights so you can't see what's going on. If you suffer from motion sickness, take your pills before attempting to play.  Questing contents: 8/10. There is a lot to do in this game. Nearly town NPC will have some kind of quest chain for you to accomplish. Not just one Fed Ex quest, but actual, multiple leg quests. This is a nice thing to see in this day and age of single mission, gofer quests that most games offer. This doesn't allow for a great deal of replayability though, since the quests and dialogue are identical regardless of character build.  In general, this game feels just like any other fly by night MMO, with the one exception that there is no one else around. The armor sets leave a lot to be desired, using the same pieces for several different versions. And with the horrendous camera whizzing around all over the place, along with your character randomly attacking whatever the game decides it should, make this an exercise in patience more than something fun to do. Even on sale, it's not worth it.  While there were a number of high profile names associated with this title, it is painfully obvious they were merely lounging while resting on their laurels as a handful of under skilled interns developed the game. Many cardinal sins were incorporated along the way, and while I really wanted to like the game, in the end just couldn't. If I wanted to pay money for this kind of frustration, I'd get back together with my ex.",0
"Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has the same pitfalls as most modern day RPGs. There is a massive player world with dozens and dozens of side quests, but the immersion factor is sorely missing. I ended up with the same problem I had when I played most of the Elder Scrolls series. My character became too powerful from pursuing all of the side quests, and nothing in the game was a challenge anymore. Add to that the fact that I reached a roadblock in the main quest which involved a dungeon that took more than five minutes to walk back through because of a missing item that I could not find, and there was not enough enjoyment here to keep me happy. The game seems more like work than play. It was very unenjoyable.   I put in over 40 hours, and I am done. I think my save is bugged, and I'm not willing to start over. Suffice it to say that I won't be completing this one. I can't recommend it for the same reasons that I can't recommend any of the Elder Scrolls games. It's too ambitious with no grounding. The story isn't interesting, and the levelling is lacks excitement. I give this one about a 3 on a 10 scale.",0
Get outta here.,0
"For most intents and purposes, this game feels very much like a Skyrim clone. Regardless, it did keep me entertained for a few weeks. IF you haven't played Skyrim, I would recommend playing that instead. If you need an RPG and are bored of anything Bethesda has out, then buy this to keep yourself entertained until a better game comes along. If you do play this, be sure to make multiple save files, like maybe one an hour. I have encountered several bugs that were very close to game-breaking(the Amalur wiki usually explains workarounds). Personally, I would have preferred another Bethesda(Elder Scrolls, Fallout series), or Bioware(Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights) game, but this game made nice filler until the next Dragon Age gets released.",0
"This is an alright game. The story is interesting and the mechanics are kind of fun. The game offers over 100 hours of adventuring fun. The skills allow you to fully customize your character into three different skill trees and get special bonuses depending on how you do it. You can also respec as many times as you like(with ample coin).  However, this game has some glaring problems. For one, the game is plagued by copious bugs. It is very frustrating to have to reload the game once or twice an hour because you get stuck in a loading screen, or stuck in the floor, or because the game just feels like randomly crashing. The game also has a strange and clunky cheap feeling to it. The cities are filled with guards who have strange psychic powers and can sense wrong doing from half a mile away. You're allowed to play good or evil and make choices in a Mass Effect like style. This is fun until you realize that your choices really don't matter much. You can go into a town and kill everyone, but that just means you killed a bunch of quest givers, so there really isn't a point. It feels like EA put a lot of effort into making the expansions and just left the bugs, because fixing bugs doesn't make money.  Overall this was an okay game and I recommend it if you'd like a nice time sink, can get it cheap, and can overlook the cheap design and buggy gameplay.",0
"It is painfully obvious that Kingdoms of Amalur was written as a console game. It is linear, handholding, simplistic, and devoid of inspired design. That it comes out of EA is no surprise either.  Graphics: 6/10  For a 2012 game, the graphics are mediocre. Bloom is used excessively outdoors to mask said mediocre graphics. Textures are not too bad, but there is a limited variety of them, giving a repetitive feeling to the game. There is a WoWish feeling to many of the graphics, which takes away a point for coat-tail riding... not to mention ugliness.  Sound: 6.75/10  Sound breakdown: ambient - 5, music - 6, voice acting - 9, game sounds (weapons, magic) - 7.  The ambience of a game, especially an RPG, is important. The sound ambience in KoA is rather bland and unmemorable. The music isnt much better, but not 'bad'. Game sounds are very... typical? Plain? The voice acting is quite good however. Essentially the whole voice cast of Dragon Age Origins has returned.  Gameplay: 2.65/10  Gameplay breakdown: Camera control - 0/10, quests - 2/10, combat - 4/10, magic - 4/10, NPC interactions - 5/10, environment interactions - 1/10, skill system - 3/10 ,crafting system - 2/10  There are several things that bring down this score for KoA for the PC, not the least of which is the **abysmal** camera design. Camera control is for all practical intents and purposes non-existent. You cannot even adjust the zoom distance! Coupled with the total lack of camera options, the cameras automated nature is atrociously programmed. Example: the moment combat begins, the camera immediately lowers its altitude from about neck level, to knee level.  Yes, it basically plants itself into the ground, and there is **nothing** you can do about it, except get out of combat by killing whatever is around you, or running away. Many times, you, the character, are actually removed from the screen entirely, and the camera points at nothing in particular!  I suspect this is because the camera is programmed to point at the 'center of gravity' so to speak, between and you mob of enemies. This becomes a major problem when say there are 4 enemies, and one of you, because the camera is going be pulled disproportionately towards the enemies position, but not all the way, so while pointing at the center of gravity of 5 equally weighted bodies, what you are left starring at is some random patch of grass or a rock wall.  Trust me... the camera is **BAD**, and it is a major stumbling block in attempting to have fun with this game. It just becomes more and more and more frustrating as you progress, and to my knowledge there is no fixing the cameras behavior.  The camera should never negatively impact gameplay... but KoAs does in a serious way.  On to other aspects of gameplay:   Quests were designed to be hand-holding baby quests. All the fun and adventure of QUESTING is completely removed, and quests in this game (and others) are not really quests at all. Quests are about discovery, mystery, intrigue, exploration, adventure, danger, etc.   What are called 'quests' in KoA are more like... boring. It basically comes down to, talk to NPC, follow your fully neurally integrated severely anachronistic GPS unit to the designated target, pick up and/or kill whatever, activate personal teleportation device to return to original NPC.  What do you even call that?  Combat is basically an exercise of stun locking. For those not aware, stun lock happens when it is possible to chain together multiple stun inducing attacks/effects back to back which have a recast/repeat/refresh interval that is less than the duration of the stun effect itself. Basically it means whoever hits first wins, no matter how much armor, HP, DPS, etc, anyone has.  Combat moves look flashy, explosive, bright, and fast, but somehow completely lack any feeling of depth. Its all superficial; for looks only, and it gets old, quick.  Magic is... tangential? I dunno... with the combat meta-game being solely about how you can stun lock your opponent (and its not difficult to split multiple opponents), magic isnt that much of a factor in anything. Spells are uninspired, and just meh in general.  NPC interaction: basically you can either talk to them, or kill them (or both). Lots of dialogue, which is good for immersion, but most of it feels irrelevant (all voiced very well though).  Environmental interaction: aside from opening doors... essentially none. Which is not acceptable for a game, especially an RPG game, circa 2012.  Skill system: There are 9 skills you can learn, each which have 10 levels. This is a low number of skills, but not in and of itself a bad thing. However, the skills themselves are uninspired, and are just... generic. You have your blacksmithing, your lock picking, your sagecrafting (gem/rune crafts that you stick into sockets), your persuassion, your stealth, etc. Its all very forgettable in the end; nothing stand out.  Also, you have a max of 40 levels to attain, and you start with 4 skills depending on your race, so youd think youd have a maximum of 44/90 skills, so youd better be careful what you choose, right?!  Nope.   You can actually get, without DLC, 89/90 skills. With DLC, all 90.  Stat system: There are no stats in KoA. Thats right. No strength, no dex, no wis or int, or anything.  Crafting system: Scrambling eggs is more complex than the crafting system in KoA (which I guess for the average console gamer, would put KoAs crafting system into the 'challenging' category).  Immersion: 2/10  It is painfully obvious that you are playing a game. From ridiculous weapon proportions, to the mysterious inability to jump, to the uncountably vast horde of invisible walls that restrict your movement, to the bizarre tendency for every single dungeon to be narrow passages that inevitably circle back to the entrance, the game world is not believable as a 'real' fantasy world that a person can lose themselves in.  Examples:   Weapons are of ludicrous size, which break immersion. Example: iron warhammer... youd think that at maximum, it might look like something like a 40 pound sledgehammer, which is a gigantic hammer that very few but the largest of large men could actually swing consistantly with power, and I mean actually swing, not just lift off the ground and bump it into things... well the iron warhammer in KoA, from what I can estimate, looks like its about 100 - 200 pounds in the handle, and 800 - 1000 pounds on the head... and a level 0 elf girl can swing it like its nothing. Literally, like it is not even there.  Invisible walls... everywhere.  No non-prescripted jumping.  Dungeons are circles.  Repetitive textures (although they are not of bad quality)... gives the feeling youre not actually going anywhere.  Linear progression of difficulty. Example: your first enemy outside of the starting dungeon is a bunch of wolves (how creative... because thats never been done before (better yet, your first enemy ever is a giant rat)). Those starting wolves are of the same size and build of every other wolf you will ever see in the game, and theyll all use the same tactics. But as you travel, the wolves in other parts of the world magically get stronger and stronger, and while they dont directly scale to your level, the designers did a pretty good job of approximating what level you would be when you reached a certain set of wolves and scaled their level accordingly to that approximation.  Basically it doesnt feel like you ever actually get more powerful.  Story: 4/10  Uninspired (that seems to be a theme KoA has going). Generic at best. Nothing in way of theme you havnt already heard before. Evil thing corrupts some king, king makes war, you are the risen messiah, go save the world as you are basically predetermined to do.    Final score: 4.28/10  I cannot recommend this game to any serious fan of RPGs who is on a PC.   You will be disappointed.",0
Won't load at going in to the Laboratory...,0
"This game is the final nail in the coffin for Electronic Arts games. After paying! for and downloading this game it is impossible to play without apparently altering my root menu. I uninstalled Origin after it became apparent that they would not let my use the Origin store to buy new games/dlc, but had hoped that EA games on Steam would be better. They are not. EA has shown repeatedly that they do not care about whether or not you can play their games, mearly that you give them money. They are single handedly killing the gaming industry and I, for one, would not be upset if the entire company went bankrupt, went to jail, or were to be killed horribly. In fact I would shake the hand of anyone that did. EA has stolen money from me for faulty products like the snake oil salesmen they are. I wash my hands of them.",0

"Looks and plays great, but something is lacking. Maybe it's what theologists call 'a soul'. Everytime I play i get bored.   If you need a good exploration based ARPG, play any Piranha Bytes game. Even Risen 2 or Gothic 3.",0
Just couldn't get into it. Felt like it borrowed shamelessly from a few games like Fable &amp; Elder Scrolls for example. I wanted a new experience and got a cocktail of old ones. Not for me.,0
"This game is pretty good. There is a lot to do, you feel like you are sort of making a difference, and the challenges grow with the character. Getting new gear is a treat as they are all visually more and more awesome. However, you need to save often! Not because you might die... lol... oh no... but because you might run into a game bug. So far I've found two and the second one actually disables fast travel entirely. The map in the game is big, but not too big, but the problem is just the annoyance of having to run everywhere. Then I found out when looking for a community to tell me how to get out of the bug, that the game studio apparently imploded. So, now I'm stuck, having to run around everywhere and the game is becoming more of an annoying grind than the fun questing adventure that I've been playing for hours. Big dissappointment and no chance of help. Get the game if you want, but read up on all the quest bugs first. You CAN get stuck. You CAN screw up the whole game. Gamer beware.",0

"A very boring rpg. Unless you have many free hours to kill, I recommend you stay away from this game. I was able to get 9 hours in before I made the decision to drop it for better games. Everything about the game was just too boring. The combat was super easy, the class system was average and the quests and story just didn’t have the right hook to get me interested.  The combat seems fun at first but then you quickly realize just how easy and frustrating it is. Enemies are generally dumb or cheesy. You can either face roll enemies or have no ability to dodge correctly, thanks to the wonderful camera and dodge system. You can try to dodge out of the way of an attack but occasionally the camera will be in such a spot that you instead dodge head first into the enemy, taking the damage and then some that you were trying to avoid. This happens more than enough to be frustrating. The quests and story is what truly killed this game for me. The beginning of the story is very bland and almost feels unoriginal. You come back to life after being dropped onto hundreds of decaying corpses to find out now that you have come back, you now have no fate and can change destinies. It seems like a cool concept but it’s surrounded by so many mediocre and cliché rpg elements that it drowns itself. I looked up the ending to the game to see if it redeems itself but let me tell you no, it does not. The story might have been more exciting if it wasn’t consumed by the hundreds of similar rpg quest tropes. Most of the quests turn into looking for a monster to kill, finding a missing person, and picking up items off the map or enemies.   I really wanted to like this game, I was excited for it when it came out but I held off on it hearing that it was just boring repetitive gameplay. Now that I was able to get it off Steam for cheap I have to say, they were right. Don’t bother playing this game. If you really have to though wait for a sale and make sure you have 20+ hours to dedicate to it.",0
"High production values are offset by a lack of overall depth.   Pros: Nice visuals, good voice acting, fun combat and a deep skill system that almost warrants a replay.  Cons: Mission structure is rarely more than 'run to location, fight enemies, collect item, backtrack'. It wears thin pretty quickly.   You can see where all of the individual influences have made their mark, but the end product is unremarkable due to 30-odd hours of repetitive and shallow missions. I'd recommend it, but not for $60.",0
Feels like an MMO both story- and contentwise. Combat is as boring as Fable.,0
Better than Skyrim.,0

The fighting is terrible.. the storyline from what I could read before my brain about died from it shows to be crap.. I literally saw no upsides to this game.. Don't waste your money.",0
Cheap Hooker of RPG's,0
"Stunning!  No, I mean that literally. Stunning. That's all there is. You stun them, they stun you, somebody dies. Usually you unless you play like a sissy.

"The best way to describe this game is like a 'super-sized' edition of the game FABLE. There is a similar feel but greater openess. While that sounds great, it isn't as great as it sounds. This is no Skyrim or TES game for example.   The biggest issue with this game that is overlooked by most reviewers, or that they keep mum about, is the 'cell'-shaped, 'inside a canyon' type feel of the game world. It's mostly a collection of large FPS-style levels. There is no grand, open-world that is seamless, like you would find in Gothic 3, Fallout 3/New Vegas, or Skryim, for example.  Instead, every areas is surrounded by a border of large hills and trees. You are confined to large sector. Similar to Neverwinter Nights. Or, imagine running around Un'Goro crater in World of Warcraft. Now imagine every other area and zone in World of Warcraft as the same design. The only way to get to one area from another was to run through a narrow canyon pass to the next canyon area. This at time is seemless in that there is no 'loading next level' pause for every area but for some areas, it does have to stop to load the area. Additionally, dungeons are instance-like, you enter and it loads the level. That's tolerable. As for the 'open game-world' canyon-running esque feel:  CRAP-LAME!  The other issue is that all the area look very similar to each other. Like NWN or WoW, they just have different colored fog/haze palettes to them and the aesthetic design doesn't seem to be all that different. Maybe some clown that worked on the game might want to argue 'well the tree-branches in confined zone A bend upwards whereas the ones in Zone B bend upwards at a lower angle by 2 degrees'. Whatever. If the game engine had limitations, it's not the gamer's fault it feels completely tacky.  What works in this game is the style of the characters, some of the decor, and art. The game itself has a very polished feel. But it also feels it is missing some key ingredients. It's like french-fries cooked really great, but missing the salt. It's like a juicy bacon burger without any sauce. It feels like the game engine is behind the times, and they tried to polish it as best they could, couldn't do it, so they continued the polish the utmost best to get it where it is. That would make sense, and I don't mind that, if for example, it would have majorily delayed the game to go all the way back and redo everything with a better engine.  Even though the graphics feel old, ARE old in various ways, the game sometime has performance issues for me. I run Skyrim with ridiculous detail but this game chugs at times. I can only surmise there wasn't enough time for optimization or in their efforts to polish it, as-if they had added glitz never originally intended for this game engine and it didn't work out. I can only surmise.  Lastly, a lot of the levels are flat with minor bumps and the occasional low-level cliffs. There is a big lack of vegetation making you feel as if you are running across a green carpet, like old school 3D games. This is no Gothic 3 that is uber-detailed with every nook and crany or like Skryim.  PROS: Great combat, combos, weapons, the graphic effects really accentuate this well. Great interaction with the NPCs, excellent polish. On the level with other RPGs like Gothic 3, for example or Skyrim. Lots of varied NPCs, craploads of unique side-quests. Good voice-acting. Tremedous background story and well fleshed out prose to articulate and act as the backbone for the game world. Comfortable 'talent-tree' type system. The characters all look like super-models. Not some 'rolls in the mud with pigs' looking characters like in Skryim. The assassin elf chick looks hot. You can opt to take a dark path. You can also opt to just slaughter all the annoying NPCs. The varied skills/powers is a huge plus, which adds depth to the gameplay. Excellent production values despite the 'behind the times' feel of the game engine. Engaging crafting system. Overall non-linear RPG, not to be overlooked if you like non-linear RPGs. Did I mention how polished it is? Completely lacks personality, although you can see areas where they really tried. For this, I put this in the PRO section because some people might find this was a WIN more than I did. The Fast-Travel system alleviates some of the 'run endless through the narrow canyon pass to next canyon/crater' feel. You can own your own homes. Lots of varied loot.  CONS: The EA/DRM system is a complete joke and useless. This alone is a sufficient reason not to buy the game. EA and Ubisoft have abominable system like this and don't deserve our $$$. You can buy great games (better games) from other companies that don't try to buttslam or inconvenience gamers with these NSA-style data collection scams. The story is totally boring. I really didn't give a crap about what was going on. The varied NPCs are very boring. Camera system is lacking. Super-Boring. Too restrictive in ways simliar to how FABLE was restrictive. Game needed some kind of 'edge', like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, drinking, some gore, etc. or just some kind of 'dark' element to better flesh it out. It felt too sanitized given the plot and darkness of some of the quests. You never felt anything about it. Example: Kill evil witch. OR: kill village she hates. You kill the village. Witch is pretty much like: 'OH, OK, that's nice. Here's a bit of gold.' You: 'OH, OK. Thanks.' Witch: 'Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, well, ummm. Buh-bye!' You: 'Yeah.' Game is like: 'Whatever.'  The canyon-esque zones are monotonous and utterly boring. I don't know, it was just so boring and un-engaging, that I just skipped through all the useless dialogue.  I actually found some battles to be hard.  The weapon system is grossly unbalanced, you will easily progress through quests to areas where there are no sufficient weapons to deal with the stronger enemies even in those areas. Imagine playing Skyrim to the very end with only Iron and Steel level items, with no Daedric or Ebony. You get to the point where even with epic items it takes like 7 hits to kill a remedial giant spider. Pretty fricken dumb if you ask me. This also ties to the problem with 'Classes'. There are three boring, generic choices: fighter dude, magic dude, rogue-dude, or hybrid. You will mostly like go with hybrid because being solid-fighter, solid magic dude, or rogue, whatever, is totally useless and underpowered. To adequetly survive, you must pick and choose from each. Hands down. No argument unless you want to waste your time trying to prove a point you know is already insipidly stupid. At times, if felt like Crusader of Might and Magic, running endlessly from one 'canyon' to the next.  The dispel-unlock system is a laughly broken piece of tird.  Ultimately, I liked the game gave choices and had lots of bells and whistles. The bland, boring environments and story, underpowered/unbalanced weapons/magic/talent system were huge disappointments. The world design was an epic let-down. Still, if you really enjoyed FABLE, you will really like this game. If you wanted FABLE but bigger, more stuff, more world, but ok with less character, less creativity, and boring story, then give this one a go. For any open-world RPG fan, I actually recommend it. Especially if it is on sale. I almost thumbed-up this game but couldn't in good conscience do that.  But man, is this game fricken boring! I fall asleep about 50% of the time I'm playing it. It tries to be perfect but it fails because it tries to be everything and it can't. It's like the Patrick Bateman of RPG games. There is an idea there, 'a kind of abstraction'. All the right pieces are there in order so that it fits in perfectly with all other RPGs of the genre it tries to win at, but behind the superficial front, it is souless.",0
A big pile of stolen parts from more succesful games tied together with lackluster writing.,0
"The story was pretty good. Game tried to be like Dragon Age: Origins. I just gave up on it, bored me.",0
"First off this is not a bad game, even still i wouldnt recommend going through it because it is just painfully average. If you expect some epic rpg then no this is not quite it, if you want some easy hack and slash game then yeah this might be it. What bugged me the most, speaking of bugs this game has very little of it, is the quests are just boring as hell and even though there is a lot of background story to discover but it just seems to matter so god damn little. Fighting is pretty cool though i would have liked to see a more diverse skill system or some sort of diversity that is not in the game. Also i finished the game and didnt even get my top sorcery card which means i probably didnt do enough side quests, but heck they are boring as hell. LOTS of walking during quests and in between makes it a bit stupid at times as well. Yeah so my final verdict is don't go with this game if you expect the next skyrim or some epic rpg.",0
KoA world is so boring and uninteresting. So many side missions to do but you couldnt care less,0

Fun game for the level or so I could play it. A couple hours into it I'm getting weird bugs where buildings render only half the time and the quests don't show up on the map anymore. I'd get a refund if I hadn't bought the game so long ago. It's unplayable.,0
"It was too late for a refund when I realized it's a repetitive game with no detail work at all. It's very casual if you ask me(no one asks me but you know). There are much better games of this genre, I suggest you stay away from this one.",0

"i guess once you get to a certain point the game just starts crashing, when you get to a loading screen it just keeps loading. i let it do that for 2 hours and nothing changed it said it was still loading so i restarted the game and then it wouldn't load",0
"The game itself is not half bad. it feels a bit old, and integrating it with EA's Orgin is a hassle. But that is not much of an issue to throw away the appeal of the game. However, The reason I gave this game a bad score is because I bought it with the DLC bundle without checking what the DLCs actually are (Can you blame me? it was on a summer sale). And one of the DLCs is a weapons and armour pack. It gave me overpowered weapons and armour for every class at the start of the game. That ruind the whole eperiance for me.",0

Can't get the game to run. 10/10 would uninstall again.,0
Nope. Bad combat. Bad menus. Bad cameras. Bad storytelling. I've put over 300 hours in the Wticher series and this game broke me after 3. The story is basically told by every NPC giving you novel-length exposition that is impossible to care about. Every character name is made with a 'create-a-fantasy-character generator'. Here's a name I just made up: Yalprelth. I bet it exists in this ♥♥♥♥ing game because every other horrible name does. Does my character have a name? At this point I don't even know or care. It's such a boring game and I don't understand why there are so many positive reviews.,0
"Basically add Fable 3, Skyrim, the Witcher, terrible graphics, and the worst graphics for a big budget title and you'll get this garbage.  Verdict: PASS",0
An MMORPG turned into a singleplayer game.   Horrible.,0
"This game features the following: - A clunky menu - Graphics that were outdated two decades ago - A horrible camera in combat (did the developers EVER play a game?) - Lifeless, dull characters I couldn't care less about - Game design and controls from the mid 90s. The character moves so freakin fast it's ridiculous. And dodging an attack makes the charakter dodge for at least five meters. What were they thinking? - Boring gameplay, in the first 30 minutes you're getting bombarded with cutscenes, pre-rendered cutscenes, text to read, yada here, yada there. This is an open world game I heard. Well, I was extremely annoyed by all the interruptions from NPCs or cutscenes. - All the four races you can chose from share the exact same model, only the skin differs. Now that's really some effort they put in the game. - And so on and so on. I only played it for about half an hour and already was so bored I couldn't progress.  Problem probably is, I do like ES:Oblivion, ES:Skyrim, Witcher 3 and the new Tomb Raider.  After playing this games this game here is beyond playability. I will refund this game.",0

Your eyes will water and gleam with delight as upon your screen plays out visuals the likes of which early World of Warcraft could only aspire to possess (and probably achieved by Burning Crusade, I don't know, uncle Nax never got hooked on that WoW stuff, no siree). Your soft, gooey, colorful character springs out of a mound of corpses like some necrotic phoenix, ready to bop, slash, level, traverse custcene wheels (thanks, Mass Effect), and slog through menus as the RPG gods intended. Your Oblivion-playing friends are gonna be so jealous!  From simply turning your camera to navigating your inventory (and I get the feeling you'll be doing both of these things a lot), everything is designed with a controller in mind. Wanna grab that loot on the ground? F to interact, but left click 'take all' or no dice. Pop open your inventory with the I key, then click around to get to your gear submenus. Wanna don that sword? Better left click then push enter, or right click and choose 'equip.' Just clicking stuff won't do, that's too complicated!   Walk with me now, back, back. We'll step into an era with invisible walls and tight corridors, to keep the player engaged and never you mind that wooden slope that clips into the rocks and which is inexplicably uncrossable. You'll pull a lever which dumps a corpse into an incinerator, which will then thump endlessly in there until you walk away. Why's it there? Immersion! Will you see something like this again? Nope!  Walk with me, walk further back. Further back? Yes, brave reader, we're braving the nineties and before! From the first few glimpses of action, we are beset by features etched far into the history of games and television alike!  Stock sounds!  Marvel, as the giant rats you encounter make -that one pig squealing sound- that you've heard a thousand times before! Behold, as the magic IEDs the immortal elves plant on some pillars explode with -that explosion sound- that you've heard from 1994 Doom's rocket launcher! Truly, we are living in the future.  We go any further back, and Uncle Naxza's gonna have to get unborn, so we'll stop here.  To put it simply, Amalur looks and acts dated from the word 'go.' It's an obvious, poorly-done PC port of a game made combining just about every generic RPG gameplay element of the past ten years, taking strong inspiration from modern MMOs and Bethesda titles. Areas are linear (even after you get out of the tutorial location) and lack any immediate distinction. You are pretty much 'the chosen one' living out your power fantasy of ripping up bandits and glorks and whatever else as you walk from idle NPC to idle NPC, waiting with punctuation marks above their heads for some brave hero to solve whatever ailment. The enemy AI is trifling (take four guys that stare at you and bob around while one of them winds up an attack, or bum rush the guy ahead of you while he makes threatening gestures for eight seconds), which makes even 'hard' difficulty feel like 'laughable' difficulty if you've ever played an RPG before.   And then there's the stock sounds. Call me a stickler for soundwork (and the music seems okay, if you excuse the predictably percussive battle drum music), but I lose faith in a title very quickly when it starts using stock sounds. I don't know, it's lazy. We've heard these sounds before, and if you're trying to make something new, or different, or stand out, using sounds that we've all heard before isn't the way to do it! I'm sure soundwork is expensive, and you don't need unique sounds for every facet of a game, but I don't know, maybe the sounds that don't feature in every cheap action flick/TV drama.  Harsh? Yeah. Premature? Maybe a little, I only have an hour and a half playtime at this point. First impression? Strongly made. Not good.  Buy the game? No. Buy the game on sale? Maybe if you're out of other RPGs to play (is that possible?) or you've never really played a third person RPG before.",0
had it on consol and was not a fan.,0
I honestly don't understand the fandom for this game.  This game doesn't look that great. This game has a massive and empty world which gets boring quickly. This game's combat system is shallow and overhyped.  Personal opinion: 2/10,0
Feels like just another MMO. 10/10 - IGN,0
"Kind of cute, but just too silly to be taken seriously. A failed attempt at an MMO whose studio's collapse is a matter of public record.  Sad.",0
"The FOV is total ♥♥♥♥. It's so close to the character that you cant see whats going on around you. THERE IS NO WAY TO ZOOM&lt; NONE AT ALL. Fighting 5 things at once? Good luck, you can only see two of them at a time. Windows Widescreen fixer is a joke, doesn't work and hasnt been updated in 2 years. Also tried 'flawless widescreen fixer' Acutally made the FOV closer..I nearly threw my monitor acrooss the room. There aren't any helpful forums and the few that are there are from 2012.   The most disapointing part...it would have been an amazing game if the FOV wasn't so ♥♥♥♥ing close. I just couldnt get past it. Ruined it. Luckily with the sale i only paid $5 because it's worth about that much if not less.  UNPLAYABLE.",0
"Remember Fable? This is basically a dumber Fable. R.A. Salvatore, as a pal recently put it, is the 'Dean Koontz of fantasy.' My god the writing in this is trash. I could forgive this since you are able to skip all of the stupid conversations about Tolkein and magic Elf wizards and whatever, but the gameplay is extremely shallow. There's like nothing to do except wander around, mash buttons, and be bored at everything.    If you're like 12-years-old or an idiot, you might like it. Otherwise don't even get this boring piece of ♥♥♥♥ on sale. There are far better rpgs out there.  Seriously though, R.A. Salvatore is a complete hack and this game is like a single player WoW. So. So. Bad.",0
"completely worthless. combat is a joke. mash 1 button over and over, and decimate every nemy you ever run into. there is no difficulty, the graphics look like fable 1 quality, the dialog is forced and badly written, and the voice acting is in general complete ♥♥♥♥. quicktime events pop up left and right. if this game is on sale for 0.99$ then buy it, otherwis dont bother.",0
Not enough dickwolves.,0
shamless knock off of dragon's dogma,0
Played a few minutes and got horribly bored . ♥♥♥♥ game,0
this game is not fun or interesting. it's unfortunate .,0
"This game was so freaking boring. Wish I never bought it, even for $10.",0
i was playing this and the first boss i fought i couldnt even finish him. it told me to push F but it wouldnt work. can i get a ♥♥♥♥ing refund or something . its like when you buy a game you exspect it to work longer then 20 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes. fix this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t already. Whoevers job it is should be fired because there doing a piece of ♥♥♥♥ job.,0
"If you get the collection with all the DLC and such, be aware that the Weapons and armor bundle is 100% worthless. That DLC give you weapons/armor at the level of the first character you play. So it all spawns at level 1 and is ineffective by level 5-10.   The game has the least interesting story possible, you don't need to read anything. I honestly don't know what the game is even getting at and I am pretty far in I think.   I feel compelled to finish the game just because I have invested so much time already.  The fighting is ok, nothing to write home about.  I struggle with whether or not to recommend this, but I am going NO simply because it is an MMORPG, without the MMO. (So it is just an RPG? No, seriously, if you've played an MMORPG like wow where it is like 'Go here get this come back' it is identical to that)",0
Not even worth the 4.99 i paided for it when on sale. It's a pile of sterotypes and cliches in a mishmash yet some how boreing pile.,0
"Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning starts of as a fun to play RPG with some nice features but lacks the quality that most RPG's have.  The stealth in this game is very unneccesary. Although a stealth kill looks cool, it's just way faster to run and slash your way through.   Having said that, the next big issiue with this game is it's difficulty. Or better said the lack of it. This game is incredibly easy. I started off at normal difficulty, but I cranked it up to the hardest really fast. Even then you can take a few hits from the bigger mobs without dieing. Even though these hits are really easy to dodge.  As you can see I played this game for a few hours and I can recommend it too anyone who considers hisself/herself as a casual gamer, but for the hardcore gamers among us this game is just too easy. The fun started to flow away after 20 hours. I've been trying some other builds to see if it was any better, but without any luck.  I'm not recommending this. Keep playing Skyrim will be my advice.",0
Aagh! Why does EA require an email and login just to play this game I bought!! This is an atrocity.,0
"This game is not worth your money. It is poorly balanced and it's more up to luck than skill wether or not you will become a wet stain on the ground. Combined with a louse save system this adds up to a lot of frustration. The idea of the game is good, and I do like the way you can specialize in several schools (mage, warrior and rogue) and pick skills from all three schools. But it's poorly implemented into the gameplay.",0
An OK action RPG. The begining of the game is actualy very enjoyable but the game soon becomes flat and dull with too much generic filler content and a lack of variation in the combat. ,0
"It's fun for a while, but it gets powerfully repetitive. It just becomes the same thing over and over as the game goes on. It's pretty, but in an 'MMO' sort of way, where every model just comes in different colors, and divided up into zones with one or two distincitve features. It feels like a really well done single-player mod for an MMO. It's not bad, but I've tried four times to finish it, and I get bored every time.",0
It has a huge bug that does not allow you to complete the game. This bug is well known but has not been fixed. Keep that in mind if you purchase this game!,0
"Repetetive and Boring.  For me, the story could grip me in the demo, but it takes quite a while to reach the next point of the main story and on top of that, the side quests are boring. The fighting system doesn't get much verity in fighting, just be houdlum and smash everything.  Everything just takes ages to achive and is boring at that.",0
"Many hours of gaming to be had here but much of the quests are fetch type and boring. The main quests along with faction are ok. Sometimes the camera angle is quite bad in combat but this happens rarely. Id say if you can pick this one up at a low price then its worth it. There are many, many quests in this game.",0
"I really wanted to like this game but I just couldn't.  The problem is that it's really generic. It doesn't really offer anything memorable at all. While I suppose whatever or not  you  will enjoy it remains the quetion. But after trying my best at getting into the story I just really can't see much of value.  To sum up my personal experience:   Bland story   Bland characters   Tedious and boring combat after a while   Generic abilites/skills   Generic items and equipment    There is a chance you will like it more than i did.  And if you really are into single player RPGs you might actually like it. But i personally felt like the game fell short of what could have been, and compared to other RPGs it's not that much it offers.",0
"If for whatever reason someone out there would like to play a MMORPG, but without the 'multiplayer' and 'online', this is the game for you.  Also the field of view is balls.",0
"Starts off strong but quickly loses its allure. The combat is fun and unique at first, but the inability to switch weapons mid-combo removes absolutely any level of depth. The combat wants to be Devil May Cry, but it's like they forgot to finish programming the combat half-way through.   The characters are entirely unlikeable, and the game tries to force-feed you lore through them at any moment that it possibly can. The story's forgettable, especially when you stop and think, 'Why am I helping these people again? I don't like them.'  The world is technically 'open', but the leveled mobs may as well make it entirely linear on that front. As well, there's really no point in the world being open, since past the vistas that they front-load into every new area, the world feels completely dead and drab.   The game also lacks a deal good deal of polish in certain areas. As an example, if you're using a ranged weapon and fighting an enemy who is uphill from you, you will attack the ground in front of you instead of attacking towards the enemy that you're targeting. Often, when this happens, your attacks will fly through the ground and clip out of bounds until the animation finishes.   Ultimately, Kingdoms of Amalur, falls short everywhere that it had potential to shine. If you can get it cheap(and I mean really cheap) and you're willing to overlook a good deal of flaws, it may be worth your time.",0
Was this game supposed to have excellent narrative from some impressive famous author? The first hour or so of dialogue is one of the most stupid things I've ever seen in a professionally made computer RPG.,0
"I liked the game in the beginning, but I started to hate it over time.  The game feels like an uninspired mmo. The talent tree is very bad. You have to walk a lot, back and forth, like, there is a quest that have a locked gate and to open, you need to deactivate 4 things in the map, and this things are very very spread across the map. Some quest you have to traverse the world just to talk with a npc, and them it sends you to another far far point of the world just to talk to another npc. A lot of the map dont even have enemies, and when it does, its the same enemy variety. Some skills take time to cast, like 4 seconds, and are interrupt when you get hit, this inside an action based combat that is like god of war, so, guess if this is frustating or not. The voice acting seens ok, the history is ok too. The combat is functional but there is some problems, is awkward to dodge, the actions are queue when you press the button, making the combat feel unresponsible some times, dodging is a pain in the a**, you have pretty much to do it preemptively, also the skill and abilities are lacking, and the magics does not scale with the attack of your weapon, my staff was very powerful and my normal attacks done more damage then my main spell, making it useless. Also the inventory system is very bad, you have to backtrack to a city to sell some things, over and over again, and there are not many npcs that buy things in the map, you have to travel to specific cities, so if you are in a quest, you have to destroy your excess items or backtrack a lot just to sell some things in a far city.  They had the tech needed to make an awesome game, but they failed in every important aspect of the game design.   I was very excited for this game, but sadly I didint liked it. For a cheap price you can have some fun, but ultimatelly I don't recomend at all.",0
"---World The game world feels small, but there's plenty of side quests for people like me who shun main quests in RPGs. Despite all the action, the game is heavily lore-based. Amalur is a side quest lover's fantasy. It is a shame that the story is not particularly worth paying attention to.  ---Gameplay Save often (every 30 seconds or so) because the controls are clunky. If you see an attack coming, but the PC is already performing an action, good luck trying to cast cancel.   The fact that all mobs spawn in groups means that if you get hit once, chances are you'll become stun-locked. Hard difficulty may be easy for might and magic builds, but provide plenty of death knells for finesse/stealth builds. The stealth system is essentially broken. If you're in stealth mode, enemies are essentially deaf and blind as long as you aren't in their narrow FOV. Even so, if you fail to kill a mob with one stealth backstab, they tend to turn around and instantly take out a chunk of your HP. The worst part is, such backstabs do negligible damage to those mobs. The worst mobs to face are magic based. Enemy magic spells are particularly difficult to dodge since most lock on to your position. It is impossible to select which enemy to attack, which is often problematic. The worst in when Reckoning mode is activated and the player character keeps swinging at an enemy that is already down. Note that my play style always involves a lot of kiting and an extreme aversion to using potions. I suspect that the game is easy even on hard if you have a build with a ton of HP.  The camera angles are shoddy. In combat, you sometimes cannot see what is happening if you are stuck near a wall. Often I run in the wrong direction because the camera pans awkwardly or because I cannot see what is behind me (the camera locks onto enemies during combat).  There is no way to toggle always running despite the fact that there is no fatigue bar. This makes it difficult to put some distance between the PC and mobs when you're trying to kite. You have to start jogging and then mash the run key, hoping that your PC will eventually start running.   The invisible walls everywhere get really annoying quickly. If you get a destiny card that replaces dodge with blink, save often. There is no console, so if you blink and get stuck you will have to reload.  The best part of the game is that you can respec at just about any time as long as you have the money. It is really easy to make money in Amalur.  ---Visuals Amalur's brightness and overexposure lends to vivid scenery and a cartoony feel. It's jarring enough that you might want to consider using an ENB/SweetFX injector.  ---Audio The music is not very memorable or particularly immersive, but at least it does not play continuously. It follows the Elder Scrolls school of musical cues so you'll know when combat starts and ends if you have the music turned on.    ---Final Thoughts I wish more RPGs had a similar combat system, but with less delay between input and action. Amalur has some good ideas, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.",0
" Pros  Interesting story and awesome finishing moves (I love the finishing move for gnomes). Beautiful graphics. Fast travel system is nice.   Cons  Level design is plain and boring. Every landscape is bare and open and you spend most of the time just running and fighting. There are some nice spots, but the excess space between them makes it feel like forced landscape. Later in the game, detail is stuffed in so small spaces that akward camera system is blocked with all the details on the screen.  Camera system is really akward. It tries to keep all enemies on the screen, which may or may not help the player. Finishing moves will be executed partly outside of camera's view, unless you fight one enemy or enemies are tightly packed together.  Extra story elements that you may ask from NPC don't really add anything. You can't receive extra missions through them or point of intrests. After 30 minutes of game play, I just skipped everything and focused on the main quest.  'Ambush' camera close-ups are waaayy too regular. Every troll/(tribal)demon you meet will get its own 'OMG! LOOK AT THIS MONSTER AT CLOSE RANGE!'-close-up.   Other  I didn't really use crafting system. I created some potions and crafted few items, but it was waste of time because you find better loot from monsters. You can also upgrade items with gems, but that is also waste of time because all the good loot you get from the monsters.   Summary  Interesting story, boring level design, akward camera. Buy it if you like from good story and don't care about running around and fighting every 15 seconds.",0
"Starts out fun, and seems quite promising. However quickly becomes tedious and boring, making it difficult to find reasons to continue playing. Combat is overly flashy, and has very little substance to it.",0
Having STUPID sound issued and not a single way of fixng I can't recommend this game...  I thought this kind of issued had been solved but nope...   ,0
"It is possible to change the play styles you use so it wont become boring too fast but I feel this was the only thing that allowed me to continue playing. It is not very user friendly because majority of the times when completing a dungeon you would have to run back to the beginning yourself and shortcuts were rare, though it is not a problem it is time consuming. I also do not feel that the levelling system was well balanced because as soon as you get the hang of the controls it gets easy real fast, even if you are playing on hard difficulty. It was not very rich in story either. I found it to be a very generic, something you can find in any RPG and doesnt really make it stand out. The fateshift feature is pretty much a berserk mode, which is very overpowered and very easy to fill up. Not only are you overpowered on your own it also alows you to use potions to temporarily increase your stats during combat and also permanent boosts known as twist of fate. To summarise it is a very generic RPG game.",0
"Everything about this game is just pretty bland, I stopped paying attention to the plot after a half hour, which is really sad for an RPG. itemization is poor, I spent 7 of the 10 hours played using the same weapon, which was a 'green' quality weapon which for some reason was better than some blue or purple weapons I found. The music was forgettable, as were the characters that I ran into, the world, and the writting/dialouge.   The combat isn't bad, but it lacks a lot of options you would normally expect to find in games like this. You have a melee/range attack button and a magic attack button and that's about it, melee combos act the same nearly every time with the same weapon and in the first 10 hours there were 3 attack spells, 1 of which was worth using. There are some other melee abilities if you invest in them, but they never appeared to be any better than just using a normal 3 hit standard melee combo.   This is essentially a single player MMO, with a more active combat system but without a lot of the things you expect from MMOs, but at least there's a lot of quests and a bit of grinding, so if you're into that, this game will give you some good play time but otherwise I can't recommend this.",0
"Awesome design, interesting storyline. However, after a couple hours the game get's way to easy with no real challenge even on the highest difficulty and it can get boring very fast. Never got to complete it, it's worth too much for a game like this.",0
"interesting combat for a few hours, but then it gets repetitve. Some reviews have compared it with God of War-esque combat, and i got fooled. But i don't play RPG's strictly for combat so which brings to the next point.  Quests are just uninteresting, I couldn't care enough to finish the game. It felt like a chore... it's shame, but because it seems like a lot effort when into this game.  ",0
"The game didn't age well. It could've been a good game to play when it was released, but nowadays it's ugly, it's repetitive and the story, even though it has it's upsides, isn't appealing enough, in my honest opinion. I feel that I lost money by buying this game that there were so many people saying that could rival Skyrim.  A little disapointing.",0
"THe game has an interesting combat system and would acutally be fun ... if it was not completely overloaded with sidequests to the point where I simply gave up because I felt so swamped that I had no fun playing anymore.  A linear questline with some sidequests is fine, I even love a ton of sidequests as long as they are structured in any way but as it is here you pretty much can get a quest from every second npc wandering around. They should have put those gazilion quests onto a notice board or something so you can pick those single quests all at once. Also the quest-tracker needs to be a lot better in a game with this many quests. Maybe creating chains would also help instead of single 1-3 step missions.  I bought this game on sale, so not much money lost, still I regret the buy a bit.  In the end, do not get me wrong this can be a very nice game, the combat is interesting, I like the style and it has a lot of audio content (pretty much everything is spoken so there went a LOT of effort into this part of the game - even if some of the actors sound royally bored) ... BUT and this is a big but: this game is only for you if you have a massive amount of time and like running in circles to finish missions for days on end and do not get frustrated by overwhelming amounts of go-there-kill-that-come-back quests. If you are looking for a game that you can go up against for a really long time, pick this one up, if you like even a resemblence of structure (and I am not talking forced lineare gameplay, open world is fine as long as there is some structure that keeps you from getting totally lost) skip it.",0
"I picked up Kingdoms of Amalur with high hopes from the reviews and screenshots. It looked pretty and promised things like an open world, a well written interesting story, and dynamic combat. Sadly, it was bland and left me with a bad taste as it failed to deliver on many of those promises.   Impressions",0
"How would I sum this game up ? Mediocrity at it's best. I mean the game is fine, it has all the necessary things for an action RPG, but the thing is you never get lost in it, the game doesn't suck you in as other games in this genre do. I just didn't feel that pull to return to the game, to find out what happens next.  I've played a few action RPGs - Mass Effect 1-3, Witcher 1,2, Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, TES: Oblivion, Skyrim and all of them made a much better impression on me.  The strange part is I can't actually point to one single thing that is wrong or broken in this game. I said it in the beginning - it's an ok game. But maybe that's it's downfall - it's just ok, it's kind of bland, nothing that stands out. It ticks all of the boxes for an RPG but never excels in any of them.  It's a forgetible experience for me and I jumped to other games very quickly. Compare that to my 100+ hours in each of the Fallout games and you can see the difference.  So would I recommend this game ? Well it depends. If you're a seasoned RPG player, then I'd say skip this game. It just doesn't have anything to offer that you haven't already experienced in other games in this genre. If you the type that absolutely has to play all RPGs out there, consider this game only if it is on sale. Now, for someona who is only starting his adventure with RPGs, I think this game might be a good starting point. It has all the basic mechanics in it, it will introduce you to the concept of open world games and it will only get better once you move on to other, better titles.  I myself might pick it back up some time down the road, or maybe not. Right now there are more fun games in my catalog waiting to be palyed.",0
"This game represents everything that is mediocre. It's fun for a few hours, but after that you have seen eveything. I really had to force myself to finish this game.",0

"A game made from the dream of a baseball player who loved World of Warcraft so much he wanted to make an MMO that was better. He failed, barely getting the game out before losing the whole company. This game is the last ditch effort of the only game the company made to at least have their product played. That said, it feels like a MMO that no one else is playing, tons of loot handed to you as if you were intended to share it, large environments to run around in by yourself, etc. I didnt like it, which is sad that peoples lives were ruined over this game. It would have been a cool MMO.",0
"What we have here is a game about an unlikely hero with a semi-interesting plot set in a kitchen sink fantasy world. It's basically an R. A. Salvatore fantasy novel equivalent of a Role Playing Game, in the sense that it's really pointless to suffer through unless you are a fan of the genre with more free time than it would take to experience all the better offerings out there. Why? Well, for starters Kingdoms of Amalur is basically a single player WOW clone. This isn't a bad thing by itself, and it might even be a selling point for many (and I thought it would be for me). However, it really doesn't work. First, there is a limit to how many fetch quests and kill quests and how much stupid narrative you really can suffer through by yourself before it all starts feeling like a drag. Second, the world, while immense, also feels like a desolated patchwork of ideas that just never comes together the way WOW's world does. And lastly, the game's mechanics just don't come together well, leaving you with a lot of trap build options and over-performing weapons/builds. I haven't sunk enough hours in to finish the game (my guess is that I'm probably at around 25% mark so far), but what I've played so far really doesn't make me want to go back for more. Uninstalled, and not recommended.",0
I regret for buying this game :/,0
Boring. The fighting is boring.,0
"Tips for noobs:  ~ Skills ~ -Alchemy, lockpicking, persuasion, and stealth are useless skills. -Up to 5 levels of each skill can be found or bought in the game (6 with DLC). -Detect hidden should be invested in immediatly. I've found Purples and Yellows in hidden chests. -Blacksmithing is incredibly OP. -Fateweavers reset all skills. Use this to maximize your training potential (You can be too overleveled in a skill to train it) -Mercantile is excellent for early game. Once you have 2mil+ gold, reallocate those points to something worthwhile.   ~ Combat ~  -Bows with the 7 charged shot ability can one shot bosses when fired at close range.  -Invest early in +health/second gear. This keeps you from overusing health pots.  -Weapon damage stats may be misleading. A Dagger with 30 phys and 30 piercing will read 60 damage. Another dagger with 20 Phys, 20 Piercing and 20 poison/5 seconds will also read as 60 damage. -Use Reckoning often; it's quick to recharge. Combine with experience potions for exponentially more exp.   ~ Misc ~ -Quests are black and white regarding moral choices. These have little repercussions. -You will outlevel the available gear considerably. -Many zones and quests will be skipped. -NEVER repair via a blacksmith. Always use repair kits, it's astronomically cheaper this way (even with 0 Blacksmithing skill) -Explore early. This aids greatly when fast traveling from redundant quest to redundant quest.  -You can buy back EVERYTHING you've ever sold in the game. Only sell to the Fence in Star's Camp. That way you can buyback anything you want (even if you stole it) if you choose to respec.",0
"Very well made game for what you get. To me the world does not feel alive. Fighting on the game was the worst part of the game but also the biggest part of the game, whenever you attack and your attack is enterupted you basically have to wait for your charactor to recover and for the enemy to stop beating you. The game on a scale of 1 to 10 is a 5, it is not for everyone and i would not have continued to play if i hadnt paid my hard earned money for it.",0
Unimaginative and often constricting gameplay got in the way of my interest in the world and the story. After a little over 20 hours of completionist-style play I felt like progress was a chore and just stopped playing. Plus the still-present minor technical issues didn't help either.  Full review here:  http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2015/09/kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning.html ,0
"I'd advice people not to buy this game. It's just not up to par at all with other RPGs.  It feels like everything's just a shell... I've played F2P MMO's with much more oomf to hitting things and doing things.  Games like these would REALLY need the combat to make you feel awesome, but here it feels kinda bland and superficial. Your hits don't feel like they're doing much. ",0
This game had so much potential but there's something a bit off about it. I still can't point it out yet but it's a good RPG to waste 10 or 20 hours with but still I wouldn't recommend it.  Pros - Skill system is just pure AWESOME!  - Great crafting system - Combat is quite enjoyable  Cons - Voice acting. Try it and you'll see. Not bad and not good either. Maybe and just maybe this is the one that is really off in this game. - Story isn't really that interesting - Not immersive at all (I can literally kill a whole town and the next town wouldn't mind at all and tell you that's just one reason) - The monsters you'll be encountering are the same one except for the names from the start until the end of the game - Graphics (More of a personal taste)  I really just bought the game to show support on how this game could have been a ton better than it is now. I know the studio is gone and everything but We'll never know.,0
"Ugh. I really wanted to enjoy this one - creative and original game world, interesting lore, lots of quest variety - but holy hell is it tedius. Evocative of soul-crushing MMORPGs, there's just so much pointless ♥♥♥♥ to do in this game - you quickly become overwhelmed with quests, side-quests, mini-quests, areas, sub-areas...♥♥♥♥. No more. I'm done with games that have their map littered with icons and things to 'do.' If you enjoy running errands, you'll enjoy this one. If not, you may trick yourself.",0
"The Story:   I found out about this game after doing some late night googling on Salvatore. 20 years ago I started reading his books and was amazed that I completely missed the fact that he worked on a game and it immediately went on my wishlist. The main story was okay, I don't really have any complaints but I didn't really feel any Salvatore coming through and I am unmoved. Anyone could have written/helped write the world and I wouldn't know any difference.   The Art:   Simultaneously I found out Todd Mccfarlane had some play in the art and I have an entire box of Spawn comics. My favorite childhood artist and writer together for one game, holy ♥♥♥♥. The color is great in the game but the lack of detail is mind boggling. Todd put so much detail into spawn comics and seeing character models without fingernails was just disgraceful. The graphics and animations are rather plain and nothing here is an artistic achievement. At one cutscene I recall a female soldier being shot in the back with an arrow and I think they tried to animate blood coming out of her mouth but it just looked like it was pouring out her face. Mediocrity is the theme for the art.   The Gameplay:   Through and through this is a single-player MMO action rpg. You could take any free to play mmo, remove the multiplayer and nothing about this game would outshine any of the uncountable amounts of games in the genre. Pretty much each zone has a town, each town has npcs with exclamation marks giving out fetch and kill quests. Each zone is linked together by a passage. There are basic tradeskills with the classic WoW style herb gathering, jewelcrafting , blacksmithing (except the last two you get regeants from chests and not nodes) and you don't need to invest in any of them although healing potions are the end all-most powerful item in the game as you can just spam them like Diablo 1. The skilltrees are decent, on par with something like diablo 2. The combat is mediocre to bad for an action game but better than an RPG like Skyrim. The main storyline is about 12 hours long and 'literally' 70% of the time you will be walking from one point to another like a really bad mmo, 20% of the time you will sit in inconsequential conversations and 10% fighting. The final boss was terribly boring/uninspiring/unchallenging and the entirety of the game was not challenging except at one point my main quest enemies became red (as opposed to neutral level enemies that are yellow, just like any mmo) and they were mostly unkillable. I went back to the surface leveled twice off yellow monsters (the 'open world' monsters scale to your level) came back and walked through the rest of the game without even trying.   Verdict:  Theres a lot of game here.. You could put 200 hours into fetch and kill quests if you wanted to and you can respec your skills as much as you want. If you (like me) have a history of playing mmos and you have no desire to grind out fetch quests ever again for the rest of your life just avoid this less than mediocre ftp-single player-mmo action game. If you have never played an mmo, or you love fetch and kill quests this game is ripe with them for many many hours.",0

"Gameplay was alright, but hindered heavily by what seemed to be issues with the difficulty being stable and potions not having a cooldown.",0
"You could honestly mistake this game both graphically and the way they construct the world as a good rpg made 10 years ago. This doesnt mean that if you like old games youll like this, it just means that it overall is pretty uninteresting in every aspect and is not up to date with good world design.  EDIT: After reading some of the top positive reviews for this game, theres something I feel needs to be clarified about this game. If you have never played a good rpg before, this game is awesome. If basic RPG features wow you, then youll be amazed by this game. If you have played any other RPGs, this game is not for you.",0

Best regards. Gisli Einar",0
This game at least doesnt crash if you have the settings turned down. It is ok - not a ton of fun but something to pass the time. The real problem is that it is just slow to get to the action.,0
This is a truly horrible game. I tried to play it for a couple of days then uninstalled it.,0
Why did I buy this?,0
"I don't understand all the fuzz about this game. Bought it in a promotion with all DLCs for like 5bucks but even so it is not worth it. I had fun the first few levels but it got old very quickly. I finished all maps (including DLC) in nightmare+5skulls and the only feeling I have is that I wasted 30hours of my life. Most of the levels, namely on nightmare, are more a game of 'find-out-the-only-strategy-and-loadout-that-works-in-this-map-lol-screw-fun' than a real game. In a lot of maps there is only a winning strategy - not a balanced game for different types of playrs/loadouts.  If you want a tower defense / shooter hybrid get SANCTUM, not this pile of crap.",0
"I won this game in a bet, I'd wished I lost",0
"I feel bad killing those orcs, but then I remember, they were trying to kill me.",0
"No built in key bindings. Big convoluted mess to try to get the game working with your own key bindings. On top of that, you can't even have a controller or something your PC THINKS is a controller plugged in to make it work correctly. Not worth the time and effort when there's a ton of other games out there to play. If I hadn't gotten this in a bundle (not to mention hadn't spent over 2 hours of game time trying to get it to WORK), I'd refund the heck out of it. This should not be acceptable. I can't believe how many positive reviews this has. It boggles the mind.",0
"Mouse sensivity is a big problem for this game. Very hard to control the character and camera often. I did not find a satisfactory solution to keep mouse under control in the web. God luck for you. If you ignore this, it is a great game but almost unplayable for myself. I finished all levels.However, I do not recommed this game ...",0
"I had difficulty getting into this, especially after having playing Orcs Must Die 2 co-op with a friend. Many of the levels, it seems, require you to run back and forth between two different entrances. In co-op this works marvelously (10 of the original maps can be played in the second title in the series), as each player can hold an entrance, calling the other when things get hairy. The number of weapons and traps is also less than the second game. Perhaps this is an unfair criticism, but at the very least, perhaps this review will be helpful to others who are tempted to visit the first game after trying the sequel.",0
"It's an action Tower Defense game. You place traps then you help shooting monsters down before they reach the goal.  Buy the second one. Skip this one. The second even has most maps from this game, and has co-op which is missing here. Feels more like an incomplete and simple game.",0
"The lack of ability to respec or refund your upgrades really hurts the game. One of the most fun parts of games like this is experimenting with different strategies and different weapons, so the fact that you can't do this at all very much takes away from the fun.",0
"Don't get me wrong, it is a fun game, but I say it's inferior to the sequel. The lack of multiplayer is especially disappointing here. I wouldn't pick this up unless I've played through the sequel and still feel like I haven't had enough.",0
"Tower defence at its finest, intuitive gameplay and a lot of replay value. The only reason this is getting a negative review is because at this point you're better off buying the sequel OMD2. It has everything this game has and more.",0
"Orcs Must Die is at its core a tower defense game, but in 3D, with a below average FPS element. If you are a fan of tower defense games, I'm sure you'll get a lot of enjoyment out of the game, since there is a lot of content.  If you are a FPS gamer however, you'll probably get bored very quickly, as I did. Orcs Must Die was probably never intended to compare to 'real' FPS games, and as such, the combat, difficulty, and enemy diversity and adaptation is lacking when you compare it.  It's really annoying that you can only recommend a game, or not. If you are tower defense player, Orcs Must Die is amazing value. If you are an FPS gamer, Orcs Must Die is disappointing.",0
The game is uber fun but good luck getting it to work. On multiple machines it just starts to a black screen and shows a sword icon. Common issue and the game devs don't seem to care.,0
It's taken me 8 attempts but I'm finally about to beat this level with no enemies making it through the ri-  *game crash*  *uninstall*,0
Could be a great game if it was a mobile app. but it's not,0
"Gets boring waaaayyyy too quickly. Don't know why it has such a high score. Look, it's an interesting concept but just not worth it.",0
"I really want to love this game, but I cant.",0
It's fun until you realise it is just a regular horde game and you can't really combo the traps together very much. Just get the sequel.,0
"i dont know, but i didnt found something special in this game",0
It's a worse version of Sanctum with orcs.,0
"The control scheme is straight up awkward and I don't know what it was designed for, but I can tell you it wasn't meant for controller or kb and mouse. That alone ruins what would otherwise be an uninspired, repetitive tower defense third person action game.  There's much better out there.",0
Orcs must die!2 buy that one. Steer clear of this one. It`s so much inferior.,0
"Got old real quick, like most games of its kind. Pass.",0
"An okay tower defense game. Gets boring very quickly, but to be honest I really dislike the genre, hence why I might be prejudiced. If you like tower defenses, ignore my review, otherwise I recommend to pass on this one. It's just building traps and watching enemies walk into them and die. Sure, the game provides some challenge, but the gameplay itself is just setting up traps as quickly as possible and shooting some enemies from time to time.",0
Unplayable for me as performace is very very bad. Even the menus are slow and jerky although i can play OMD 2 no problem so not recommended. Get the follow up.,0
"this isnt a tower defance game, this is a hack and slash game with 2 weak weapons with an idiotic loud mouth duchbag charecter.  traps and defences are useles and weak, and too expensive to buy or update.  money is too low and hard to come by.  way to hard and repetative to eaven bother. and there is the occasional crashing.  nope.",0

Not fun.. When you start it's already hard without a turtorial only how to press buttons.. The game is too fast and i can't aim.,0
Very boring,0
Spent about an hour with it. Read how good it was in the reviews but this got way too old way too fast. Bought it on a sale so it wasn't that big of a deal for a dollar. I've spent more on worse.,0
I emailed Robot Entertainment to report a bug in the game because some creatures didn't die when they landed in lava. They simply said to buy the sequel because they didn't want to release any more bug fixes. Avoid like the plague.,0
"This is a great, really fun game. Do yourself a favor though and get Orcs Must Die 2. It has everything this game has (including most the maps) and a whole lot more.",0
That was a nice game but boring as hell. Sequel is much better.,0
"Yet again, this is NOT a recommendation. More like a warning to steer clear and spend your money elsewhere on more worthy titles.  The game has some very nice video's that hype the game up to levels if completely fails to reach when you finally start playing the game. And while this is not appearant at first. It slowly start sinking in after about 2 - 3 levels of this non-stop ogre killing.  To be honest, it's trying to be a tower-defence game but utterly fails at it as there are worse looking titles out there that are more fun and more challenging.  The game runs on most computers, looks nice, has some funny animations at times, but utterly fails at delivering any type of gameplay that was promised. Well, to correct myself, fails to deliver any type of gameplay that is FUN and was promised.  Recommandation is to go buy warcraft 3 and play tower defence there.  Rating 9 of 100",0
repetitive and boring,0
"It's like Dugeon Defenders, But not fun",0
"Original, Fast Paced and Damn Addictive.  All 3 describe this game to maximum precision. It is such a fun game, hours can be eaten away form your hands playing through the extensive single player campaign. It does lack the single most important thing that would make this game more fun.   Multiplayer.  Seriously, without it, this game is bland, you want to experience the Orc mayhem with your buddies. Skip this one, go for the sequel.  WompWompWommmmmp/10",0
It looks fun doesn't it? yeah thats what I thought too. But that was before I got it.   The concept of being able to attack yourself and use towers is nice and when executed properly works well. Orcs Must Die did not execute it well. Its problem is that if you don't attack you fail and on most every map there are 2 points the orcs come from and there are not 2 of you so you kill 1 side while the other gets through then you go to push back the other side meanwhile the side you were protecting gets up and then your at the very end of the map trying to shoot 2 ways at 1 time and it doesn't work. The only tower to make your enemys stop (at least as far as I played) is not even a tower its a KILLABLE Paladin. So unless you make like 3 of those at each side they all die. Even with 3 they die. Even with lots of support from ranged towers they die. Without using them the enemys move too fast and your towers can't hit them for long enough to kill them and you die.  Another big problem is that they tryed to make too many towers. You get a tower after each level and they were probably running out of ideas and were just making stupid things. What I really don't like is that 90% of the towers have almost no difference except look or wether its on the wall or the floor or the ceiling. And alot of them just push the orcs so they are only usefull in certain levels where they can push the orcs off the level. Also the ceiling mounted ones alot are useless because the level will have too high ceilings and they won't hit anything.  It was fun for the first 8ish levels but overall I give it a 5/10. I would recommend you go buy Sanctum 2,0
"Nah. It's not a terrible game, but it's clunky and awkward. Micro-managing the camera angle is half of what you'll do when playing. Go look for a better tower defense game.",0

ERROR:Failed to load 'shaders\FixedFunctionShaders.ShaderLib' Engine will not run.,0
Didn't do it for me at all. Part of the joy of tower defense is watching your little machine devour enemies. I didn't enjoy running around inside the machine in some kind of mediocre 1st-person shooter. This made the game less fun for me.,0
"I'm not a huge fan of tower defense games to begin with, so meh. In this style, Dungeon Defenders was far more enjoyable.",0
Felt like this was more of a game to be played on my Smartphone then PC.  ,0
I played a few hours and got bored.,0
"Life is too short, Don't waste it.",0
Fun idea for a game but i'm finding it to be very glitchy. The opening cinematic freezes after about the fourth word the old man says and the third level refuses to load.,0
Definitely not one I'll play very often; but then I'm more about startegy &amp; tactics than brute force.,0
Orcs Must Die is one of my least favorite games. I think this would be a great game if it was sort of like Torchlight II. You really need a pet or an ally to help you. This game reminds me of an old game called Lemmings. It was impossible for me to prevent the Orcs from destroying everything. I never could master the gameplay. The demo was fun to play. The rest of the game was a nightmare.,0

Bad game. Not worth any money.,0
The sequel is better in every way possible. Avoid this.,0
"While OMD is a very cute game, it suffers from some fairly crippling design flaws. Firstly, most of the levels' difficulty results directly from one decision the devs made; instead of allowing choke-points or open spaces or a single path, the people who made this game decided that each level be bifurcated, but provided portals to allow us to traverse the two. Pick one, devs. Difficulty or ease. As well, barricades are among the most expensive single buildables. In this vein, it is much more economically viable to murder all the monsters yourself, as traps are A) very expensive and B) reset much too slowly. So why, for the love of Atheismo, is there only a 'cash bonus to trap kills' purchaseable!? Why can't we simply rely on weapons? Oh, right-- because the devs decided to split each level in two, so we can't simply use one route or the other. You're forced to use both the (mandatory) crossbow and (shoddy, unreliable) traps. Still, it's a fun romp, even for its faults and flaws.",0

Why continue to propagation of the wide misconception in our society that orcs are intrinsically evil and therefore must be slain. It is this kind of hatred propaganda that we need to have removed from our society and place out of reach of the impressionable minds of our youth.,0
I don't know.. if u have friends to play with u should buy this but if u dont dont buy...,0
"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  A few things that it does it does, decently.  This game, and its successor, in my opinion, were attempting to ride the coat-tails of the highly anticipated, and much more highly refined, Dungdeon Defenders. It is a poorly coded, excessively bland, tacky, generic FPS tower defense crossover. The DLC may as well be called 'EZ-mode'.  the voice acting will grind on your nerves, the enemies are so stupid.... its indescribable. They said they would come out with some multiplayer component (i.e. WTF THE GAME YOU WERE ATTEMPTING TO COPY HAS THIS AS ITS 3rd SELLING POINT, WHY DID YOU NOT INTEGRATE IT?) that would be DLC, but saw that there was enough demand for it that they would just crank out a sequel. That is the kind of developers you are supporting by buying this game. Yes Dungeon defenders has an excess of DLC, however they are still supporting it, this game has been left in the dust less than a year after it was released. The developers should feel shame.",0
"There is a lot of good things in Reincarnation, but the AI and map progression issues have not been resolved from the previous versions.  In general:  The Good: -Fun races, lots of units, nice strategic approach. -Nice Music. -Graphically appealing, while not being demanding. Well Optimized. (Not last gen tough). -Good Campaign Storyline. -Almost no bugs or glitches (so far). -Leveling system is addictive and dynamic. Can have different builds.  The Bad: -Horrible AI. Seriosuly.  -Strategic approach is fine, execution is terrible. Weird and unfair issues with CPU enemies. -Extremely slow paced gameplay. -Difficulty is based 100% in the raw power of the enemy armies and it scales poorly as the game goes on. -Once behind it's almost impossible to recover.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Now, explaining with more detail:  1.- Disciples is a franchise that relies heavily into the management of the encounters you have. The main strategy of the matches rely heavily in how you develop your troops WITHOUT DYING, mainly because the game punishes you hard if you loose a leveled squad. In the past, this kind of difficulty was appealing, but by today standards, it's just not well implemented. The game is more about choosing the right targets to level up and not about the strategic combat. This means that the difficulty is developed by the way you approach the leveling and not about the challenge of battling or developing the resources.  2.- The AI is just broken.  During the map phase, all the enemy armies just clean the mobs and level up in a certain rate, making few mistakes, while you need to see your way trough the random neutral troops that can range from easy to impossible. While the idea of having a linear leveling experience is boring, making you roam the map searching for the right mobs seems hardly an improvement. This is worsened by the fact that you can't afford to loose a single troop from the squad, so you will be repeating certain battles just for the sake of keeping the squad alive and not loose time in healing (wich, too, can be punishing in certain situations). And you can add to this the fact that while you loose time choosing targets, the AI already knew the right path so now it's 3 levels abobe you and still power-clearing camps.  In combat is worse. Melees will approach to engage, ranged will target the nearest high priority target (weakest). No much variation there. All the difficulty relies in you having to clear the lesser troops because usually the neutral enemies will have an outstanding threat that you need to carefully engage if you don't want to get one-shotted. And that is all. It's an easy clean or a fight you will have to repeat until the mobs behave the way you needed or until certain platforms that give you power spawn in better positions for you (wich ends up being the only strategy that the field of battle provides and that is completely random. The AI will rarely use them well).  -While fun and useful when you level and clear the map, spells are rather secondary. They can be extremely necesary in certain maps that have incredible neutral camps difficulties; and be just a fun thing to do in other scenarios.   Don't get me wrong with this review. Reincarnation is still a good game. It pretty much is a revamp of disciples 2 with a new combat system that is not really that cool. But i can hardly recommend it with all the issues it haves. Gaming has gone a long way from the games that had broken gameplay and weird AI issues. D3 should have been the improvement in those departments and not just the downfall because they not only couldn't fix them but maked them worse.  There were other minor issues, but i settled with the most important in my opinion. To do this review i waited to play enough time, but now I felt like I was ready to give an honest, objective opinion about the game.  Cheers! ",0
"Disappointing again. It's no wonder this studio has crashed and burned.  As a longtime fan of the Disciples franchise who has been with the games since first release, I was excited for months after hearing about Renaissance. Like a lot of folks, I was legitimately upset by the poor quality of the finished game: Other than the beautiful graphics, nothing was right. The feel of the old games was gone along with the Mountain Clans and Undead Hordes factions, and gameplay was plagued by bugs and design flaws. I bought Resurrection in the hope that it might include patches and balancing to fix the vanilla game, and was let down again.  When I saw Reincarnation in the Steam store, I managed to get excited yet again, and bought it on impulse.  If you like Disciples, don't make that mistake.  Gameplay is smoother and the game runs a little better, yes, but the combat alone is ten times as frustrating. I can't count how many times I've loaded a save because just one or two low-level enemy units can chew through your entire force, in campaign mode. Also changed for the worse is the character advancement system, where previously units would upgrade into new, more powerful forms so long as you had the proper structure built in your capital; now, units must level up 3 times before transforming. Good luck surviving that long, and that's from a veteran player and a pretty decent TBS tactician.  Overall, even with improvements, Reincarnation is almost too exhaustingly irritating to play, especially in the long sessions for which you might normally enjoy a TBS.  4/10",0
"I wanted very, very badly to like Disciples 3. The art is as stunning as Disciples 2, perhaps even more so. However, the balance is all off - XP gain is not proportional to threats, combat is a slow and frustrating affair (unless you're losing, at which point it will end in two rounds), and even after battles that I've won I had to make a trip back to my capital every single time to resurrect people. And then, if I'm unlucky, sit and mash 'END TURN' until I have the money to afford them.  The fact that I can only claim land in specific points also adds to the tedium, as I have to watch my territory ponderously expand toward resource cites that I've cleared out for dozens of turns before they are claimed.  Of course, the quest dialogue and voice-overs are terrible. Fortunately there's an easy way to turn unit voices off.  There were plenty of improvements between Disciples 2 and Disciples 3, by the way. Combat is now on a tactical grid a la Heroes of Might &amp; Magic. Each grid has randomly-determined sites that can increase the effectiveness of one unit type, and leveraging these effectively can make a moderate battle into an easy one (although they still don't make difficult battles into reasonable threats). Some overworld spells can be cast into runes, which can then be used to cast a scaled-down version of the spell during a battle. Heroes have something not unlike a very toned-down version of the Sphere Grid from Final Fantasy X, or the leveling system in Final Fantasy 12 - basically a grid in which each square has some sort of bonus, and you can claim any square adjacent to an already-claimed square when leveling up.  But ultimately I'd give this one a skip, even as a fan of the genre.",0
"Do not buy this game if having access to the editor is important to you. It requires a cd key, which steam will not provide. Attempting to get a cd key from them results in them informing you that the game doesn't come with a cd key and then, if you keep going despite the clearly copy/pasted 'support', telling you that you have to deal with third party support.",0
"Don't buy this,  They promised to fix the original and make the story and gameplay better. They didn't, the story is now very weak, and the gameplay is wonky. you now need to level up 3 times before a unite goes to the next stage, the avarage length of a campaign mission is roughly 900 turns now.  then there are the things that made the original so broken (the crashing, the freezing, the savegames dissapearing) Those are still there. all in all they Broke what didn't need to be fixed, and they didn't fix what was broken.  GG DIII, GG...",0
If you enjoyed Disciples 2 i would stay away from this one...,0
"I was a fan of Disciples 1 and 2 but all the Disciples 3 games seems to me inferior and not fun at all. The comparison to  Heroes of Might &amp; Magic  is very misleading because, in  Disciples , the level up of your units is so long that you have to keep the same 4-6 units for a whole map and grind slowly with many small battles without an ounce of tactics. The art is not as good as in Disciples 2. And the highest graphics settings don't do any good because of a very mediocre engine. Conclusion : Highly disappointed. I can't see any redeeming quality for this game.",0
"I will start with the improvements.   1. More NPC bands and treasure on the map making it easier to level up and makes the terrain map a closer feel to D2.   2. Boats  Now the fails between Older versions of D3 and this pile of poo.  1. The character info screen. Tab #2 to see my XP? It's the stat I look at most often. Wait... WTF! Tabs!?!?!?! The right click character info from the older D3 editions were closer to D2 (and better).  2. The 3 tier levelling process of your support units. Again these guys made changes where older D3 editions got it right. I don't want to dump that much combat experience into a disposable unit before he upgrades. 'Look! I only need to play 643 more hours before my squire levels to paladin'... Go die. This also makes it harder to have multiple well supported leaders, so Lambert has the paladin while your other leaders rock squires and knights.  Side note: Your characters that die in combat also gain experience... This felt strangely like cheating.  3. The smaller battle map. Either copy Heros of Might and Magic, or stick with static formation turn based combat like D2 and old classics like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger. The smaller map makes it near pointless to move around and puts your ranged units and magic users in harms way like never before.  'Oh, Look! You got creative in an uninspired game'. Your creative efforts have gained you a hybrid, akin to the crap you take that comes out like you've been eating cheese for a month, but leaves your butt dirty like Taco Bell diarrhea.  4. The ranged/magic user unit's attack range has been limited (which was never a thing in any previous installment). Ranged units were weaker, but could hit anything on screen, so you never had to move them into melee combat, or off bonus tiles (in D3). This further weakens an already weak support unit. I assume this was meant to draw ranged units off the bonus tiles by having your melee units 'Run Away!'. Pro Tip: concentrate attack on bonus ranged/magic unit. They will not have that bonus after 1 =&gt; 2 rounds of combat. Limiting range of ranged units = EPIC FAIL!!!!",0
"The game has gotten better then other D3 games, But there are TONS of typos, Bad or senceless sentences. they had over a year to fix this but they havent done that. That soooo says no support, so if you get into trouble with this title, your mostly out of luck.",0
"This game is okay, other than the mindblown fact that they released this game for purchased on steam without giving any serial code/keys to unlock the toolkit. If you guys are planning to buy it for self modding, just don't waste time.",0
"I only blame steam for selling a game that doesnt have support , or atleast they should mention ' warning this game doesnt have a support ' it crashes for me as soon as i start it and at the menue the game crash and something writen in weird language apeare , I posted in the forum but no replay then i found out this game doesnt have support so if you are lucky it will work and if you have any issues thats it you lost what you paid ( sorry for my horrible english -_-)",0
"Nothing really new in this version of the game, i was hoping to find new faction and/or units, in fact no. A new campaign is okay, but i was hoping to find a bit more for this price.  if you haven't played to Disciple 3, this version is okay but if you've played to the others, spend your money on another game, trust me",0
"Recommend not playing this game on hard. The game isn't good enough to warrant the extra challenge it entails. If you're playing because you liked Disciples 2, then you're probably playing for the story (which admittedly isn't very good either). Took me about 120 hours to finish the first campaign. That's with less than 50 turns used per mission, minimal potions and spells, and full clear every map. Pretty brainless for me overall aside from occasional battle rigging, watched One Piece while playing this.  Gameplay: Concept changes all around for the most part but the core difficulty remains approximately the same. A lot of battles need to be rigged to be won or return when higher leveled. Tactics and proper magic usage will for the most part win most battles. If we're comparing difficulty between this game and Disciples 2 (hard difficulty), they are approximately the same but functioning off different systems. You still had to rig battles in Disciples 2 until your hero was OP and magic was also pretty important as well. The critical strike system is pretty bad though. Some new features like the 'guardians' are pretty terrible, rodbearers were exponentially better.   Overall, might be worth buying on sale if you were a fan of Disciples 2 otherwise stick with HoMM series. Game wasn't bad, but it's not worth recommending to the average player.",0
"Get Age of Wonders 3 instead, no question. The campaigns here are badly paced, the skirmish maps FORCE your race choice, 'counterattack' is called 'intercept' even though it happens second, and the map and fighting are 97% HoMM. AoW3 is more like a prettier Fallen Enchantress.",0
"Not the same as Disciples 2, combat sucks and story is boring.",0
"Great art work, story, music! More new units in this game! Also the developers did a great job in debug! Great! but..... Hard boring and wasting a lot of time upgrading soldiers! ur soldier must reach lvl 5 to achieve a higher tier, before lvl 5 ur soldiers are toys! save and reload! wasting a lot of time! u cannot enjoy a smooth game play and the story! the neutral units are blocking way everywhere and u cannot even beat them because ur toy soldiers are weak!!!! also, comptuer has greater chance to cause critical hit: kill ur soldiers in mere 1 hit!!! HAX! ( such as neutral unit Male Griffin: almost 100% critical hit is that fair??) i already said ur soldiers are toys, which means greater chance to [miss]! when fighting against neutral units! this game makes me disappointed! I am huge fun of disciples! Disciples 2 is epic, but well disciples 3 Reincarnatinon ....i have to say: hehe!! when i writing this i played 10+ hrs, but i am still at the beginning of the empire quest! i feel bored. i don't want to carry on! bored to death when upgrading my toy soldiers!  well i was pretty bested by the male griffins ( neutral unit )! dat almost 100% critcal hit and kill my toys with mere 1 hit! this game is so vicious that we have to reach lvl 5 to achieve a higher tier! and when u made it, guess what u will find ur precious skill points of ur toy soliders disappeared without a trace! r u kiding me? what do the developers want? wasting our time?? they seems so vicious to prolong the gameplay time by making some vicious design! i was a fun of disciples! i played Disciples from 1-3! but never saw a Disciples game so vicious like this!! u k wat i feel now! bored to death when upgrading my toy soliders! toys are toys! before lv 5 ur soldiers are toys! Pls nerf Male Griffin  Also i need to chill........i must be responsible for my review so i came to edit this when i am chilled down &lt;My wish for this game&gt; I am a huge fun of Disciples from 1 to 3, just cannot stop playing it! but on behalf of all funs these years i have to say developers pls make ur game more epic,( not ....u k wat i say)! pls don't prolong gameplay by doing that! guys u must fix it! otherwise no one will carry on because u bored them to death. if u want ppl to say u game is good, at least ur game must give ppl the great passion to keep on! pls try XCOM enemy unknown(2k games) and see the difference.... (try the new DLC enemy within) and tell me which game give u a better feeling to keep on??  IF it is not the end, i think the developers are planning to make a new DLC: Return of the mountain clans!!! If not this game has not ended!",0
"Well I tried to give this sorry excuse of a game another try. I purchased it when it first came out and the combat system was terrible. It takes like 10 rounds to beat goblins and imps. The enemy always has the advantage moving onto conveniently place focus points to screw you over and running like a little crap if you even get near killing one of its spell casters to another conveniently place spell power focus area. The computer will score criticals on your units and then immediately get another turn it seems due to 'good initiative.' I am sure the units get much better and each time I try to play this game it just flat out cheats. I will be a level 1 hero in the campaign and it will throw me against rogues and I have no chance of hitting them where they just take turns wasting my units.   Your hero is supposed to be the leader of these armies and to me they feel like a bunch of weaklings and it really takes away from the epic feel the game is trying to bestow. I was really hoping this would be a good patch and it started promising, but it failed again. I agree with many of the users that gave a negative review or even a posititve review, JUST PLAY DISCIPLES II IS A MUCH BETTER GAME! I don't understand how pitching six to eight units in a quick style combat is so hard for the Disciples III team to make. Start the battle and just have the units hit one another! No focus points or movement and all that crap! Make the units have significantly less HP and scale the difficulty! D+ only because the graphics and artwork are great.",0
"I think the positive reviews are mostly due to extremely lowered expectations from the previous disciples iii releases. Although improved, still no comparison to the original titles. There are some good points about the game, but in general progression is extremely slow, fights are repetitive and not rewarding (in terms of XP but also artifacts are boring). There is no AI, more or less you fight only against natural groups of monsters.",0
"Personally I don't like Reincarnation much since they twisted the game so much and a lot of unbalanced stuffs happened, like the Imp, I always thought that Small Imps are 'tier 1' creatures like they had always been in D2 and the last 2 D3 versions. But not anymore, they are now nightmares for your all tier 1 troop which mostly have around 8 to 12 Accuracy while those Imps have 43 Invasion (you will miss - a lot), and 140 health and 33 damage and 30 Accuracy (they do CRIT a lot, almost all the time) and 28 Initiative... basically, you just can't win against them without using some spells. And some more things I don't like to mention here as it will be too long.",0
"At first I was looking forward to some good old Disciples after the years, thinking there will be some innovative touch here and there. What awaited me, though, was one big unbalanced mess.   For one, interface and new approach to castles we already know and love were steps in the right direction. Also the new approach to the character upgrades with some minor boosts to troops pleasantly surprised me. On the other hand, the battle-system is maybe the most broken one I've encountered to date. I don't know if I somehow played it wrong (but considering I've read through tutorials and such, I think it wasn't my fault after all), but battles were just lenghty, repetitive chore. In every and each one of them you need to have one hell of luck on your side, because enemies are 'tough'. And the reason for quation marks is simple. I thought maybe I just chose bad enemies for the beginning of a map. Then I realized it's the same story with every enemy unit I attack, not only you have to pray so your troops actually hit something every now and then, but also you have to deal with the illusion of some strategy on that little Heroes rip-off action map. I understand that change is very important part in everything, but for the God's sake don't change that one kind of unique thing, which was perfectly functional, simple yet fun to play with.  To summarize it, I wouldn't recommend this to anybody, especially not to the Disciples fans. Good idea killed by totally non-functional battle-system.",0
"With beautiful visuals, amazing soundtrack, and the Disciples name in the title what could possibly go wrong? Well the most important part of the game, the combat, kills the game. It's clunky, difficult to control your troops, you cant pick which direction to attack the enemy from (flanking and such), and the camera acts weird. I've only played like 2 hours and already I'm losing interest. If only they would have designed the battle part of this game better...I'd be hooked.",0
"This game probably plays very nicely; however, there is literally no support for the game for modern computers. I am trying to run it on a high-end gaming PC (nVidia 970M, 16GB RAM, plenty of hdd and ssd space, lots of processing power, no other nonessential processes running in the background) and I can barely run this game at medium settings, which are only one step above 'low'. I tried messing with all combinations of video settings, and the game still failed. When I tried googling for documentation to troubleshoot this problem, all I found were a few words about Disciples 2 that stated that one must enable Direct3D in the graphics settings. Sadly, there is no such setting in Disciples 3.  As such, the game is essentially unplayable to anyone with a fairly new computer. I'd strongly advise against purchasing the game.",0
Not a horrible game but there are quite a few better choices out there.,0
"This game is bad. But it is that cheesy kind of bad which everybody (OK, die-hard fans of Disciples) like. I suppose the guys tried to sort of remake the Disciples II but got short on money halfway through. In Reincarnation you get no playable Dwarves but you get see and play your good ol' undead and demons and humans from DII. Buuut, the units are imbalanced which is topped by a fiendish in-game interface and bugged scripts which render the some missions incompletable. But hey, bugs, interfacece and level scaling (yep, seriously the game expects you to topple 30level enemy during first campaigns mission when you max level is 5) aside, the storyline seems pretty enjoyable so far.",0
"Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss   Unless you don't want to see a lot of this when you play, then stay far away from this game.   It tries to be Heroes of M&amp;M but the combat is just terrible.  Don't be taken in by the nice graphics and reviews, this is a bad development team based on what I have seen.",0
"I tried to play this game on few occasions, and it always makes me regret it. It's a barely playable mess. Reincarnation is a transformation of original Disciples 3, that tries so hard to be like Disciples 2, that it makes you wonder: why play this, when you have an excellent Disciples 2? Akella made the same game THRICE, and while Disciples 2 is an improvement to 1, Reincarnation is not even close to being equally good as either of the previous entries. They changed this game into a bad version of Disciples 2, worse in almost every aspects (if not literally every).   I can stand the unintuitive UI and sluggish controls, but I can't - for the love of all that is holy - bear the combat and that is my main issue with this game.  First, we have a leader that is completely useless. I don't even know if he will become a force to be reckoned with later on, he is useless at the beginning and dies from one or two hits, while dealing 1/3 as much damage as normal units. Then we have the overall balance of combat; it's INCREDIBLY hard. I don't understand how am I supposed to defeat even one group of enemies that have some overpowered units with hundreads of health and AoE attacks that two-shots my mages and heroes. It's not like they are not standing right in front of my base, guarding basic resources... Is this a game about exploration and looking for that one, specific group of enemies that will allow me to level up? Or is this a game about taking that one-and-only useful hero and a very specific combination of units? Neither of these appeal to me, and neither of these was mandatory in Disciples 2.  Hotseats (that can be played with AI) feels just unplayable. Campaign is barely more bearable, but equally not fun with the clunky, slow and random combat. I felt like they lowered hit chance to around the same, idiotic values as in Disciples 1 or even lower and one, just ONE miss can completely ruin whole encounter.  Mind you, I don't take into account the artstyle and music. It's good, art is even great, but a hit or miss sometimes. It can be gorgeous at times and it can be ugly on another asset or picture, but the overall design is what you would expect from the series: unique and very atmospheric.",0
"It's alright I mean. The combat becomes tedious and kind of boring. Honestly might be worth a skip, the story is pretty meh too. Don't expect your leaders to do much of anything. The enemies will have 1000 hp and your leader can only hit 10-25. In 8 hours of playing I have only hit a few bugs. One made it so that I was stuck on act one for a long time. I had to keep clicking this log until a goblin came.",0
"Okay, if you’re going to transform the game into Heroes Of Might and Magic, try at least not to make same mistakes. Though, Disciples is NO Heroes, it will never be Heroes nor it needs to be. The 2D and Pseudo 3D aspects of Disciples II, I loved every bit of it so F…ck very much for ruining it.  I don’t like the artwork, also the interactive objects in the game world are hardly identifiable, yes it takes some getting used to however the game lost all the Disciples appeal that attracted me in the first place.  To stupid devs - more textures and fancy 3D does not necessarily mean a better game, it’s time for you to learn that.",0
"I don't really see this game as being worthy, I feel like it's just trying to be Might and Magic Heroes, if anything, get the old Might and Magic Heroes 3 on GOG.",0
"Im not so sure about this game it seemed fun at first when i was playing the tutorial but the game seems so slow and bland it gets boring very fast and the spells are just stupid, seems like this game is perhaps an older and less evolved version of age of wonders which ive played the entire series of and absolutly love so when i saw this game i was exspecting something similar with its own twist but i was quite disappointed at its lack of customizabillity, options and combat expirence, i cant really recommend a game that left me feeling bored on the first level.",0
The custom mouse cursor in the game is stuck and I have to guess where my mouse really is. Not even gonna bother playing.,0
"While I really like the game play and the fighting mechanics, It is really hard to get started in any quest. The random encounters are way to overpowered for any level 1 party to get starred I had to give up. Do not buy.",0
"Well, I loved Disciples II. I played the game for countless hours. I loved the artwork, I loved the races, I loved the gameplay. It was a great, darker alternative to that other fantasy strategy/RPG game. There was just something about the game that enthralled me. I really wanted the next installment to be like the second. Unfortunately, it's not.  It looks like the AI is basically set up in such a manner that the higher the difficulty, the more your units just plain suck at combat.  First encounter into the game, my units miss more than they hit. Miss, miss, miss. That's what I saw in the first encounter. And the second. And the third.  The problem is, there's nothing I can do tactically to change this. I can jump on the focus points all I want in combat, but if my units still just whiff every time, I've got no chance. And if the enemy pounced on the focus points before I have a chance to? Well, forget it.  I've played the game for a couple of hours, and already I just plain despise it. I don't mind losing if it's because of the wrong tactical choices I've made, but when I've got no chance as a LVL 1 party because we just miss every time, forget it. I'm done.  I wanted to love this game because I adored the predecessors. This one just makes me never want to play it again.",0
"Not a good game. Battle mechanic is clumsy and uncomfortable. Foes are EXTREMELY overpowerd.  Spend most of my time stuck in a small area surrounded by unbeatable foes. Same old hero's and units, very little has changed. Cannot sterss enough how stupid the battles are and it lost all it's fun. it's just isn't working!  Such a huge downgrade from Diciples 2 which I absolutely loved and played for many years! Didn't enjoy it even though I really tried (I spent 10$ on it, believe me I tried).  NOT RECOMMENDED!",0
"Nothing changed, still unplayable piece of ****.",0
tedious,0
"I really tried to get into this game, but it just never was a disciples 2 game. The combat doesn't match, the art style is nice, but doesn't match. Not having the dwarves ruins the game too. I want to burn this game.",0
"Sorry no. This game just doesn't have enough gameplay to warrant even a single campaign playthrough. I guess they blew their entire budget on graphics, and forgot the important bits. I understand there are not a whole lot of games with turn based strategy, so you might be inclined to give this game a try just like me, but you'll be very disappointed with this game.",0
"still very disappointing, interface and gameplay are very cluncky. Nowhere near as good as Heroes, Age of Wonders, Warlock, etc.  The voice acting, music and art are very good though.",0
"First of, the game is horribly buggy and impossible to finish, which sucks, because up until now the franchise was brilliant. Dont get me wrong, the game is beautiful and the story is inmersing, but the bugs completelly break the game, many battles (specially boss battles) are simply unwinnable, therefore so is the game. I wouldnt recomend buying this game, not even in sales.",0
"bland, unexciting battles, clumsy controls... really dissapointing game. You have to force yourself to progress, you are not drawn into the game.",0
"I love 4x games but I'd rather play HOMM 3 or 5 for the millionth time that waste my time here. I'm incredulous that this is a game that has had three expansion packs because it doesn't even have a single player mode. Yep, your options are to play the simplistic campaign or a hotseat or network multiplayer game.   I'm a gamer so I don't like when game companies go out of business but if this is representative to the games they made it is no loss they are gone.  Something I just noticed is pretty much nobody has any real hours into this game. That should speak louder than anything else.",0
"Few tings WHY not to buy this game.  1. This is NOT Disciples anymore.  It's just another sh*tty Heores clone. Balance is re-done according to 'chessboard' change, and - not really recalculated properly. Now it sucks.  Where's the WHOLE F*CKING IDEA OF A CHESSBOARD WITH ONLY 6 SLOTS GODDAMIT???? The one, that was building up the whole gameplay you know, the one htat was requiring for you to calculate your army carefully, and use every single possibility to overcome your opponent? And what's with these special spots on the battlefield?  I mean, comoooooon... Shoot me at least 2 differences from heroes? Can you? Different sprites??? Or Uglier GUI??? Jeesus, Disciples was one of the BEST, and from my perspective - mainly because of this unique and interesting balance idea of a chessboard.  Now - disciples has nothing to offer except a bug reports, and ugly... graphics. And really poor storyline of course too.    2. Akella, aaaah Akella...  The WORST releaser in the world keeps up with it's own 'fame'...  I am trying to get trough first level of Demons for a f*cking week already...  Crashes ALL the time. From my previous experience of communicating with them about some crashes - it just do not work. They *usualy* just don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about customer.  I really do not remember even single 'OK' release by that company, not to speak of 'Good' ones.  If only I would take care and read about that they are involved BEFORE I bought this game - I simply wouldn't. It's sooo obvious, that if the game is marked by that publisher - it just wouldn't work.",0
"I like the old disciples better. Game pace has became is too slow for my taste &amp; high level mobs in the first level, really?",0
"A quick disclaimer: I've only played through the tutorial. I think this is enough to review the game, but some may disagree. It's obvious that this is a failed attempt to move Disciples 2 almost verbatim into 3D space, so I'm comfortable laying this out here.  They tried so many times to make Disciple 3 the game it should've been, but it just never lived up to 2. I understand the desire to move the game into 3D, but all the wonderful visuals I loved from the first title were sacrificed in the transition. They changed the battle system to hex-based from static turn-based, like every other game in this genre that felt stale years ago (AoW, King's Bounty, HoMM, etc). While the audio wasn't perfect in the original, it has even less impact now that it did before.",0
"Turn based combat and a overcrowded ui. Looks like warcraft 3, not a bad thing if it was 2002 all over again...",0
"This game really upset me. First of all I would, say that this game worse that Disciples II. Icons of units dont understandable. Secondy, where is mountain clans? Thirdly, too easy to conquer capitals. Finally, this battle web is so awful. 4/10",0
"I like this game but I totally hate the orrible reduced movement range in battle and the reduced shooting range for archers and mage characters. This totally let me down, I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone. Waste of money for me. This is my PERSONAL opinion.",0
"Sarge, take me back to disciples II im tired of this ****",0
The game is glitchy for me. The mouse pointer does not work. So I can't play the game.,0
"You will most likely ignore me and waste your money but still.... Game is long abandoned. Still have tons of bugs, very poor storyline, gameplay try to look like heroes of might and magic and fails.  disciples 2 better than this in any way. Just buy it if you want real disceples experience.",0
"Have to say, bugs aside (didn't encounter any so far) this game feels very poorly made. The graphics are awfull (at High). The voices are even worse than graphics. It sound's as if someone made the voices for the game while it the toilet. The previous two games were much better evan though they containd a lot of bugs. I am 'Discples' fan and i have played in all of their relises, have to say, this is the worst one so far. I am very disapointed!!!",0

With 50 hours under my belt, I've managed to complete 1 of the four campaigns, allowing me to deliver a person from Point A to Point B. That's it. That's all that can be meaningfully said to have happened in the story.",0
"Avoid this one! It plays like an old school HoMM, but it is just broken. The AI will gobble up mobs (and almost always be higher level), yet when you fight it behaves incredibly simple and very easy to predict/control. There is very little deviation in troop layout, the battle maps are extremely small, and movement is very limited. All combined makes for almost no deviation in strategy. You'll find one (maybe 2) strategies that work and that's it! Don't bother trying to have fun, just repeat the same strategy for every single fight and walk around the map some more. Oh wait, sometimes you have to buff your army before a fight. I guess that makes it refreshing and new.  I really wanted to like this game. I liked the first 2 Disciples, and I like the HoMM style of gameplay. The graphics are nice too. But, this game is just broken.",0

"This game was a pretty decent F2P game before Aeria Games took over.  Now it's just Combat Arms but better graphics. Pay to win. Pay to get decent guns.   Also full of hackers.  The fact that these game companies exsit make me sick. Aeria Games, you have no respect from me and probably 99.9% of PC Gamers.",0
"Let me go on record to say that this game is fun. It has some good gamemodes, some good combat, and overall, it's a very good counter-strike knockoff. then the problems start. First: this game installs a keylogger. THAT'S ♥♥♥♥ING RIGHT. IT INSTALLS A 3RD-PARTY KEYLOGGER FOR ANTI-CHEAT MEASURES. It's also nearly impossible to remove, unless you extremely specifically remove something from System32, then from Regedit, but i'm not even going to try. Second: The company that  made  bought the rights to this game filled it up with weapons that you have to buy for... with real. world. money. Here's the best part: the weapons have better stats, but disappear from your inventory after a while. You know what that means? A Paytowin FPS. Even if they didn't have other stats, they're just retextures of other items, for example, you could have a normal smoke grenade, or get a colored one for an additional fee. Personally, i only installed this to get the black rose in TF2, but found myself playing it more than expected. I uninstalled it several months ago, and just now found out about the keylogger.   DON'T INSTALL THIS GAME. NOT EVEN FOR THE BLACK ROSE. IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK.  ",0
Every one just plays for the Black Rose right?,0
"First off, don't get fooled by my played hours, I've been playing it way before it was avaiable on steam but I didn't touch it since around 1.5 years. I would estimate that my played hours are somewhere around 3k, I've also participated in 2 tournaments. I would still love this game and recommend it to everyone and their grandma if Aeria wouldn't have messed up AVA like they did.  AVA was a great game back when ijji published it, it had great potential. The maps are great, nothing to complain about here. You could buy Weapons, Grenades and Armor for ingame money. You would get money relatively slow, but once you hit 50-60k € you could buy a decent, permanent weapon and that's pretty much all you needed. You also need money to repair that weapon and buy parts for your weapon that need to get replaced regularly. Getting 50-60k could take up to 1-2 months, depending on how much you played. You could still spend real money on weapons in order to get them immediately. It still was not pay to win at all. The graphics were actually decent for a F2P game. You would encounter hackers from time to time, depending on whether there were any free hacks out there or not.  Ever since Aeria games took over things changed. Their biggest failure was the removal of permanent weapons, which ultimately made the game pay to win. You could only buy weapons for 30 days, then they expired. The price of a decent weapon was still around 50-60k, and I guess you already see that this is a huge problem. If you don't play 3-4 hours per day you won't be able to get 50-60k per month, that means you have to play with the standard weapons which are not entirely useless, but you would never beat someone who is on the same skill level as you with a standard weapon while he uses his expensive rifle. This also meant that old players will always have an advantage over new players, because they still have their permanent weapons.   The thing is, you may think that the publisher should have no influence on the content of the game, since they are only publishing, but not making it. Redduck is actually making the game, and they do so for several other regions such as Japan/China/Korea. All of those regions still have permanent weapons. In fact, Aeria denied to have anything to do with the change from permanent to timed weapons, but we actually contacted someone from Redduck who told us that they were against that change, but Aeria insisted.  The next point are hackers. Aeria implemented a new anti cheat engine that doesn't do its job at all. There were times where you would run into a hacker every 2-3 games. I can't tell you how it is in its current state tho, since I haven't played since quite some time.  By the way, Aeria introduced the 'Tiered Spender' where you would get additional rewards depending on how much money you spend on their game. That's a nice concept, but the thing is that many of those additional rewards are permanent weapons, which is another aspect that makes it pay to win. Just to give you an idea on what you have to spend for a permanent weapon: In one of those tiered spenders you would get a permanent weapon starting at 7999 AP(a little more than 60€) and ending at 29999 AP(around 210€).  This is coming from someone who sometimes played this game all day long, played 2 tournaments and even made a few videos, my best montage got around 2k views, my overall best AVA video has around 10k views. If you have LOTS of money and can live with the fact that this game is pay to win then by all means, get it. I've been putting a decent amount of money into this game myself, and I would never do it again. Money still doesn't buy you skill, but it surely gives you an huge advantage. The next thing to consider are the hackers, everytime there are free hacks on a certain site AVA will be unplayable, and you might even get banned despite being a legitimate player (At one point hackers were able to use your name, which earned you lots of reports). And then I wish you good luck with Aerias automated support answers when you try to appeal a ban.  In the end it's up to you, but I can not recommend it in its current state.   *UPDATE*  I still play a round or two every few months, and I was positively surprised when I played yesterday. Permanent guns are back, but they are really expensive and it surely will take you quite some time until you have enough money for a good gun. I think they need to either make the weapons cheaper, or give you the option to try them out for free before you buy them permanently. It now feels a lot like back in the days when I still used to play this game all day long, but it still has a few pay to win elements. You are still not going to be able to beat a good player if you are average and spend a lot of money, but it's harder for beginners to get into the game, because it will take lots of time until you found the right gun, can afford it, and got enough money to buy armor as well. So it's not pay to win in the sense that bad players will defeat good players because they spent money, but good players who already have an advantage over new/bad players will have an even bigger advantage, so expect to have a hard time in the beginning if you plan on playing AVA.   If you are starting out I recommend you check out some guides because there are some things you should know that are not immediately obvious. Here is an (old) thread that's actually meant for players who want to play AVA competitively, but still is relevant and could give you some useful tips:  http://www.aeriagames.com/forums/en/viewtopic.php?t=1885997   Hackers are still around, but it's not as bad as it used to be. It is understandable that they can't prevent hacking, because they can only react to hacks after they have been released for the most part. They surely are doing things to stop hackers before they actually get to do any damage, we have XIGNCODE after all. It's similar to bugs and glitches, if you programming a game or program you are going to try to avoid bugs, but you can't eliminate every single bug before they actually occured. The best you can do is try to prevent them to your best ability, so there will be as few bugs as possible.  So, I still don't recommend this game, altho it got a lot better. AVA is on a good path right now and maybe I will one day be able to recommend it again. I even think I'm going to play it more regularly from now on. Maybe I will give AVA a positive review one day, but today is not that day.",0

"Be aware of Aeria Games. They are a large f2p game publisher with many titles, and many genres; Mostly fps and mmorpg. They are known for their numerous pay-to-win models, where those to throw cash away to buy powerful guns for use on those that haven't spent anything. They intice more people into playing their games by partnering up with other companies and creating promotional content, i.e. the black rose in Team Fortress 2.   AVA was not always in the hands of aeria games, and when it wasn't it was a generic fps that was great for a few minutes of brainless shooting. Now it's exactly the same thing, only with a pay-to-win scheme along with many hackers who wish to get their own overpowered slaughterhouse feel without paying.  Not worth your time to download. In fact, I would recomend against downloading, as it will install a rootkit for anti-cheating purposes that will cause many problems and is a pain in the neck to remove.",0
"Oh, you done ♥♥♥♥ed up, Aeria. AVA @ 2012: Great game, most of all things were working, weapons were cheap and easy to get, and respectful community. Oh yeah, I definately enjoyed those survival maps. Hours played are from the good ol' times... *sigh*. _____________________________________________________________  AVA @ 2014: Hackers, added their 'secksyy women' to add to the P2P, trash community, hitregs are terrible, and weapons = the price of a Maybach Exelero. Also, the cash you earn is not even worth even a pistol.  What the hell Aeria, you made this game better than your other failed garbages, but now, you transfer your ideas from one destroyed game to this. Also, ijji executed this way better, and after you transferred, I couldn't get my damn account back!  0/10 Would rather jump off the Willis Tower rather than to play this  EDIT: After almost 2 years, I decided to give this game another chance, but my account was embedded in the starter (the blocked account). I even tried to use my backup email to try to play it again, but nope, ♥♥♥♥ me, I don't get a chance because I 'violated' their terms... I'm guessing it's for not giving them money.",0
"let's be honest, nobody is actually going to play this for anything other than the tf2 item",0
"First of all, I have been playing this game for 5 years and I have witnessed the decline of this game.  To start of with the positives:  + Good graphics. + Wide selection of weapons. + Wide selection of maps and game modes. + You used to be able to play this game for hours on end and not get bored.   Now for the negatives:  - The most cancerous community you can ever imagine. Full of 12 year olds who spam constantly and cry about pretty much everything, they single-handedly destroy this game without the following negatives being taken into account.  - No functioning mute button which is really needed with this community.  - Cheaters, they tend to come in waves when public cheats are released. Think cheaters in games such as CSGO are a problem? There is probably a 75% chance that you will face at least one cheater in the Matchmaking channel each game you queue up for - unfortunately that figure is not greatly exaggerated and that is only considering the kids running around with blatant wall hacks and 1 hit kill cheats.  - Terrible publisher, they honestly do not give a fk about what the community wants unless it affects their income in a positive way. Sure, I understand it is a business, but not investing in a functioning anti-cheat, and instead focusing on the new tier-spender (a pay-to-win model) to satisfying those credit card whales is not the way to maintain a game.  - Non-functioning anti-cheat, it's clearly not doing its job properly, and it gives random errors to legit players such as myself causing my game to crash for no reason.  - Free-to-play, you'd think this would be a positive, but any kid that gets banned cheating can easily make a new account and farm it to a level in a few hours which allows them back into matchmaking.  - Lag, this game has two servers to serve 6 continents; the EU server is supposed to support Europe, Africa and Asia whereas the NA server is supposed to support North America, South America and Oceania. It is not uncommon to face teams with 200+ pings on their closest server, and this game does not have an effective IP-restriction for those countries for which the license does not cover.  - Hit registration, if you play CSGO you've probably heard the common quote 'Volvo pls fix 64 tick servers', and guess what, AVA is a significant downgrade on those servers, I believe somewhere in the region of 16 tick servers. This coupled with extreme laggers (the average ping in EU is probably around 70 and over 150 in NA) leads to countless frustrating encounters where you hit people first on your screen but end up dying behind a wall to a 300 ping BR.  - RNG elements, in a competitive FPS, you would expect RNG (random number generation) to be kept to a minimum, but this game has shooting mechanics which revolve around RNG. First is bloom (how much the bullets spread while spraying) which is fine to have as RNG, but the other is damage - I have been in countless situations where I have head shot someone with a Para (one of the highest damage rifles which is usually a 1 hit head shot) but then die because he didn't die but sprayed 2 AK47 bullets (a lower damage rifle) into my stomach. In short, head shots are not rewarded sufficiently in this game.   - Updates, in short, there is a lack of new content in new updates, it revolves around the pay-to-play whales where they are given new weapons to pay for (and at an obscene amount too).   Do not waste your time with this game, the community is pure cancer, they are the most stupid people you will ever come across in your life. One last thing you should know is that even if this game has 5000 active players (which is a very high estimate), the most recent public cheat had something like 3500+ downloads if I recall correctly.",0
"Playing this game for about five years going on six and seeing the different changes that have affected this game makes me ashamed of how long I've played this game, I have developed many perspectives for this game. Playing when IJJI had the game was when A.V.A was at its prime, back when the guns actually took skill to use, and how the competitive scene was just being born. But ever since Aeria Games has taken over the game, they have reduced the game to its limit. Milking every dollar they could make, removal of permanent guns and the implementation of timed weapons. Poor server maintenance, etc. First off this game is a fast paced, intense action first person shooter. Second the guns in this game are well made considering most of the guns are based off real guns. (excluding Mega Capsules, Blue tickets, Red Tickets, Etc.) Third, the maps are OKAY, not well made, it's basic maps, some maps are so outdated that they don't even bother fixing the glitches/bugs in most of the maps. (but the maps that are played the most are updated a lot.) Fourth, this games graphics are fairly outdated for the North American version (UAVA), but seeing what the future updates will bring forth has made me more interested in this game. Such as HD textures. Currently in TAVA (Taiwan AVA) they have HD Textures which are considered a huge thing. Fifth, is the competitive scene, back in 2009-2012 the competitive scene was at its best. ieSF was a huge contribution to the competitive scene, they made the players strive towards perfection at this game. But sadly ieSF has stopped including A.V.A in their games list, because of lack of players in the competitive scene. Many of you might know Skadoodle of team iBuyPower from CS:GO, he has played this game professionally and has competed in ieSF, considering this is the first game that he ever played competitively and has achieved the most in. It is sad how the players quit because of the lack of competition because poor anti-cheat, poor game design, etc. All the things I have listed here are mostly cons of why I don't recommend this game. And now I will list the Pros of this game, there are a few dedicated players willing to do whatever it takes to make this game better and improve the amount of players, to have a permanent gun in this game, you had to be playing before they removed the permanent option. If you live near the servers, (Example: Canada) you will have at least 1 ping or 2 depending if you have good internet or not, this game is a really good game to help your aim. It's easy to warm up for games like CS:GO, it will make your aim better, you could have fun playing this game if you play with friends. That pretty much it. Aside from the fact that the people installing this game just for the 'Black Rose' knife in TF2 and then uninstalling this game right after. It installs a keylogger into your system, but it does nothing. I promise you it doesn't do anything to your PC. But uninstalling it without playing it is stupid in my opinion. At least play the game, who knows? Maybe you will end up liking the game and maybe pay money to actually get permanent weapons. Overall my final verdict for this game is 6.5/10, it used to be 9/10 but ever since the heavy impacts it took, I don't recommend this game. Pay 2 Win, used to be balanced. Don't download unless you have played since 2011 and have perm guns. Enjoy!",0
"If I have to be honest, I must say this... Before ♥♥♥♥♥♥ update, it was the best Free-to-play FPS game for older computers. It was something like better Counter Strike. But now, after this update? If you wan't to play this game normally, you need to pay with REAL money, beacuse earning virtual money is ♥♥♥♥IN HARD THING TO DO. In this time, you'll need to repair damaged weapons, grenades, and more... Finally, you don't have any virtual money. Second thing, is that now if you buy OP weapons, you can't buy it for permanent use. You are just buying it for e.g. 30 days. I will say it again. Before this ♥♥♥♥ed update, it was great FPS, but now... Forget about this. It's hosted by Aeria, so... You know... 3/10",0

After not logging in for 6 months, my account that had a list of guns, was reactivated just to find the entire inventory empty... i made a ticket and thought maybe they're was another process to this... apparently aeria says there is no record of me owning anything of a sort... they left me 30k, and the standard starting m4a1, the standard sv98, and an mp5... Everything i had bought with real money, and everything i took the time to acquired was now lost forever, as staff told me... they even told me my account was banned for 'inactivity' and had 'unused ap'. I will never spend another dollar on this game, and will discourage others from playing this game till the day i die.",0

"(Don't underestimate my playtime because I played this game a lot using Aeria Ignite) This game used to be good before Aeria Games made it extremely pay 2 win with huge microtransactions.  4/10.  Edit: I've recently started playing again because of the (re)release of permanent weapons, but my playtime didn't last long. Removing permanent weapons was certainly one of the biggest mistakes Aeria could've made. But even a new release of permanent weapons can't make me recommend this game. The money grab is still everywhere, red/blue ticket system, overpowered fortune weapons, insane prices for permanent AP weapons, bad team balancing, almost no chances for starting players since most players are skilled and of high level, plus: you leave beginner servers way too fast, you're unable to get back to them and you're dropped in high skilled servers, low amount of players &amp; toxic community all contribute to how bad this game still is since Aeria took it from IJJI.",0

"Error: Suspicious program detected! Close all other programs you have running and restart the game.

It doesn't tell you which program is suspicious, but instead asks you to submit a logfile that is not humanly readable, assumably with data about your running processes.

"In the good day of ijji, this game was the best free-to-play fps on the market. Unfortunatly, the compagny gone bankrupt and this game is now manage by aeria wich is the one of the worst money-hungry publisher on the planet.  The bad: All weapon used to be permanant, wich was nice for a free-to-play game, aeria changed that. GIVE US PERM WEAPON BACK! There used to be an update every month, now its more like every holiday. It cost around $200~300 to get some weapons with the tired spender program, wich is too much. Servers are crap and I get net lag even with 5~10 ping Game moderators are mostly absent and support is bad with at best copy/paste robot response. Most weapon you can buy with in-game currency got nerfed over time. Broken in-game chat filter, that is too restrictive and unconfigurable.  The good: Hackers are almost non-existant right now and the only hacker I come across from time to time is a 'fun' hacker. (if that make sense) Nostalgia if you are like me and played for 4~5 years.  Overall, I cannot recommend this game to a new player in its current state. If aeria change, maybe I will review this review one day.",0

"Pros: - Graphics are somewhat decent - Animations are okay - When the people you're playing with aren't hackers or crying children/teenage boys it is a surprisingly bearable shooter.  Cons: - Hacker paradise - Pay-to-win - Confusing as hell menu screen (took me 5 minutes just to figure out how to get into a game lobby) - DLC are WAY too expensive for a F2P game (Seriously, sixty dollars?? Why????) - Gross 'female models' which break the immersion (not that there was much to begin with) - Game frequently disconnects from servers without any real reason (even on a good wired connection) - Game doesn't even run on fullscreen, plays in a weirdly dimensioned window (it did for me at least, I couldn't find any way to change it to fullscreen or a different resolution) - Did I mention hackers?  AVA was honestly not as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as I anticipated it to be, but it's not worth your time. Unless you're after the Black Rose, like I was. If you are, the suffering is worth it. Sort of.  All in all? If you want the Black Rose for your Spy loadout, go for it. But otherwise stay FAR away from this money sucker. Your sanity depends on it.",0

"Holy ♥♥♥♥, even just getting the Black Rose was torture. So first I had to download it which took like 30 minutes, which is fine.

I have to restart Steam to finally play what I was hoping to be a decent shooter, at least good enough to make getting the knife worthwhile. Upon starting up, the framerate was great, and the tutorial was good, which made me have high hopes. I have to play an online match to get my Black Rose. After playing the match I want to kill myself. I am instantly met with like 30 bots on my team I was like (not a good sign), and one actual player. The enemies 30 bots and two players come up to assault us, and it is the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥torm I have ever experienced. To sum it up, its like a Clash of Clans attack, where the enemy, instead of having defenses, has the same amount of troops you do. And everything dies in one hit. Sound fun yet?

You literally have to PAY if you want ANYTHING in this game You can't get permanent weapons in this game, everything is paid content ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers, everyone playing with 1000+ ping even if they live next to the servers The ANTICHEAT doesn't even exist in this game lmao, there's hackers everywhere you go! There's no competitive scene in this game, its just complete and utter trash ranned by random monkeys thinking they're good in this game to host something. The GM's are totally stupid and use copy pastes to help people and don't even read support tickets The GS's aren't even helping they just sit on their ♥♥♥ all day locking threads on the forums instead of doing something helpful for this game like running an in game event. Game is not even balanced, free to play players can't even touch a paid user or a high rank player with their weak guns. The game's engine isn't even being updated and everybody are playing in under 60 fps  Every patch the ram usage of this game increases so the 1GB minimum requirement is a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lie it likes more than 1GB and it will probably burn out your computer if you try this horrible game. This game doesn't even get scheduled content patches. its all random, they decide to add 1 or 2 guns to the game which are only available for REAL MONEY every 2-3 months. They get DDoS attacks every weekend most of the time and the servers are down for over 3 days at weekends Community is trash, you will only get flamed in game if you do something wrong. for example failing a 1vs8 clutch in public. this game has the worst ESL events up to date, no cash prizes only 1 weapon for first place rofl which is clearly impossible to top against those TOP players that win cups every time they ban people for no valid reason they banned more than half the game for an invalid reason such as 'spamming' or 'hacking' or even '3rd party selling' when the owner of the account obviously most likely didn't do in the first place.  Aeria Games destroyed every game so far, this is probably the worst game I've ever played. It was better in 2009-2011 when it was running by a proper company called IJJI This company literally ruined it and turned its potential upside down and took it all the way downhill.

"Warning: this review has been re-uploaded intentionally to not only update new info, but to remove previous ratings due to the review's harsh judgement. I will be reviewing this on my own opinions, although some other opinions are quite the same as mine. Also, I have only played this game for at least a several hours, and has been a long time since then. As a result, the review may not be accurate. Regardless, you've been warned.  A.V.A - Alliance of Valiant Arms is a First-Person Shooter where you choose from one of many classes and..well..kill people. Sound familiar? If many answered Call of Duty, Team Fortress 2, or even Counter Strike, you'd likely be here because it looked cool and all.  'Not all is what it seems.'   Okay, before we dip ourselves into the bad parts of this pool, let's go over the good things I have to say of the game.  + Despite me not liking the artwork this game displays on the store or even the logo, the graphics in this game are pretty good, if not decent. And I must say a lot of effort was put into making the game look nice.  + The game functions well, and I haven't suffered a single crash.  + Hackers about? Not likely. Despite all what people said about  'this game is infested with lifeless hackers!',  I am still having a legitimate experience without suffering any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t such as aimbots, godmode, or any cheats actually. So either they all were ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at some snipers doing some 360 no-scopes, or just wanted to start some rumors on this already down-hill of a game. So in short, not many hackers. That's a plus.  Now, let's list some of the major issues this game has.  - This game is  very  Pay-to-Play influenced. Instead of selling skins and all, there are  actual  weapons being sold as micro-transactions which aren't micro at all. Do you expect me to pay  50$  for a  single  pack of weapons from a Free-to-Play game? No, I wouldn't. It's worse as it encourages people to put money into the game, most recently with the 'Welcome Pack 2016' update.  - The next problem is one people always complain about. People from Team Fortress 2 flock to this game in order to obtain a Spy knife reskin known as 'The Black Rose', a good looking one at that, and was pretty cool before Tough Break came along. To obtain this knife, you simply had to get an achievement in-game. Simple, right? Well, this is where the second flaw comes into play. For some reason..and I mean  for some reason,  the developers thought it was a good idea to prevent you from obtaining any achievements until you beat the  entire  tutorial. You know what that means? You have to sit through an hour or two learning of the game's way of school. And no, not just the basic gameplay. I literally mean  everything.  Only then are you qualified to obtain achievements and obtain 'The Black Rose'. At least, in my experience. When I completed my first round, nothing. However as soon as a beat the tutorial completely, bang! Three achievements, only  one  was the tutorial while the other two was from that previous match. As of me last playing in early 2015, there has yet to be a fix for it other than playing the tutorial like intended.  - From my own experience, the gameplay didn't feel too balanced. The first few lobbys I joined, I went sniper, hence how I'm good with sniping in general. Turns out this Sniper won every game just by camping in a single corner and headshotting everyone on the opposite team while the rest of the team moved up. Even P2Ps who spent 50$+ into the game have fallen before my pathedic F2P Sniper. I don't really intend to try and prove my theory by downloading the game, as it's already 'un-fun' as it is.  - The holy grail to it all is the game's installment. It's files are quite..cruel to other files. In the game's installment, an 'anti-cheat' program is installed that instantly deletes any and all files that the program finds either interfering with the game, and/or because it can. Most cases it was because it could. Why? My Team Fortress 2 graphics looked like they came straight from a missing textured mess from Garry's Mod, and I had to re-install the  entire  game to fix it. Again, this was in my experience. Just uninstall A.V.A once you get what you want from it.  Now with all the major issues out of the way, let's tackle the lesser problems I have with the game.  * The game when launched by steam, launches it's own launcher. It's a small gripe I have. There isn't any real settings to change in said launcher last time I launched it besides maybe screen sizes or fullscreen toggle.  * The community from what I hear is quite..dead. All what's left of it is people probrably hunting for the Black Rose for Team Fortress 2, which by the way, is already losing a good amount of players due to the latest 'Competitive Update'. (I'm looking at you PASS Time..)   Overall, I don't really like this game. While this is a bad game, it isn't  that  bad as people say. The gameplay is decent and the graphics look decent. Just everything is decently good, until the encouragement of 'Pay-to-Play' and bad design choices on terms of coding that made this game fall to the mixed status it is in now.",0
most tactically tactical game 2tactical for my untactical mind,0
"I would give this game about 2.7 stars. It's a bad game, and it should feel bad. I played it for an hour to get the black rose in TF2 (a great game) and just overall didn't like it. Meh graphics, no backstory, no hats, downvote. And I only give it the 2.7 because I had fun laughing at how not good it was.",0
"Tl:Dr- Black Rose is a pretty great knife 10/10. Guns are 2OP4Me for me and gives off a Call Of Duty vibe. Pros: - Free TF2 Knife - Get Holy Mackeral in game (Like it matters if you die every two seconds anyways.) - (Debatable) Has a Hungergames style gamemode Cons: - Download took forever - Might as well play COD - Really Overpowered guns - Community is basically a COD community. (Direspectful, ECT.) - Pay to Win - Not much room to gunplay in maps - Mixed between Reality and Game world (Painted, Alien type guns, with actual guns and Women get less body armor?) - A sexualized game to attract more attention from Male gamers despite gameplay not being good. - They try to lure people to play this game when they just needs major fixing to the game, like make a whole new game or something. which they try to fix and I praise for (They did a survey, although if they listen to peoples results is up to them). Cons overway Pros way more, so in conclusion I will probably have to downvote, Sorry. -Amethyst ",0

"If you played A.V.A. after I.J.J.I. was the publisher, I'm sorry if this game is trash. Aeria Games made this game unbalanced and unfair for the sake of milking what money they can get. They don't care much for you. I had no problems with the old publisher I.J.J.I. Instead of giving you a story worth of words, I'll list the dislike I had with this game After Aeria became publisher.  1. Temporarily disabled permenant guns. 2. Decreased the amount of money for supply drops. (Was 5,000e/Now2,000e)  3. Removed certain armor and equipment from store and removed option to purchase items for less than 30days and removed certain expandible items from store.  4. Replaced lottery guns with tickets. 5. Removed the option to create clan emblems. 6.Turned co-op missions into some cheesy cyfi ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You won't take co-op seriously from what they did to it.  7.Ruin infection mode, which was perfectly balanced by, adding stunning spores (removed), giving every infected spores, giving every infected boost ability (F), removing explosion from mines, adding hints for the host infected, removing gear for extra health for humans in store, removing gear for infected from store.  8. Made unneeded changes to co-op. 9.Removed green boxes from survival. 10. Terrible anticheat. 11. Overall ruined the looks and feels of the game and made it cringy and boring.   Aeria said they'll be leaving, which I'm so happy for. Hopefully the new publisher will fix Aeria's mess.  Want to play a good F2P FPS? Play Warface, Warframe, TF2, or No Room In Hell, or even freaking Combat Arms. I would even recommend Comabat Arms.  ",0
"It's sad to think that this majestic F2P FPS has gone to utter trash. Gone are the days of earning ingame money and purchasing good guns. Now all it is based around is paying to win +the weapons expire after 30days! (WTF). The gameplay is good, but the game is now flooded with exotic 'camo' weapons and stupid items such as fish bats. Seriously, wtf has happened. This is the garbage that made TF2 autistic, and now this game? In conclusion, stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from this game unless you're a 12 year old Filipino kid who is willing to buy guns every week. (no hate on any race)",0

"My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.",0

"AVA Had the most interesting and skill based weapon control + recoil mechanics of any shooter in the genre. And then Aeria came along and ♥♥♥♥ed everything over.  Forget the potential of wasting money on this game, or the fact that weapons have made this game incredibly P2W since the para nerf; the customer service alone is reason enough reason that this game has gone to utter ♥♥♥♥. The game rewards weapons that are just point and spray instead of requiring any real skill to use.  After taking a break from the game for many months, I log in to find out that my STEAM ID has been banned from the servers, when I asked Aeria why they refused to give me any information, they just copy and pasted nonsense about sending them the last 5 transaction ID's plus 6 other rediculous questions that I couldn't possibly answer to get my account back.  0/10 will not Aeria ever again.",0
"They call it Free2Play; I call it Free until you reach the point where you realize you need to put in real money to make any meaningful progress. The first 10 levels was fun, especially in the Beginner Channel which is limited to level 1-5/1-10. Next, you're in the Public Channel without level limits; the territory of people who dedicate serious time and real money. Later on, trying to earn game money is almost pointless, so you'll have to put in real money if you want to buy stuff and stay competitive. It'd be better if there were more level specific Channels like 1-15; 1-20; etc. Be prepared to get insta-killed... a lot. You will run into hackers. If you press ESC during a game, it shows three things: disconnect; cancel; REPORT HACKER. That shows how much of an issue it is. Auto Balance is terrible.

"Alliance of Valiant Arms is an example of a Pay2Win game. By spending an average amount, you get so much stuff, it will easily over-power anyone who has payed nothing. The sniper rifles are extremely cheap. When using a sniper rifle, once a shot is fired, you can switch to another weapon and then switch back by quickly hitting the q button twice, its like an OP DMR that can one shot anyone under any circumstances. It takes too much time to rank up, and you cannot purchase anything until Rank 8. This will have you stuck with default items for ages. And the ONE thing that made me quit this game is none other than the god forsaken time trails!!! They suck, they are impractical, and just ruins your day when all of your weapons suddenly dissapear. Otherwise, the game is decent in every other perspective. The graphics are nice, controls are smooth, maps and gamemodes are acceptable and even unique in some cases, like Escape (Though Zombie modes suck). Without those, the only thing it has running for it is that its not Combat Arms.",0

DO NOT download this game, at all costs. It's p2w, so it's not worth it. If you already have it, then uninstall it. Don't let Aeria steal your time, money, and/or bandwidth.

"I played this game in the summer of 2011. But, not on steam. On Aeria Games (or that's how I think you spell it)  Anyway, when I first played this game, I instantly thought it was Pay2Win. It was.  But, I gave this game a try. I played this game for hours.  I forgot it was Pay2Win because I played so many events and I earned so many Euros(but mostly from people helping me out, also Euros are in-game money). ______________________________________________________________________ Why was it Pay2Win?  You had to REPAIR your gun. (costs money) You had to RENT the most OP guns. (costs money) You always fought EXTREME PROFESSIONALS ALL THE TIME (well, it really depends). ______________________________________________________________________ Don't get me started on infection mode. Infection mode is basically zombies (players) vs. other players. It was SO hard to kill one single zombie. I wasted all my ammo on one single zombie every game. You couldn't even kill someone as a zombie, so many PROFESSIONALS ._.  There is a rank system, and it was rare to encounter a horrible high-ranked player. Also, there were lots of hackers back then. ______________________________________________________________________  I forgot all about this game.

This is the worst example of a shooter I have seen in a long time; It is Pay2Win, begs you to buy its overpriced ingame credits to buy weapon reskins and extremely overpowered buffs and weapons and steals from other bad games like Call of Duty. The major design flaw in this game is the concept itself, and Valve should feel ashamed to link a Team Fortress 2 promotion to this pile of raw waste. I can see the appeal this game would have to some people with a far below average IQ, but it doesn't hold up to people that want to actually have fun with their games.

"One of the Worst games I have ever played, the gameplay is repetative and offers nothing diffrent from your normal fps. Scernarios especially are repetative has you usally just move through area to area shooting AI enemys which are so stupid they just charge your postition and get mowed down over and over till you find your objective or get to the end of the area. Sure occasinaly you get a guy armed with an rpg who just stands still and fires it over and over at you but that's it AI wise. To say this game has coop is insulting, it was so repetative that I didn't even want to play more than 1 macth of the coop, If i want good coop I would go play Payday 2 sure it costs money to buy it but at least it works with no problems and is fun. Did I mention I had to reboot the game TWICE after booting it up once just to get into 1 macth...1 ♥♥♥♥ING macth. So that's what 3 times I had to boot the game up just to get into 1 macth. Not to mention the so called charecter customization is bare bones has hell only allowing you to choose a face for your guy, which you won't even ♥♥♥♥ing see ever, since the game is played in First Person. Hell even when looking at other peolpes charecters you cna barely see they face anyway, not to mention most of them look the same, most of the faces look the SAME. I played this game for less than 20 minutes and I already don't wish to ever play this game again. Please do yourself a favor and dont even download this piece of ♥♥♥♥ attempt at making a game. The coop is repetative has hell, you will often find yourself doing the same thing over and over in very similiar looking areas making you wonder if you went in a circle or if your going backwards because you cant tell it all looks the same. The Competative multiplayer sucks ♥♥♥, and the game lags like hell and no the lag was not me I turned my settings down to low just to see if it was me, and I still lagged like ♥♥♥♥. With all that and barebones 'Charecter Customizeation' this game even if its free to play is not worth downloading, and if you spent any money on this game I feel sorry for you it really wasn't worth it. Anyway if I were to give this game a rating it would be a 1/10 but after some really ♥♥♥♥ing hard thought I am gonna give it a 2/10 for at least looking like its trying to be a good game. It looks like its actually trying it really does, but it just is so bad and so repatative that I don't see myself or many over peolpe playing this game for more than a few minutes. Summary Good:Free to play Bad: Repetative Coop Missons, Lag out the ♥♥♥, Charecter Customizing is barebones, Competive Multiplaye itself offers nothing new and gets repetative, Is horrandusly boring and Repetative compared to other coop games, Game itself seems to not offer anything new.",0

"This game is not freemium.  It's COMPLETELY pay to win. Getting stomped because you just start and fall against people with better gun and armor in pubs is disgusting. Go play something else, there's far better out there to invest time into.",0
"Ahoi in the F2P zone. 1. 'trailer' is fake,they use aimbot in it.  2. Yeah you can do all of that amazing stuff, for now (only for you) only 100 dollars. There are 2 type of 'players' Wallet-Fighter : Buys anything,do dominate you. Aimbot kids : They don't buy anything,they often under 12 and they just use aimbot. I remeber,when this game was good. It is an another game now. Please,don't even try it.",0
Crashing for some time now. Got the game for a TF2 knife. -10/10 would crash for another knife.,0
"Activision approves.Money-Maker Simulator of the year.No,now seriously,this game has SO many flaws,bugs,pay2win aspects and lags,that I would even consider it as one of THE worst F2P titles I´ve ever seen.And,just as a hint:This game installs freaking spyware onto your computer!Don´t believe?Thats alright.But just watch out,you don´t want your personal informations get into the wrong hands.",0
This was AMAZING and not a pay-to-win game before they switched to Aeria Games. Now its only purpose is to give profit to those ♥♥♥♥♥. Before: highly recommended Now: don't even look at it,0
ruined by aeria games,0
"I do not recommend this game to anyone. Those 3 hours you see there in my playtime are just downloading patches, which would have errors again and again. About 3 gb of space to download the 'game' then the patches, it is really irritaiting. Please, unless you really want that TF2 knife, like really, really, want it. Go for it and get it, just skip the tutorial and go straight to a game which is about to end to get the achievment ASAP. Otherwise, do not play it if you want to pay and be bombed with endless ads of buy this buy that, endless downloading, making an account just to play, poor tutorials, forced windowed mode, I do not want anyone playing this mess.",0
kinda laggy and the maps are really small,0
"Don't download this, I just came here for the TF2 knife, you can get better than a crappy Counter Strike ripoff.",0
This is STOOPID! But I did get 'The Black Rose' out of it so I would only get this if you want an awesome Spy knife.,0
eh i guess its okay. NOT,0
Literaly only got this game to game the Black Rose in TF2  Played it for abit  Found it rubbish  Got my knife  Deinstalled it,0
"  If i dont reccomend this game, then why have i played it for more than an hour? You might be wondering. Try playing it. Enough said.            (P00TiS!)",0
used to be a good game....,0
This game sucks.  Get it for the Black Rose for TF2 and then uninstall.,0
Such a crappy game. Delete it from Steam please. Pay to win at it's maximum. Never saw such a unbalanced game between people who play for free and people who pay for weapons.,0
"i did it for a tf2 item lol, the games ♥♥♥♥ also btw",0
complete utterly ♥♥♥♥ and if anyone wants some good accounts i have some for sale for csgo skins,0
10/10 Would throw grenades again.,0
This game is ♥♥♥♥ literally has no game it crashes on the first level and again doesn't even work don't play it,0
we are all here for the black rose aren't we?,0
"It took me 33 hours to get the game to work after updating, just to get a tf2 knife.",0
"Alliance of Valiant Arms was an enjoyable game before Aeria Games came along. These new operators installed pay2win mechanics and microtransactions everywhere. Even when you do pay real money for a weapon it's now only for a limited time. Seriously. You don't even get to keep the items you pay REAL MONEY for.  I'd recommend this game if you could go back in time to before Aeria Games took over, but since that seems very unlikely this one is a big no-no for me.   the free tf2 knife is nice though",0
If you have alot of money to spend play this. If you dont then get ready to be beaten by some P2Winners,0
Not worth it. Too many hackers and exploits.,0
BST GAYME EVR 11/10 JUST LIKE COD. WHAT IS TF100? LEL,0
"That game was great until Aeria took it over, then it turned to garbage. Having to buy guns for a limited time, having to use cash to get anything remotely decent. They should have just left it it Ijji.",0
"Played it before and thought it was ok, untill Aria games took over.  Now I wont even look at it. DO NOT support this game it will take your money and never even attempt to improve itself.",0
this game is broken as FxCK. dont install it. your PC will crash,0
"This game is so pay-to-win, it's laughable.   If you want a more enjoyable option, go buy CS:GO. Or if you REALLY don't want to pay money and want to shoot things, there's Soldier Front 2. Planetside 2 is another option for that, but it's a whole different beast.  There are a variety of game modes, a la Counter-Strike and CoD deathmatch. However, the hitreg is bad, there's a ton of blatant cheaters...and you literally need to BUY guns and equipment with real money to keep playing the game.  So...should you download this game?  Yes. Because you can get a pretty looking knife for the Spy in TF2. For free. Seriously, just download it, play a match, and you get it.  Then you can uninstall this game and forget it ever existed.",0
this game is cancer,0
Never play this game.,0
"1.) If you play TF2, get it just because you get the Black Rose for the Spy (Which is just a retexture of the normal Knife, along with 2 different Styles) 2.) I joined a game and the only thought I had was 'Is this game supposed to be ♥♥♥♥♥'. After reading some of the others reviews it seems like an overall fun game, and I'm sure you'd like to read those rather than reading my review. 4/10, +4 for Effort.",0
"Awsome like COD online but a lot better. This one is actuly updated and 100% freeer. (edit) Its slipped a lot since then, its overdone the p2w thing, and the overall game quality has slipped. no longer reccomending, not worth the download anymore. Though if you download for the tf2 knife its worth trying to see if you like it for a short period but dont waste long on it and also i suspect they have powered down the servers as the game is generally more laggy and slower, also when aeria took over instead of fixing a glitch they just closed the map as it was a co-op level and the glitch allowed people to get an item as a f2p player that they intended only p2p players to be able to get, thats the ethos aeria has money. The game overall now feels (the europe+usa version at least) that it is only still running to squeeze the remaining money out of the remaining core players.  ALSO SOME ADVICE: If you have ever installed this game then uninstalled and have no intent of playing again or playing another game that uses game guard, the games anti-cheat engine, which is ironically a minor security threat dosent uninstall, if a hacker tried to get into your pc they could make it a threat so i would advise googling how to propery uninstall gameguard. While you have the game installed this is not a problem because it will update, but once the game is uninstalled it will not update if new security risks emerge so could become a problem.  Edit, ava has recently been acuired by a new company that bought areia, will see if anything changes and update this review if any significant changes come to my attention. (edit) Nope.",0
Have fun with that keylogger!,0
Load of crap.,0
"Before you get this don't do it.This game USED to be a good game,well until....Aeria games came in and ruined it!All gameplay and engine were working fine but Aeria games changed everything.I Would recommend this IF Aeria games did not came in.If anyone reads this,It will be YOUR PICK if you get this game or not.Thanks for who reads this.",0
Literally the worst game of all time.,0
"Temporary guns, game crashes, general bad game. Got it for the TF2 item. Looked around in it for a while. Game sucks.",0
"Used to be good and fun, now its ruined and is entirely pay to win.",0
"another multiplayer only game reminisce of CS:GO and others but with a confusing menu and toxic playerbase. the game didnt allow for a full screen mode (or if there was an option to do, there was no clear options button to poke around at). for a new player, I was immediately latched onto by the games resident a-holes to 'kick the ducky, kick the ducky' (Ducky being the term given to a new player as their badge is that of a duck) so there wasnt much encouragement to keep playing. as for the games interface as well, there were so many buttons and things to do, invintory, items, that while a smart person can figure it out with a bit of patience, a less so person would be wholly overwhelmed by what to do or how to do it. The only thing that kept me playing through an entire round was the tf2 item you get for one of the achievements. I give this game the old Pass.",0
"I used to play this game when ijji ran it. For the most part, it was a fun alternative to CoD and leagues ahead of Combat Arms. But as the years dragged on, the toxicity of this specific gaming comunity coupled with the rampant cheaters led to the decline of this once great game.",0
Just my favorite game,0
great game i got a nice TF2 weapon out of it. I would play this again but too many hackers and too many tryhards,0
"Ahh yes, AVA. I played my fair share over the years. Spent a little money now and again, Decided to jump into a game after about a year, Faced three hackers, Uninstalled.",0
this game isn't very good the only reason i got it was to get the black rose and i did what i needed to do to get it and i don't even get it ,0
Glad to know that this game has an uninstall feature.,0

black rose and then gt*o,0
I played this game back in 2011 when it was owned by a different dev studio. Afterwards it was bought by AeriaGames and it has became a horrible mess of a game with nothing but in game purchases for pay to win and a terrible experience not to mention the dated graphics don't help it.  2/10 don't play it.,0
"watches a video on how to get the black rose, installs it, gets achievment then unistalls it admit it we only installed this game for the black rose",0
This game sucks!,0
"cons: buggy as ♥♥♥♥, pay to win, just a cs reskin pros: get the black rose knife in tf2 after you create a character and play a game, nothing else so ♥♥♥♥ing uninstall after you get that knife",0
4 tries to just get on the game      crash simulator 2015,0
i never played the game....but when an update is downloaded that makes my antivirus react then its 'bye bye' for this game....,0
"A.V.A begginers guide : 1.Install the game. 2.PLay your first game by goin all commando and having a - k/d ratio after you skip the stupid tutorial. 3.Congratz, you have your first TF2 Spy skin - Black Rose... Im proud of you ! 4.Uninstall it and run antivirus",0
"To tell you that this is good? Well, if you like old graphics and a game like CS:GO then this is your game. Though the only thing about this game that I don't like is when you download it. It may look like it's just downloading the game, but it is also downloading a anit cheat in you pc or whatever you have. This anti cheat thing would scand your profile from what I have heard. Don't trust me? Look it.   Sum it up, downloads a thing in your pc that you don't want which sees what you do on steam and is hard to uninstall it.",0
Step 1: install game Step 2: complete a full round Step 3: exit game and uninstall Step 4: go into tf2 and obtain reskin of knife Step 5: re-install windows because this game probably gave you numerous viruses,0
downloaded AVA Wasted half an hour to get 1 achievement deleted the game  started tf2 get the black rose ,0
Only for blackrose...,0
"Got the game wanting the TF2 'Black Rose' Item. Took an hour to download, froze a bunch, and played in window mode during the tutorial. Eventually skipped tutorial on accident trying to go into full screen, then attempted to join a game and get it over with quickly. Got killed ten times, didn't know how to complete the mission, and after 2 tries I s̶a̶i̶d̶ ̶♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶u̶s̶e̶d̶ ̶S̶A̶M̶ finally got the achievement. 10/10 would make an over-used review for it again.",0
"Im got it just to get the TF2 items, but i still havent been able to play the actual game. It keeps crashing, the account making is so bad i thought it was a virus at first, and it sometimes just stops working. They actually had to pay me to play it, with the knife from TF2.",0
this game doesnt really work well,0
"After reading the reviews I thought I'd at least give the game a shot and this is what I found. Constantly went into not responding even if I clicked settings, my first few games and people were cussing at me because I was new and didn't know what I was doing too well, a lot of pay to play/win elements. After this and a few games I knew that this game.....was getting uninstalled.",0
game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks wont even start up right and when it does it crashes and gives me a ♥♥♥♥ing suspectful program running error when there is no other programs running good job achievement unlocked made ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.,0
This game is crap. Just buy a real shooter,0
THE LAG IS REAL,0
"Honestly, Like Everyone here, I only got it for the TF2 weapon....BUT IT WAS SO ♥♥♥♥ING HARD WITH THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GLITCHS! I COULDNT PLAY! THE GUYS FACE STAYED IN ONE PLACE AND HIS BODY MOVED.....11/10 would play again",0
"This game sucks.   1st point: its pay to win. pure and simple.  2nd point: its full of hackers, aeria does nothing about it, since you spend a lot of money.  3rd point: if you dont spend money, its very hard to play, in-game currency is hard to get, and everything that you can use to get the game easier for you, is expencive.  This game was good, a few years ago before AERIA GAMES took over. now it just sucks.",0
It's a horribe i can't even play it caus it don't work the severs are very bad and bad graphics and the guns suck to the game sould not be on steam it's that bad.,0
"The game wont open, it says other programs are not allowing it to play",0
"I downloaded this just to get a knife in TF2. Big mistake! This game made me almost cry out of frustration and disgust. It is horrible and i want nothing to do with it ever again. I am glad that i won the first game i ever played on it so that i never have to play it again.  when you open it you are welcomed by a windowed launcher that stops responding every 10 seconds. It´s almost like the computer wants nothing to do with it. My antivirus protection popped up and told me it looked suspicious and asked me if i was ok with it running on the computer or if it should terminate it.  I can tell you that the gameplay is ♥♥♥♥ too! I laughed my way throught this experience whilst almost crying because its so horrible. How can you actually make something this broken and ♥♥♥♥♥♥!? The only reason anyone would want to play it is because you might get a weapon for another game, unless you kill yourself before winning a game that is.  Warning! If you don´t want to risk your life to get a weapon in TF2 don´t install this peice of S@#t",0
10/10 Fastest Uninstall Ever.  Pros: Get cool TF2 item  Cons: Everything else Pay 2 Win Install-Uninstall time,0
"Joined a 'New Player' room and was kicked; literally 1 round later; because I was deemed 'New' and had no idea of the map layout. A player, who shall remain anonamous, told me to go f**k myself because I was 'bad'. Happened withing 10 min upon completion of the tutorial. Community is almost as good as League of Legends.",0
It was good until Aeria ramped up the P2W.,0
really really bad  thanks for the knife  ps the tank game is very unfair  ok done bye,0
Only good if you played it before IJJI went down the hole... Those were the good days.. Now is only good for a unique knife in TF2..,0
This game is good at first but now itz full of fat-gotz and pay2win,0
"I tried playing this game a long time ago. Buggy Mess, crashed several times, Pay 2 win, bla bla bla, its not very good  (Through Gunz: The Duel is still quite awesome. same creator)",0
"I would recomend But theres way to many downfalls to this use to be good game. Its mainly Paytowin, Hackers own the game from time to time. The game is fun but Fps is terrible for an old game. The company aeria is not customer friendly and is very careless in the way they run the game. Id rate it a 50 50 Give it a try but theres better games out there.",0
"Good game but not so friendly, filled with rage players and noobs just got kicked from the game by VIP players quickly. Although I don't want to say this, Its P2W. Some people might say that skill rules in FPS but I wanna say that if you pay then you would get the armors or guns with both better attributes than credit ones, and those premium items can't be farmed by any means in game, you got to pay if you wanna be stronger and beat the players at the same skill level, thus this breaks the F2P meaning from the just begining.",0
"I only downloaded this for the free Black Rose item.   Could not even get to the login page to make an account, because the page kept crashing/  gg.  Edit: after allowing the game to waste 15 minutes in a special snowglobe download process, I finally got a pop up reading some memory card gibberish about reading a file. I decided to look into the local files and discover why the game wasn't playing on my damn screen. Found the app launcher, and clicked it.  Got a message stating 'this game needs _______ blank download to play'.  No, screw that. My computer is in a shoddy state, I don't need more freeware ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t infecting my computer, I shouldn't have to wait so long for a download, I should NOT have to look for extra crap just to play the game.  Deleted. Done. Keep your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ knife.",0
my only regret is having the game on my recently played list,0
If you can get past the loading screen for the tutorial I applaud you. Slowly applaud you.,0
"okay for free, if you have the money get ether cs go or cs source apparently people still play that game. ",0
lol no.  Just get the knife and then uninstall it.,0
"Ok, I liked it. They banned my account though, with no real reasoning. therefore I won't get to play this game again, and the same has happened for many many others. It's fun but they don't let you have your account back after its banned.  This includes ANY money spent on that account.",0
"I hoe you guys know what you're heading in to get this knife : big troubles. Cons :  Well, you have to plan a full day for it, starting with the downloading time (2 hours), the updating time (30 minutes), the playtime (15 minutes), and the unistalling time (3 hours, because nGameProtect makes your computer laggy as hell, because I think this game was made by Satan himself). You can easily find tutorials on how to completely remove it on Internet, but following the instructions is another story. Not that you're all idiots, just that your computer need 5 minutes to allow you to click on something. Each time. I advise you to create shortcuts where you need to go to unistall it, because once downloaded, you're dead. Or you'll eat your 80th birthday cake in front of your screen.  Pros :  Well, you've just proved you were ready to do anything to have a free TF2 item, so people will respect you for this so long and painful day, or just laugh at you. But in this case, you can still stab them to death with style.  (Do Not) Enjoy !",0
Hahahahah No. It sucks. I played it for the TF2 Achievment Item. ￣ω￣,0
"Joined, died, left, got Black Rose. Thanks.  The game itself looks like archaic trash, though",0
this game has a lot of bugs like when I started the game and I exited and now it said it was running but now I have to restart my computer to get it to stop running. p.s. no I can't go offline,0
"After taking a break from the game I wanted to pick it up again. Now it seems I can't reconnect to my old profile. Why can't my Steam login function as login for the game? Why does it have to be an external, crappy, complicated login system? I lost my progress and also weapons that I won in the in-game lottery (aka worth real money). Be careful not f*ck up your profile/login.  As for the rest of the game: it's sloppy but fun. Fun enough to keep me going for 100+ hours, admittedly. Yet there's better games to spend your time on, especially if you're playing solo - A.V.A was only fun to me because I played it with 2-3 friends most of the time.",0
"Timed weapons, lack of publisher support, and Brazilian overload. Flooded with hispanics and Brazilians, and although I have nothing against them, they are a terrible community of gamers. They have terrible ping. Then there's Aeria Games, whose greed basically overrides any sense of progress in the game's development. Aeria even stooped as far as to change one of the features that made this game good: permanent weapons. This feature set the game above most if not all other F2P FPS games out there, and Aeria took this away because of greed.  Overall, I'd rate this game 9/11, would Jihad again.  EDIT:  They brought back permanent weapons. Still wouldn't recommend it though.",0
i installed the game but there is always an error message showing up everytime i try to play it. all the rest of my games work but this one. it looks fun but i can not play it due to a stupid error message. 10/10 would uninstall again,0
"installed it.registered it. press play game, tells me access denied and tells me to register again, i enter my login info it does nothing...uninstalled it. f**k the game.",0
don't even bother downloading through steam. its considered as a hack to them. they just banned me for using steam app. i played this game through the steam app and i got banned for 'Hacking',0
I can't even get it to start through steam. Keeps saying 'SteamAPI_Init() failed. LastError = 87' The only real reson i've heard of this game is because th Black Rose is a promo item for it. And that doesn't even work! IDK whats going on but more trouble than it's worth for me atleast.,0
"It's Pay 2 Win, got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, horrible playerbase, horrible maps, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay mechanics, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ balance, very grindy, and ♥♥♥♥ I don't even want the black rose. Go online and get yourself a better knife skin m8. Also don't give your email to aeria. Doesn't even support multiple accounts on the same steam profile.",0

"Well where can i start... pay to win , spray and pray and servers laggy as possible hmmm what i have seen playing many shooters i believe i have a right to say my thoughts even if i have played for atleast half an hour was people with guns that killed you instantly and all i could do was hope to kill by litrally throwing my body in to get kills . but i will have to emit there was something i did check up on before playing this the company who bought this game reuined it for the majority of old players which made me edgey . AS the game is quite old i can say for what it is it feels alright and it had something nice about it but Pay 2 win, Spray and pray, bad latency issues i would only recommend if you have a true passion for this game . Then again this intrested me for the Black Rose in TF2. But i would thank you for reading this only try this game if your willing to put up with this.",0
"This game can be incredibly hard to get running. That should be enough just to steer away from it. I tried everything in my power to get this bloody game working, and it went to nothing. The 17 minutes I have playing this game was from me just staring at the error I got every time I tried to boot it up. Going to the site's forums to figure out how to get this game to actually work, and doing everything I was told to do, my internet security told me to stay away from it once I actually got to the bootup menu.  0/10.  Not a plesant expirence.",0
I played this game just to get a weapon in tf2.,0
"At first, this game seemed very promising. But, it failed to deliver. The combat is frusterating and the controls are hard to configure if you aren't happy with the standard FPS bindings (for example, you can't bind any controls to the keypad [the numbers on the right of the keyboard] if you are right handed). The only reason you should get the game is because of The Black Rose for Spy in TF2. It's like this game is basically holding the awesome item hostage. So, 2/10 for the game itself, 9/10 for the Black Rose you get from this abomination.",0
"Simply put = it's awful. The FPS F2P genre can only be done so well (TF2) and this is not a good example of that. Microtransactions everywhere, horrible UI, horrible GAMEPLAY and just not worth your time. Also only reason I got it was for the TF2 item.",0

"This game is terrible. Guns have little to no recoil, making mowing down the enite team alone incredibly easy for one guy to do. The side-arms, grenades, and knives, are totally pointless and ineffective, and they contiue to be so even if you remove the previous fact. This game tries way too hard to be good, which it isn't, and imitates better games like Counter Strike. It even takes the stupid 'medals' awarded to players for different kills, such as grenade kills, from Call of Duty. Some other reviewer down there said it was a better version of CS, at least in the past. HELL no. I didn't even touch the micro-transactions, which are EVERYWHERE by the way! The ONLY reason you should EVER play this game is to get the Black Rose on TF2. I am actually ashamed to have this display on my profile. The only reason it's on there is because I wanted the Black Rose on TF2. If you want a good F2P game, go play Team Fortress 2.",0
"P2W (Pay 2 Win) games suck! This game used to be amazing back in the day way before they released it on Steam. I used to play this a TON!!!   Why can't more devs be like they are on Path Of Exile and make money with small micro transactions where if you pay real money for something, it will never increase your stats at all but only make your equips look better.  I know that some other game developers have done the same as POE and they are in fact making great money on their games, but anyway, I cannot recommend A.V.A plus OMG the sad cheaters that ruin the game are way too many to handle.

"Was a great game, too bad it installs ♥♥♥♥ING ROOTKITS",0
This game is complete crap. Since Aeria Games bought it out from IJJI it's gotten worse. The game is easily a pay 2 win game.,0
My Black Rose experience. 1. Played 3 bot rounds 2. Was confused 3. Played a normal round 4. Get Black Rose 5. Leave  -420/69 would get promo item again -IGN ,0
"Sooooo Wow Guys  Just  Wow Those three hours of play time? They were spent loading and downloading this game.  Playing was like, ten minutes. This is unbelievable. Nothing but spawn camping and attempts at being CS:GO with half the coding devoted to microtransactions and jiggle physics.  Final verdict: Download, Get Black Rose, Delete.",0
step 1: get the black rose  step 2: uninstall  congrats you won,0
"Its not a super bad game, it seems kinda fun. But, my first and only match had 3 hackers all on the same team. Thats not very fun. I'm gonna uninstall it, i only installed it for the Black Rose.",0
"Gets the Black Rose on TF2 so there's that. +1 Good Everything else un-fun to me, and so much pay to win/ play it's unbearable. - However much of that there is.",0
  A Dead FPS Shooter,0
more like alliance of Valiant farms,0
I just wanted the black rose.... BUT it took 2 hours to download updates after the additional 5 hour download,0
I couldnt even get the game to ♥♥♥♥ing run. Extremely laggy and i have an amazing PC. Trying to change graphics makes the game stop responding or just crash all together. 10/10 would remove.,0
Pure garbage. Played purley for the tf2 knife. Absolute ♥♥♥♥ game,0
"Don't get it.   Personally, I installed it for the Black Rose knife in TF2, which is probably the only reason why you would get it. Don't even install it for that, as it installs a rootkit (annoying as f**k to remove). Other from that, hit registration is horrible, cheaters on most servers, and the most evidently greedy Pay-to-Win system I've ever seen in a game (hopefully I won't see any more). Don't get it, unless you want the Black Rose in TF2, and even if you do install it for the knife, make sure to uninstall the rootkit as well. ",0
dose anyone know how to conect to this game it dosent work to me ;_; ,0
im not sure if i would recommend it because it won't connect or even load. ,0
"This game is an outadted cs:go, call of duty or whatever fps shooter you want clone that is only worth getting for the knife in Tf2. Even tho it is nice for the free steam item i would recomend considering the hell that is called the first mission you need to go trouhg. Free knife tho",0
"Ugh. Lets all just say it. You are here so you can get the TF2 item.  Let's break down how terrible this game is.  There is a complete lack of good graphics, and frankly ugly. The controls are awkward and random, making the understanding of the controls awkward. There is a frame rate issue that I couldn't fix, not because my system can't play it, but because it is just poorly created and rendered.  The game doesn't go fullscreen, it has this halfway point which it sticks at. Oh, and headshots don't kill....? The tutorial was long and unclear, with poor audio. The game looks about an tenth as good as the trailer, it really is a waste of time. The main menu was confusing and poorly formatted, making it difficult to even find the tutorial missions.  The game itself crashed several times. For no reason whatsoever.  Overall I recommend this game to no one. This is the worst game I have ever played on Steam. Hands down.",0
Its a Pay-to-Win (like some call of duty games) It focuses on female character boob physics lacking the budget for better graphics and hacking prevention. Its....Kinda bland. Theres hardly anything much to do then just sit there and stare at the boob physics. There are constant hackers which prevents anything being done. Did I mention they also kinda removed Permanent Weapons a little? I would recemend just getting the game for the knife to Tf2 (Black Rose) or! Learn fluent Korean from the game. Overall basically a 5$ budget call of duty. I deleted it for space on my disk.,0

The game has great potential but is so heavily pay to win that i don't think i can recommend it anymore.,0
didn't use it on steam before so don't look at my hours. spent well over 1000 hours. used to be one of the best fps games. aeria destroyed it. ggwp,0
This game to me-  Hears you can get a TF2 item from it Downloads Starts up(Takes a good minitue or two) Instantly launched into a tutorial that I can't skip Finishes tutorial Goes into a game Takes 5 minitues to load teams for that game Quits that game to find another one Takes 2 minitues Notices that this game is a CS:GO ripoff Gets the TF2 item achievement Quits game Uninstalls,0
the doesn't work at all everytime i hit start game it stops responding dont even bother getting this,0
"This is the WORST ♥♥♥♥ING GAME EVER...EVEEEER - Updates 3 hours - No options in-game - Graphics are bad - It's plain boring - The hit registry is the best ever, maybe even better than in Minecraft I am here just for the TF2 knife  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Yay after 108 minutes it ♥♥♥♥ING WORKED, the achievement worked At first I was like -  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  But then -  ( ͡⊙ ͜ʖ ͡⊙)  Then a little later after that -  ( ͡◉ ͜ʖ ͡◉)﻿  And then i deleted this game...   0 / 10 Never playing this piece of ♥♥♥♥ again",0
"  At first A.V.A was great before the company change, but now it's not as fun as it used to. I also saw one review saying that it's a CS:GO knockoff, IT WAS BEFORE CS:GO",0
"at one time, this game was fun but now they have become the worst game creators do not care to virus protections says that the game is virus why should a game that is 'virus' need to be on steam plz fix? ",0
"Sadly, the game is rather mundane, it's a grinder, it's not very rewarding, and the gameplay is less than satisfying. I wouldn't bother with downloading it.",0
"Overall rating: 3/10  Was such an amazing game when i was younger, now it's Pay to win and they're just looking for profit, i miss this a game a ton, sadly don't want to see anymore of it  Final thoughts: Great elements every shooter needs, but where the developers decided to bring this, ruined it all. I would have recommended this a while back, but not now.",0
JUST BUY COUNTERSTRIKE  btw nice tf2 knife  easiest unistall ever,0
"This game actually cointain an keylogger, i think.",0
"very bad game . The community is Sh!t. You get called a noob if you don't win in a clutch . If you're not getting a lot of kills like everyone else YOU WILL BE KICKED. They will spam ' 5 ' in chat meaning you're going to get kicked. The Company IS MESSED UP. The game looks like an arcade shooter with all of those cheesy childish skins.   Clan wars are only in EU servers which will MAKE YOU LAG . There's no one in NA playing Clan wars.  HACKERS... A LOT OF CHEATERS with UAV and the best part is they claim they're on their 'alt'.   Overall it's a toxic and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game . Save your blood pressure and play a better game , CSGO is the way to go. My rating : 4.5/10",0
"AVA eh? A complete waste of time. Do NOT download this. In my case, I cannot even connect to the AVA servers. As soon as it tries to connect right after the 10 minute start up, it instantly, no exxageration, INSTANTLY fails to connect and closes. No retries, just disapointment. If you are here for the black rose, just remember to uninstall after getting the achievement.",0
"This game used to be great, till the company it belonged too I think sold it to another company, and now its ♥♥♥♥ since all they focus on is milking every penny of this great game. My first ever game.",0
"I love how the FREE package is given if you BUY, let me repeat, BUY in-game money. Aeria, stahp.",0
"I played this game when the beta came out a couple years ago. Used to be a rad game, It had Hide &amp; Seek with sweet zombies. Now there's like 4 people playing total, and it's all on the boring gametypes.",0
IT DOES NOT WORK ,0
Used to be good until IJJI sold the rights to Aeria. Now the game won't even launch because of some error.,0
"Do not get this game unless you are trying to get the Black Rose in TF2. It is basically a CoD/CS:GO clone, except it takes absolutely no skill.",0
P2W game 2015 only got for knife,0
It ♥♥♥♥ing sucks,0
It was okay... rather laggy fairly bad graphics and most things didn't work... but it is free.,0
"Ok shooter, a lot of annoyances. Maps especially are incredibly uncreative. So far most of them are perfect mirror images. Also, a fixed spawn point - you know where the enemy will span. Most battles devolve into a 10 minute fight over the same hallway. But it is free...",0
"4.5/10 This game used to be absolutely stunning during its IJJI era. I've started playing this game way back in around 2008-2009 before it was even on Steam, so my hours are far more than what I actually have on Steam. There used to be a lot more players, a healthier community, and a lot less hackers. Now, it's simply pay2win and full of trash talkers/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players. Although the gameplay itself has not changed much in the past years, the state of the game has deteriorated significantly. With the removal of permanent guns a couple of years ago, it has only gotten worst. The company releases OP guns that cost real money, and most of the time they aren't even permanent and only timed for around 30 days or less. AeriaGames has recently announced that they would bring back some of the permanent guns, but that won't fix the damage it has done in the past 3 years. We'll see what direction the game goes towards now.  Other Notes: -Competitive scene is trash. Only a few good players are left, and the rewards are not very tempting. Hence my profile -Servers are horrible. I get ~10 ping in CSGO, while mine is 100+ in NA servers and 150+ in EU servers. -Consistent shots that do not get 'registered,' meaning if two guys shoot at the same time, only one of theirs will register(depends on their ping. -Game tempts you to buy Mystery Boxes for AP, its mostly a scam as you'll have ~1% chance to get something good. -Grenades are BS. -Huge difference between guns bought with real money and guns bought from ingame money with a few exceptions in the more difficult guns( SA58 PARA &amp; AK12) The ONLY reason I gave this game a 4.5/10 is because I still value the memories I've had on this game since I started ~6-7 years ago. I would've gave this game a 9/10 back then as it was growing consistently under IJJI. Many people are quitting everyday, or simply lose interest because of how there are little to none permanent guns. I planned on spending my 10$ of steam wallet for AeriaPoints, but instead I decided to buy CSGO on sale. It was one of the best choice I've ever made .  I used to play competitively in AVA in my prime, CGO and ESL. My team and I were quite good, winning a few tournies and sometimes came in as runner-ups. It's a shame that it now favors towards the EU players( aka Crackheadz and Reves) as the tournaments(though they're really pitiful tournies) are held in EU servers instead.",0
Almost not even worth the black rose. Uninstalled promptly after getting the item.,0
"Horrible game. Only installed for the Black Rose, a knife for the Spy class in Team Fortress 2. Glad that this is F2P.",0
"just get for tf2 promo,if it works for you,when it 'updates' it shoves pay to win things in front of you and takes forever.",0
"Biggest peice of ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ ever made, comes with its very own keylogger. Whoever had the idea of that can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves :P unless you want to be watched 24/7 don't make the same mistake I made (and all I wanted was the TF2 knife T-T).",0
"I did not really enjoy this game because of the graphics and the fact that it was somewhat boring, not to mention that it is justa free version of CSGO.",0
Can't even get in to the game without getting an error and crashing. What a great ♥♥♥♥ing game to uninstall...,0
"Textbook pay-to-win garbage. People who put extra money into the game to buy premium weapons win more. Just spend your money on a balanced, fair game instead of paying out the nose to win at this piece of garbage.",0
"It's not counterstrike 0/10  terrible game   got a fancy lookin knife for my spy in TF2 though, so I'll give it a 1/10",0
Crappy and free so only worth instlling for the black rose.,0
black rose innit terrible game tho,0
Run &amp; Gun P2Win game... Don't waste your time,0
"This is the worst install i have ever encoutered in my life. I have been fiddling around for 3 hours straight now, i am gonna re-install the game for the 3rd time and see if i can follow a third community work around to fix this wreck of a game.  + i would have never heard of that piece of ♥♥♥♥ if it wasnt for the fact that i wanted the TF2 Black Rose.   ♥♥♥♥ this game, ♥♥♥♥ Aeria games, ♥♥♥♥ their devs, ♥♥♥♥ their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ their marketing tactics (20$ DLC gtfo)  ♥♥♥♥ this trash they dare to call a game",0

"Love yourself, man. Unless you want to get that tf2 knife, don't even bother looking at this game. It's chances of even working on your computer in the FIRST place are minimal at best. Looking for a fix for it, all i saw was to 'install the official version' from their website. But since I wanted tf2 items, i had to screw around with far too many settings in order for it to work. three reinstalls, two steam validity checks, and one new user account later, i managed to get it to start up, but after all of 5 minutes, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 'xigncode' anti-cheat software tells me i'm running a 'suspicious program' and disconnects me. Asking for more info causes it to have a damn fit and die, and attempting to view its log file is harder translating the rosetta stone to ♥♥♥♥ing klingon. after multiple short attempts to play, i managed to get on a server just seconds before the game ended, so i could get my knife and leave. i'm writing this review before purging my hard drive with holy water. the game is utter ♥♥♥♥ even if it works at all. and if you don't believe me, look at it's splash screen:  http://i.imgur.com/kTwLLN6.png ",0
I do not recommend this game. It will not work. Do not download this game not even for TF2's Black Rose,0
How to play:  1. Instal game.  2. Create profile.  3. Play game on a public server.  4.Get the sexy TF2 weapon 'Black Rose.'  5. Uninstal game.  Best free TF2 weapon simulator. Stupid pay-to-win game.  ,0
I'd rather be wasting money on bad rats than playing this game for free.,0
a very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and generic Millitary FPS...AS IF WE DONT HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE! the only reason i wasted 4 hours of my life on this piece of garbage is because of the TF2 promotional item xD dont play this after you got the achievement! this game will heavily disappoint you,0
You can't even start up the game!! -_-,0
Came for the TF2 The Black Rose knife.  Useing the uninstall button b-cuz it's a Pay To Play :/,0
Step 1: Get A.V.A. (Alliance of Valliant Arms) Step 2: Play Flappy Bird or some stupid app game while downloading. Step 3: Open A.V.A.

In it for black rose,0
"I just played this game to get a Team Fortress 2 promotional item, but I did play the game for at least an hour to get an idea of how well the game was made; it was pretty bad. I've been told that it has been updated, but I doubt it has really improved by a lot. The game has relatively good graphics but displeasing gameplay. Killing people is extremely easy which makes killing unimpressive and unsatisfying. Players in this game tend to be very horrible at first-person shooters, making winning for your team almost effortless. The upgrades on your weapons make your player even more over-powered, as you receive extremely beneficial upgrades on your weapons whereas other players still have default un-upgraded weapons. This makes playing even more easier. The gamemodes almost mimic Counter-Strike and I would daresay this game is merely just a low-funded copy of Counter-Strike. I would not recommend this game unless you're seriously bored and craving to dominate other players... the fun in this game can only last so long.",0
"This game is bad. For one, the tutorial is completely broken, as I was never able to complete the first objective. Another thing that is broken is the sound. I could rarely hear sound from bullets and such, because there was none. Third, it dosen't allow Fullscreen mode, which I will always put up in FPS games. Although I think we all know the reason we all got this game: for the Black Rose spy knife in TF2.",0
After 45 minutes of suicidal thoughts I got the knife.       10/10 would wish for the sweet relief of death again,0

"Started playing this game when IJJI was still around. Now Aeria Games literally threw the game in the trash and are trying to make profit off of stupid ♥♥♥ consumers. The game has a very toxic community and I was very sad to see some of my favorite players and other friends quit the game because of the community. If you want to play a good fps game go buy Counter Strike : Global Offensive, or any other Counter Strike because this game is god awful. Will come back to this game every once in a while to ♥♥♥♥ around with old friends but I will never play competitive again. Also if you still play the game and think it's good congrats cause you're probably either a cheater or a lagger.

"Well it was good for some years,  but since Aeria Games took over its just bad:  - Cons They have removed the perman-weps, They put some kind of Pay-to-win into the game, It has now since there are no perma-weps anymore, way more hacker and this is a game what has already so much hackers...., There is not much Content added in the past 4 Years, so there will not come much more (Besides of more skins for weapons that are already in the game (and this skins make the guns even more pay to win)), Locks one account to your Steam Account, Easy to trick the system (Easy access for Cheaters and Hackers); - You can use macros to remove your recoil - You can use massiv glitches all around in every gamemode - You can trick the co-op mission with massiv glitches - You can use the anti-cheat programm to cheat (just give it some wrong informations)#+ - And so on.... Community is Toxic as hell, like in all Aeria games,  + Pros Has a fancy flip knife for TF2 Runs on Unreal3 Nice Options menu with many options to chose of, which makes it easy to run even on 10 years old systems (Bcs of UE3) Nice Ragdolls   I would give it a 27/100 if you can look over hackers and a pay to win model its a great game.

Worst. FPS. Ever.  Hit registration is ♥♥♥♥. People demand you play as one class. If you don't you get kicked. You can be kicked from any server. They use the term 'public' loosely.  Set-up and Interface are dumb. Press the same button twice and you get 2 different weapons.  I wanna re-install it just so I can have the satisfaction of uninstalling it again.

The main menu is strange and the music doesn't fit at all.  What can I say? Maybe if they remake it and put more effort into it....it would be a good game,or atleast mediocre..

"Don't listen to most of these reviews, as almost all the negative ones are from people that download it just to get the Black Rose knife in TF2 and don't take the time to even try to game.

I figured since all the reviews are down voting the game and they aren't even giving the game as shot I thought Id pich in.  A.V.A was once an amazing free to play shooter, it had everything you wanted / needed in shooter and then of course Aeria Games does what they do best, and ruin titles by making them pay to win. First they started off by removing PERM weps and thats when it all went down hill.. back when IJJI had this game, it was amazing.  Aeria Games hurt this game badly, and honestly I don't see it recovering. Although A.V.A now has a decent publisher (En Masse) I just don't see the damage from Aeria Games being fixed. The likely hood of players giving this a game a shot again is very low.  The game is old, dying, and full of hackers. En Masse does a pretty good job of getting rid of all the hackers but they have yet to replace the anti cheat (XIGN CODE 3) so after banning someone, they simply make a new account. Also, En Masse banning hackers is hurting the game as well, as majority of A.V.A's player base is hackers, the player base has now suffered. I truly believe this is the reason Aeria never banned, as if they banned they would lose players and that would mean losing money. Overall the gameplay is fun as hell and very good for a FREE title. As a free player you CAN compete with someone who pays, but the game has too man problems and honestly don't see it ever changing now.  Give the game a shot, it's free. En Masse has done wonderful things already, but the damage has been done, sadly. If anything, download to get the BLACK ROSE!",0

"This game used to be one of my favourite fps games out there. I even tried competative in it. Aeria games made the game just go downhill. Literally. With new updates, one after another, they managed to ♥♥♥♥ up such a simple thing like perm weapons, This ain't something you wanna play if you want to play a f2p game, this is Pay2Win.",0
"  If i am being honest, this game is the worst FPS 2016, hackers no GM/GS IGN, no updates and rigged community. you do good while playing and get called hacker instantly. This game is fun only when you play with friends and troll diehard. Since enmasse took over, i had high expectations but they seem not to care like : 'Huh, new game, cool'.

I didn't bother to read the reviews, terrible idea. The gameplay is terrible, snipers dominate every game. The amount of hackers is phenominal! Good luck joining a public game! It took me almost an hour to find out how to play. In short the knife is not, I repeat, NOT worth the stain this will leave on your game library.",0

"I played it for about 3 days, and I actually had some fun with it as it's pretty much a carbon copy of Combat Arms with better graphics and I was a sucker for that game when I was a teenager.  Then on the fourth day the game failed to launch and never launched again, it didn't matter if I uninstalled it and deleted the cache located in Appdata.  It. Just. Won't. Work. Anymore.  Thus, I can't give it anything but a negative review even if I wanted to give it a positive. There's also the fact that it installs a keylogger on your computer, so be careful.",0
I think the tutorial of this game caused permanent damage to my hearing.,0

I like it but i wasted money on this because the cd key say's its invalid when i copy to clipboard,0
"So, I originally downloaded this game to get the Black Rose, then uninstalled after 1 game after seeing how terrible this game is. The menus are so confusing and cluttered, it's really hard to find anything. Only thing I could do was click 'Quick Join'. I jumped into a game of Team Deathmatch on some Christmas map, which was one the worst maps I've ever played in an FPS, however I'm not sure if it was official or modded, if it was official, this game's maps suck hard. First thing I noticed was that I couldn't change my settings in-game, which meant I was stuck on an extremely high sensitivity all game. Second thing I noticed is that this game is UGLY. Seriously ugly. The ADS is one the worst things I've ever seen, it literally takes up the whole screen and is very hard to use and looks bad. The paid guns are extremely overpowered and from what I've heard that real money shop is a rip off. After a game that lasted far too long, I checked if I had the Black Rose and uninstalled.  This is the worst F2P shooter I've ever played, the gameplay is just boring, unbalanced and just not fun at all, the game has bad graphics and some of the worst menus I've ever seen outside of JRPGs.  0/10, don't play it unless you want the Black Rose.",0
This game is one of the worst games that there can ever be. It sucks to the point where there is a hacker in every room. Not to mention the company running the game are money ♥♥♥♥♥s. Do yourself a favor and don't even try this horrible game.,0

To top it off it sexualizes certain figures in attempt to coax you to play, or something... I only got it to get the Black Rose, and tbh, it was ALMOST not worth a single round in this game. The server browser is very painful to use, and doesn't make much sense, not to mention it's all-around not fun due to the 'One-shot sniper rifle' that seems to exist in all games attempting to be CS:GO. So, no, I don't recommend this.",0

I can't even go into the game.,0
"Pros: -Black rose  Cons: -The black rose is considered an 'Achievement item', and so, it is not tradeable. -The signup page which you have to go to uses HTTP rather than HTTPS, which means that the password and email which you enter into it are not encrypted, and so, anyone else using the same wireless network as you can read both your password and email as they are being sent. Use a fake email (You don't need to verify your email) and a simple password which you will never use for any service to counter this, as all you need to type in on the login screen is the username and password you chose. -You have to give the game administrator privileges every time you start it. This means that the game has full access to your computer: It can install new programs, delete system files, or install malware or rootkits, etc. Even if the developers don't program such things, any vulnerability in this buggy game would allow a hacker unlimited access to your computer. -The game UI is horribly designed. It seems like the developers were testing how many buttons they can cram onto a single screen as possible without having tooltips on any of them. -You are not allowed to create a character with more than 10 letters or numbers in the name, and almost every combination is already taken, so you will need to keyboard mash until you get a combination which has not been used. -Pay to win",0

"Farewell, AVA... another great game that got ruined by the publisher (in this case, Aeria Games).  AVA (this version of it... for those who are unaware a lot of F2P games have separate versions for different service areas, e.x. North America, Europe, Korea, etc, AVA is no different) was originally published by the now-defunct ijji. ijji sold the publishing rights of AVA to Aeria Games. Unfortunately, Aeria Games goes against many of the values I saw ijji had. ijji was decent at being involved with the community, listening to their feedback, and not trying to just grab everybody's cash. Aeria Games is exactly the opposite, they have ZERO community involvement, and are always scheming for a way to get their hands on your money. Before, you used to be able to buy weapons permanently. Now many weapons are 'rented.' Instead of paying $15 for a permanent gun, you now pay $15 for 30 days use of that gun. Not to mention that AVA used to not be so concerned about usage duration, they had (keyword: had) a system where equipment would degrade as you used it rather than just expiring after a set amount of time.",0

I get back on to try it again and idiots keep team killing me right before the match even begins. Luckily I just dealt with it till I got the black rose for TF2.

"Started playing this game back when IJJI ran it. Was a great game, much like CS, but better graphics. played over 1000 hours, got high ranks, collecting weapons.

"I played this game for the Black rose in TF2 but was kicked out of 20 servers before joining them and quick match doesn't work so I was forced to waste more time on this game than I should've. Also, when I shot several weapons, they didn't make noise. 10/10 would play this Early Access game never again.  Update: Valve needs to remove this game A.S.A.P. as it installs nGameGuard, a third-party anti-cheat software that is a keylogger and can be used against you. In case if you don't know, a keylogger records every single key stroke you make, and a hacker can decipher that and steal your account and password on any website ever!

"I used to think this was a pretty good game, but then I learned that it uses Nprotect game guard, a rootkit that keylogs you, worsens your cpu, and when the game is uninstalled, it remains on your computer.

How to 'Play' Aliance of Valiant Arms:  1: Install game. 2: Play a round. Maybe a few (NOT RECOMENDED). 3: Get the Black Rose. 4: Uninstall. 5: Use your antivirus to get rid of the malware this 'Game' puts on your computer.  10/10 Would play Football/Soccer with Combat knives again.,0

Sat down installed for 3 hours then logged in.. Attempted* to log in. I was never able to log in and wasted my time, even people who just play for the Black Rose, Don't. It will waste your time and my time because I wrote this stupid ♥♥♥ review.  Thank you pals and see you in... idk. Bye.",0
"My god..this game. This game is by far the worst game ever I have ever played in my entire life and what will be the rest of it. I gave a positive review to Bad Rats, a game about terrorist rats that massacre and desecrate cats among other animals. But.. this f-ucking game, this game is the worst thing I have ever lied my eyes on. I after downloading it for an excessive amount of time as it is way too large for a game that has no content I started it up just to see I had to spend another 45 minutes in the game launcher installing patch and updates. I started a character, FPS dropped almost instantaneoulsly. I saw before my eyes,the worst game ever, terrible graphics, disgusting rendering, the worst optimization of any game, even of all games by Unity combined. It was like looking at a dead baby fetus get cut open and sucked through a sick persons mouth. It was the most disgusting and revolting thing I've ever laid my eyes on.   I changed the graphic settings and options to lowest. Now,keep in mind, I can run Arma III on high perfectly fine around 30 frames-per-second, but this game even on the main menu on several graphical settings, I can only run it 10-15 laggy fps at times, the mouse stutters and it feels like my brain is being put through a blender. I can feel the heat of the game, the complete aftermath of the warmth of the aspect of radiation surrounding the game after getting completely and brutally ♥♥♥♥♥. I started the tutorial only to see my frames per second drop to 1-3 at a time. I felt like I was getting several blows of a metal bat to the head. I felt light-headed, queazy and nauseous. I felt the pain and my stomach drop like someone had a knife at my throat, ready to end my life, if that was the real situation,at this point,I would've wanted to die.   The game was popping up with blaring alerts and irritating notifications while the volume was excessively loud even though I had it at a regular level. I saw someone running but when I tried to press WASD, the game was stuttering and trying to keep up with the horrific graphical settings. I could barely set a foot forward when the unexpected happened. One of the worst games and terribly looking and shouldn't require any processing power completely crashed after a 2-4 minutes freeze. It was just looking at someone get murdered,it was pathetic and sad. I started it back up,after waiting almost 15 minutes trying to get back to the tutorial,I finally set foot out,it was popping up with random messages that were laggily appearing and disappearing, sounds were going on and off while horribly acted and scripted voices were yelling at me like a few immature autistic kids acting out a play on a playground. It wasn't worth it. All of this was not worth the torment I was being required to suffer through to even play the tutorial for more than five minutes. I was barely just moving around aftering getting yelled pointless instructions at me when the unexpected happened again. It f-ucking crashed again.   I wasn't sure if I could start it up again,it felt like my head had just been cleared. It was as if I was experiencing the worst headache that anyone was to suffer to date and it was instantaneously cleared with no side effects. The game was closed, I didn't think I could handle anymore, I hovered my cursor over the uninstall button craving the pleasure of clicking it and ridding this blight from my PC,my life and as I hoped, my memory. I looked back,thought maybe..just maybe I could suffer through such crucial torture, one more time. I started the game up,feeling droggy. It was as if I was all of a sudden drugged,it felt like I was beaten,thrown into a vehicle,droven miles out to nowhere and thrown out in a field. I felt empty,alone, this game made me feel worse than I can even describe with words,no matter what I see in an enemy, no matter how much I hate someone even with the largest amount of malice,never in my life would I wish someone to have to suffer through the pain that is playing this disgusting excuse of a game. Looking through which seemed to be at this point blurred vision, I saw the horribly designed and just plain gross menu screen. I felt the horror of my past, every memory that seemed to be low points in my life,the horrific memories,I saw myself so desperate at this moment,even craving these moments in exchange at any moment for the release of this pain.    All I wanted now was the sweet release of death, to die rather than see another moment of this game as I clicked on a button to join a match after struggling for several moments trying to sluggily getting through a plethora of banners and ads. I managed to get through it like a maze meant for masochism and pure struggling and frustration. I had finally joined a match,I was okay,I got through it. I made it, I finally made it through the amount of torture I could finally experience. I finally met my complete and full capacity for pain and torture and I was done. I thought I was done through all of this,my frames per second were at zero but I was fine now,I was alright, I could give up now. I had such a high thrist for death, never in a million years I would've thought I could desire this so greatly but at this moment, I was.. and now, it was the only thing in my life that I truly wanted. Then the most depressing and relieving thing coinciding together happened. The game crashed.    I was rid of the pain. I was rid of the sorrow that this game was. I felt like crying but it felt like my memories had been partially exasperated, that the truly evil things in life were gone, the rest of my life would seem to be easier, to be a cake walk, because I had barely made it through this journey that is Alliance of Valiant Arms and I survived after being completely physically exhausted. I was emotionally exhausted. And finally, I was to the fullest extent, mentally exhausted. I had never had such a desire for everything to just fade away, the desire for it all to be quenched. Though,I was relieved and possibly a future patient of post-traumautic stress disorder now after experiening this long and bitter journey. I was done. I felt sorrowuful but I slowly installed the game watching it's memory and mark it left on my computer disappear..forever.So I only have one thing to say to this gam- no, this excuse for a bit of space in this world, this direct spawn of Satan. The most miserable thing that has ever crossed the plane of life and this Earth. 'F-uck you!'  ",0

"Oh boy. AVA.  The disgusting child of mixing CS's objectives and team-based strategy with free-to-play games' gimmicks, such as buying new guns, big-breasted female NPCs, and repairing gun damage.  As everyone in the negative (and probably funny) reviews say, I can confirm that, if you see this game in someone's library, it's only because they played a single match in the game's multiplayer in order to obtain a special weapon for TF2 (which is a FAR better game, by the way).  At best, this game is slightly below average. At worst, it's a disgusting mash-up of CS gameplay with F2P money-begging.",0
Its sad that the only reason people buy your game so that they can get a free item for a game that is 10X better.,0
would rather eat a dogs ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than play this,0

"Dont get it it is the worst free fps out there, plus its a cs copy gone bad",0
"Well if you got friends to play whith it can be really fun. But a huge problem is the Pay to win, in this game... theres guns for teal money that just are way to op. like corvus a high damage smg whith a really big magasine no recoil and gets 1+ damage for everykill. in the end you can just run around and kill everyone by shooting 3 bullets in there feets. theres almost no permanent guns. only way to get the better guns perm is from spending real money on lootweels/lootforge and so on. the event's are broken. it says play for that long and get ingame money. but you dont 50% of the time. theres unlimited bugs and glitches. and full of hackers 1 day after a game uppdate... and most of the times if you send a ticket about somthing to aeria you will just get a auto messege back... it's a really good game in many ways, but it's inpossible to play if your a new player and runs in to someone that pays real money. and then we got the match system that just runs a team of low levels against high ranks and they will just die and die. and if it's not that theres a biger problem whith match... NO PING LIMIT! i dont know howmany times me and my friends meets a team were everyone got 300+ping. and it's inpossible to kill them you can shoot 1000bullets in there head but the bullets whont registrer. so yeah. try the game if you really whant to. but you whont have a fun time playing whithout friends. And if you like the game and feel the same way. just switch game for awhile. maby they will change publisher. i think they will. the player base is falling really fast.",0
The screenshots are other and the game too :) but this is f***king game!,0
"This game was wonderful back in the day when ijji owned it.

This game oddly reminds me of CS:GO... Dunno why...,0
It's not a horrible game. It's just not very good or polished. It feels weird and barely anyone plays. Tries to be like Counter Strike but the execution is flawed.,0

Everyone plays it for the black rose.,0
"I started this game years ago, when it was on Ijji, then also on Aeria and even on Steam. I played from time to time and never got the chance to go further than 5 ranks, because of how ♥♥♥♥ I was. I didn't encounter that much hackers, only a few, and I never noticed any 'Pay2Win' status because, and I quote myself, of 'how ♥♥♥♥ I was'.  Still a nice-stable-rather-smooth-not-too-heavy-CS-wannabe-FPS.   Problem began when 5 minutes ago, bored of my boredom, I decided to reinstall it to see if I'm still ♥♥♥♥. The game is in my library, but Steam decided that the game's product code was activated from another 'geographic area', thus I cannot download it neither launch it. And I can't even uninstall it because, hey, I 'actually' have it. I cri evertim   A.V.A/10 - Would Try To Uninstall Again ",0

This one time I had diareah, I decided to squat over the toilet instead of sit. I ended up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all over the walls. Cleaning that up was more fun than playing this game.",0
"in my opinion i dont like but some people might, its not one of the best free to play out there.",0
It stole 5 bucks from me ! i never got my AP.,0
This game is horrible and riddled with problems. The only reason I would ever recomend any one this game is for the tf2 item.,0
"Its just a bad game, trying to be big like CoD or something, but this is pretty much a worse version of CoD, its OP, unfair and confusing. Its really one of the only games I would ever right a review about it being bad, but this is a horrible game. I mean, CoD is bad enough, but this is even worse. You need to download it twice on a platform and on steam, then you see it doesnt work and you have to delete ALL local content and download it twice AGAIN. Its just a horrible game, do not download it or buy it, trust me, even thought its free its not worth it. Even if youre an achievement hunter like me, you will not spend ANY time trying to get achievements from this game unless it is first one down for a knife (The Black Rose) in TF2. That is litterally the ONLY reason half of AVA players have it. This is a horrible game DONT get this atrocious, abominable evil monster.",0
"After getting into the game i waited a good 15 mins for the game to start up, once in i began the tutorial. At one point the game attempted to teach me about scouting by pressing F5, you would pull out a pair of binoculars and click to spot. The game told me to scout the enemies in front of me...no enemies were there or spawned. After this i uninstalled the game due to the fact if they can't even get a tutorial right what are the ♥♥♥♥ing chance of the rest of this thing being any good. And i would rather get ebola than listen to the music in this game.  Well just got into the game and.....It's the worst pile of ♥♥♥♥ i have ever played. Not once in my life have i ever been annoyed by a video game. Every thing about this is ♥♥♥♥.

I woulden't recommend this game unless your looking for a new TF2 spy knife (black rose)  step 1) install the game and spend 15 mins of your life to install it  step 2) wait another 30 min to install all game files  step 3) get the first achivement  step 4) quit the game delete it  step 5) go to TF2 and enjoy your blck rose  step 6) tell evey one the game is bad and never play it unless you want the black rose ,0
"Play this game just for the TF2 item then uninstall !  Otherwise it's like a cheap crappy version of Counterstrike. Even if you don't have CS don't waste your time on this game, only played the first few levels and its the worst FPS I've seen.",0

Ever wanted to know what cancer feels like?!?! Well today is your lucky day!,0
"This would be a very decent free-to-play online FPS, unfortunately it's plagued by several things. First off, it's very pay-to-win—players with deep pockets buy the biggest and best guns to dominate the match(a handgun that can kill with one shot to the leg? I think not.). And even most of the items you CAN buy only last for a short amount of time, mostly not even for a whole day. And the 'free' Welcome Package? Having to PURCHASE in-game currency to receive a set of items isn't free, it's a purchase bonus. Call it what it is, don't sugarcoat it.  Then, there's the bugs. Half the time I launch the game, it fails(not anything wrong on my end, I checked), and when I was able to play, several of my simple achievements(such as 'Play as the Rifle Man for the first time') took several unnecessary playthroughs to unlock. Oh, then there's the plagiarized Resident Evil art used in the promo pictures when you launch the game. Shameful.  Honestly, this could've been a great, free alternative to CS:GO. But when all is said and done, it's only worth playing for the initial 15+ minutes to unlock the Black Rose knife for a much better free-to-play online FPS—Team Fortress 2.  2.5/10",0
you get what you pay for...,0
"There's a few things to say about this game: 1. The only people who play this game are in it for the TF2 knife or literally have no money to buy CS:GO 2. This game freezes more than Fallout New Vegas on a Mac... in the Arctic 3. If I wanted pop ups, I'd turn off my Ad Blocker and open Redtube in multiple tabs 4. Unless you play Spy a lot, it's almost not even worth it",0

Possibly the blandest game I've had the displeasure of playing recently. The only plus is that I got a cool knife for my Spy loadout in TF2.,0
Played it just to get the knife and I must say I'm glad I didn't spend a dime. Thank you critics!!!,0
"This game is complete ♥♥♥♥, do not play it.",0
To get a TF2 knife I had to play this. I downloaded it and joined a server...  10/10 would join a sever and shout 'WHAT IS THIS ♥♥♥♥?',0
"Got perm banned for farming too much AP after being a loyal legit player for 5+ years, so gg, will never forget this game even though it didn't end up well.",0
sometimes it exits ur game when ur playing ,0
Its a pay to win game.,0

"This game is not only pay to win, but also pay to play once you are a high level. I have become unable to fix the durability of my default weapons and literally cannot play anymore. At least it gives you one of the coolest weapons in TF2.",0
"Now the thing to note with this review is that I am not complaining about the game. The game is fine, excellent, a real contender to the crap of Battlefield Play4free, but the only thing holding it back is the current licensee of the game, Aeria Games. Once upon a time, there was a company called Redduck, and they created a game called A.V.A. Now they licensed it as a free to play game under Ijji (for the US) and it revolutionized free to play games since it had PERMANENT WEAPONS. not once that timed out after some number of days, PERMANENT WEAPONS. Now, some games had this too, but AVA was different, you could get this permanent weapons for in game money, without ever having to pay a cent, (I was one of these users). In fact, while some would consider the game flopping with multitudes of free users, the game thrived, until Aeria Games noticed the competition and profits this game was making and decided to gain control of this mini-monopoly. While this went smooth at first, things started getting rough when Aeria started offering more and more items using its real money based currency-AP. At first, it was just skins, to make the existing guns look cooler, and no one had any complaints. But then, the game became unbalanced as the free users found themselves being outgunned by better weapons that one had to pay for. A new form of balance was needed, the switch to time weapons. However, while this might have balanced the game instead it ruined a once perfect game, for the OP (overpowered) AP gun were not timed (some were, but most weren't, at first), no, the igc (in-game-currency, the currency you get for playing the game) guns were timed, and soon, it was discovered they were nerfed (made weaker). One by one, the full time AVA players left, never to return again, today the game is in danger of being shut down. A dying FTP game, saving your money and play SF2 (Soldier Front 2). Its still living with events every week, and a growing fanbase, don't waste your time with AVA, under Aeria passes it on, fixes its issues, or worse, shuts the game down.  edit: this game has be ruined too much, there is no point in trying to start to play this game, only play if you are an older player who is returning, not a new player",0
Good game if you're a masochist.,0
I only played it for the fish.,0
I Got my knife. Now i use it to kill this game.,0
"DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME  what to say for this game . full of bugs , cheaters all around and you cant play , noone give a ♥♥♥♥ for what is going on there, only they ask for money to buy stuff , but all useless if you can not play the game.",0
"The game's launcher didn't even bloody start up for me, so Steam kept thinking AVA was runnign even tho it wasn't. gud ♥♥♥♥♥ game 0/10",0
"In order to review this game you must put in 12,000 hours to get 1 in game currency and then do this 40,000 more times or just invest your life savings in order to put one word in the review. This game is so pay to win that it makes League of Legends look balanced. I suggest a game such as Loadout or TF2 or anyother game.",0
Gave this a shot to get that TF2 knife not gonna lie. What I got to play is a generic really bad counter strike knockoff with tons of cashgrab options. Oh and since most people try this to get the TF2 knife new launcher broke steam overlay so you can't even get that now apparently. Good work.,0
black rose knife is good,0
I Just Installed this game for the free knife  oh wait i dont play spy,0
black rose knife is good,0
I Just Installed this game for the free knife  oh wait i dont play spy,0
Will not launch,0
Its a really bad game and its way harder then it should be to get the knife re-skin in tf2 wich is really the only reason to play this game,0
not worth 1 hour,0
"Terrible. The game is extremely laggy, even for a pretty good PC. When I started the tutorial, The game crashed. It took around 30 minutes for the game to even start up, much less install. The character creation option was poor, sporting only presets for what your face looks like. No actual character creation/personalization like things happened exept naming my character. Get your head out of your butt A.V.A. and make your game playable.",0
lol this gam is such a rip of :D lol is lags out and and it sucks:D and i hope the game owners see this cuz i dont want ppl to play it cu this game is bull shet :D,0
Sucks how you need a third-party signup to play. It takes a while to setup everything before actually playing the game. I wouldn't recommend.,0
"Game went to ♥♥♥♥ when Aeira Games got hands on it when ijji sold their game to them. It sad that A.V.A, used to be in a league of its own when it first came out. A.V.A is now turned into any Aeria Games P2W model, such as Wolfteam, and ruin theirs games for the f2p community.",0
Downloaded and played this game on my last computer to get the black rose. The files were infected.  I got a new computer.  At least I still got my knife &lt;3,0
It Didnt run... I couldnt get my black rose :(,0
Does not even load and crashes,0
"This game is a Pay to Win Simulater, I had a friend who paid $100 to this game just to win because he is bad at this game. Now, he has the best weapons because he paid $100. He wasted his money and you shouldn't waste your money either because this game is pay2win and if you like to pay 2 win, than don't play it anyways because this game is overall bad and nobody should ever go and try or feel or anything else to this game because it deserves nothing. This game should die because it is so heavily pay2win, they have red tickets which require you to spend so much AP which is the in-game currency which you gamble for red tickets to get just some cool overpowered weapons in the shop. You can also buy exculsive weapons with only AP and theres sometimes a special shop called the mega capsule shop where you can spend $20 for a virtual weapon and own everybody with your OP gun. So in all, this game is terriably pay2win and nobody should take there time out of there day to play this game.",0
Just did it for the Black Rose knife :3,0
"I love FPS, especially free ones, but with this game it just feel so generic, simple, and very close quarters. Its fun for a little while but thats abot it for me",0

Fun for a while when you know you can get guns whenever you want then you realize you only get 300 a game and you are trying to get a 75k weapon.,0
"Only played it to get the black rose (a promo knife in tf2)  But i tell you my expirience was terrible. Firstly the tutorial was bad and not informative, when i finally did get onto a game the graphics were terrible for a game made in 2011. The sniper rifle was too overpowered and I found the gameplay very boring.  DO NOT GET THIS GAME IT IS A WASTE OF TIME TO DOWNLOAD   2/10",0
waste of time,0
"I got my knife... after 5 crashes of starting up and after 3 games instead of 1, I finally got my knife... I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone unless you want the knife... holy crap this game sucks                                -1,000,000/10",0

Pay to Win Hackers everywhere nothing happens to hackers Timed weapons Did I say Pay to Win? Yeah...... Its Pay to Win COD is better than this. Earlier statement about COD was truly a struggle. Downloads spyware Viruses Crashes constantly Doesn't start up 10/10 would laugh and ignore again.,0

Aeria Games ruined this once great game.  Don't bother with this shell...,0
Thanks for nothing but a knive skin.,0
"I only ever got this game for the black rose in tf2. i didn't give a crap about the game. i and since it's a free to play game, and most of the frees are crap, with exceptions, i don't have much to say about it.",0

I NEED AN ACOUNT?!? i dont have time to make an account the only reason i did this was to get a tf2 wepon not worth the time or effort,0
"It looked promising, but it was awful.",0
"♥♥♥♥ game, only for black rose",0

"Note that these were what I was actually thinking when I was actually going through the pain of trying to get the Black Rose)   OH FOR GOD'S SAKE COULD YOU STOP CRASHING   Oh hey, it stopped crashing. Now to get the Black Rose and dump it faster than Atari dumped those ET cartridges   I should have gotten the achievement by now, why did nothing happen?   The dancing guy when looking for players is kinda funny, I admit it   It turns out it's a common issue AND I NEED TO REINSTALL THE GAME ENTIRELY   I FINALLY GOT THE ACHIEVEMENT I CAN UNINSTALL THIS HEAP OF GARBAGE NOW  I literally cried tears of joy when I got the achievement. 0/10 Would experience again though.",0
"Don't play this game, unless you want the tf2 knife, cuz that's the only reason people buy this",0
"I have an intense fear of vomiting and even vomiting constantly with bodily fluids pouring out of me as I scream and cry in agony is much more enjoyable than this form of torture that dares to call itself a video game. Changing resolution doesn't work, every window goes OFF SCREEN and I can't hit the confirm button, NONE of the achievements work (I literally just downloaded this game to get the Black Rose for TF2), and the Last Man Standing mode is slightly enjoyable if you just sit back and watch some idiot fail at shooting as someone else runs around in circles, punching the guy with the rifle to death as he comes out victorious until he suffocates in the big green cloud of despair.",0
Terrible counter strike clone,0
"Its like a mix of Call of Duty and CS:GO, but just plain bad. Its not terrible...but it won't be played by me again.",0
Boobs don't make crappy CS/CoD clones better.,0
SO there i was. Waiting to install a.v.a It installed. I opened it. it crashed. Finally it worked. Got on a server. I got a message from my friend. this is what it said. ' so... did you get the knife yet'. I sat there crying blood wishing to get it. every time my team would lose. I finally won a round. But here is the bad part. I. did. not. get. the. knife. DUN DUN DUN. So i waited. So enough i played on a 0 player server. get knife instantly. GOT ON TF2 AND KILLED THE SQEAKERS.   True story-IrelandWarrior,0

"Pretty lack lester, if you play TF2 It's worth getting for the Black Rose knife and then I'd reccomend uninstalling, but that's just me I played ike maybe 3 games, but that's only due to my frustration from it closing itself by somehow detecting itself as a malicious program with it's anti-virus/anti-cheat thing. In the 3 games I did play I had no idea what was going on.",0

"How to win this game: 1) Go to the store page 2) Scroll down to the 'report flag' on the left hand side of the screen 3) Click the 'broken' radio button. 4) Uninstall the game 5) Reinstall the game 6) Ask yourself, 'Is this really worth it for the knife? What is my life?' Repeat steps 4 through 6, ad nauseum or until the game functions long enough for you to obtain the knife, whichever won't kill you.  BONUS: If you're looking for the answer to Step 6, Go play The Talos Principle and then ask yourself why you ever even attempted this game.",0

I spent some amount of time playing this game. But then... I realized that I could just buy Counter-Strike.,0
"I have played this game a long time before it turned in to a pay to win , since aeria games took the control , I uninstalled , I have actually checked it from time to time to see if it got any better , soon to find out it got worse.

this is stinky stinky poopy... but the black rose isn't,0
"This game is a heaping pile of ♥♥♥♥...  It was slightly enjoyable in 2012 when it actually worked, however coming back to see what improvements have been made 4 years later is dissapointing to say the least as it is more broken than ever.  First, good luck with the launcher, the thing is completely useless. Installed the game from Steam, couldn't get it to run. Verified files, still no go. Ran launcher to verify files, launcher hangs forever. Unistalled game. Reinstalled game. Finally it works!  Oh yeah but now, no Steam overlay and no Steam achievements working. Tried running as admin, enabling / disabling antivirus (which no other game requires me to do and still everything works), putting a fork in my scsi drive, all to no avail...  Nothing I do can make this game run well like it did in 2012!  I've played games (not just one) from the 90's that still run better than this trash.  Support is utterly useless.  And we haven't even begun on the massive pay 2 win structure employed. Just the abysmal programming that is this complete disaster of a piece of ♥♥♥♥. I hope this complete pile of ♥♥♥♥ dies in a dumpster where it was conceived.",0

I got this game when I was 12 because it looked like Call of Duty.  Call of Duty is way better than this $hit.,0
Anyone who plays this game for anything other than the knife has no soul and/or life. 10/10 would uninstall again.,0
"The only negative thing I could find (apart from the difficulty of obtaining the Black Rose and the virus, as people claim) was the thought given to naming the classes.  Rifle Man, Sniper, and Point Man. I understand not wanting to have any similarity to Team Fortress 2, for example, but you got to think your names through. Another alternative would be to give the classes real names.  Lastly, I personally think players are more interested in video games that have a backstory to them. Take Team Fortress 2. The comics explain a great deal of things that happen in-game.  In conclusion, I would give this game 4 out of 10 stars.",0

Kinda pay to win. Money system is broken. Hackers are abundant. Overall 4 out of 10.,0
A ton of cheaters.  ^ Thats it.,0
Please don't play this! and before you say 'oh you don't like it because it's not tf2' NO! The game is just not fun. I recomend somthing diffrent for your fps fix. Go play dirty bomb.,0
This game is pretty gay.,0
What everyone does with this game: 1.Install it 2.Create a character 3.Play a game 4.Get Black Rose 5.GG WP,0
This game lacks the newbies vs newbies server and instantly matches you with experienced player Cons; It's just a poor CoD ripoff with awfull graphics (even CS 1.6 looks better) It rip offs CSGO by weapon skins which can be used for x days. Pros; The delete button works That TF2 item for Spy looks really good.,0
I just wanted to get the Black Rose and maybe find a new FPS I could enjoy. I couldn't even do that. Game crashes after seconds of launching it.,0

"I don't even know if it was good, but it probably wasn't. It's probably your average f2p game where you purchase good guns so people stop being alive when you shoot them, but I don't even know. I couldn't even create an account cuz' of the impossible capichas",0
It did not give me the black rose!!!,0
the game wouldnt run on my computer... and the black rose just doesnt seem worth it,0
suck,0

'PLAY THE BEST MMO, browser and mobile games free' Obviously this ♥♥♥♥ING ad does not work because i got so many AD BLOCKS on my PC. And let me tell you guys at AVA, there is a REALLY good reason i use that, and because of it, i cannot play this stupid game that was developed by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Good job. All i wanted was that stupid TF2 knife, but nooo, not even that could i get from this ♥♥♥♥. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GUYS.",0
Waits an hour while game downloads Wants to play 1 and only one game for the item in TF2 Opens Not responding Opens again Responding Wait 20 mins Not Responding Tries one last time Doesn't respond The only thing about this game that works is the uninstall button 9/11 would totally waste time trying to play again,0
♥♥♥♥ this game. I never got pass the updates. To hell with the black rose.,0
Good Game Bad publisher... this game was VERY GOOD before aeria bought it... now theres only hackers...guns are TOO freaking hard to get and my photo is too kawaii for this game! ♥♥♥♥a you Aeria!,0
"This has been stated before but this game instals a keylogger on to your computer, which is a pain to remove. The game isn't all that different from any other fps and wouldn't even be played by anyone if not for the tf2 knife",0
How do I fix this error | ' SteamAPI_Init()failed.LastError=0 l Please help me! Freind me and I accept then tell me!,0
"Stay away from this game. The company that host this game ruined it for everyone. Almost all the players quit this game. Aeria is one of the company that is out only for your money.

Here is a Haiku for you-  The Knife is pretty sweet  First two minutes got my Black rose  Then i un installed lol,0
"I would not recommend this game to anyone ever, and I don't even know how it plays. It's so broken I can't even run it. On top of that it takes forever to download the mountains of patches for the game. If anyone wants to help with the issue, it says I can't connect to the server and then it freezes until windows closes it.",0
Can this game be fixed by now,0
Dont hate the player hate the game!,0
Played until i got banned for hacks. Otherwise this game is just another pay2win rubbish.,0
"I have to say that it is a good game for F2P but it is such a pay to win game and the mechanics are quite odd even if they try to replicate real life. The graphics are bad and even if I don't like it, I'd prefer COD over this.",0
It was a good game till the hackers came and also is pay 2 win !,0
The game doesn't work. It is missing some of the startup files ,0
This game is only good for getting the black rose for tf2. its problems CAPS LOCK IS THE SPRINT and you can't full screen,0
 I cannot recommend this game.,0
"A Free Guide to A.V.A!  Step 1. Painfully install the game, it takes a while.  Step 2. Make a random character and do the training  Step 3. Do the round  Step 4. Get the achievement and go to TF2, you now have the Black Rose!  Step 5. Uninstall   THE FIVE STEPS OF AVA!",0
Just download it for knife in TF2. Otherwise it sucks major ♥♥♥♥.,0
1. INSTALL GAME 2. GET TF2 NIFE 3. UNINSTALL GAME  4. PROFIT,0
the worst game ive ever played,0
i think this game is just a bad remake of CS:GO... and i dont like csgo. so it is fair to see were i stand gg A.V.A,0
Just as I am sure alot of people got just for the TF2 weapon. People who pay money will just own everyone who is F2P.  Just don't get it unless you want the 'Black Rose' Like me :),0
I played this game 38 hours but this game is a piece of crap 2/10,0
"It's a pay to win game. That's it.  It can be fun if you're F2P, but it's like PAYDAY 2. To have fun, you gotta pay for a lotta stuff.  F is for free items, u know u want it U is for ur black rose, N is for no playing at anytime at all, all u do is uninstaaalll  Also my anti-virus detected something weird on it and now I can't play it......",0
Getting the black rose was worth the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay,0
"i only got this game for the black rose for tf2, that is the only reason       dont play this    ",0
  cannot even play. i literally got stock 20x times and then i gave up ive tried everything.,0
this game is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible only got it for the black rose of tf2,0
Its not csgo,0
"It's okay, I just personally didn't enjoy it. Try it if you want. ",0
some of these good games have to be on mac too,0
"All my hours in this game were just installing this game. It crap by the way, but I really wanted the Black-rose. Well, better start crafting.",0
Wtf! I try to open it but it won't work!,0
Combat arms &gt; A.V.A playd this game quiet a while not on steam but afterall  if you want to keep you're weapons you got to pay for them otherwise its just a tryharding game,0
the absolute worst f2p game ever,0
"0/10 It took too long to get the Black Rose, which is this game's only purpose.",0
I even worse version of counter strike,0
Just get the TF2 knife,0
Horrible game unable to launch because of steam error. Must go into the steamapps folder to launch it and even then when it launches it is stuck ifinitly in the connectin screen. The creators said 3 YEARS AGO they would patch it and still isn't patched. I would reccomend not getting this game and wasting space on your computer.,0
BRING BACK SOLDIER FRONT 2 TO AMERICA AGAIN NOT THIS ♥♥♥♥,0

Thank you for the knife        1/10 would get black rose again,0
Fail to connect to game simulator since 2007 (came to steam in 2011.. oh well.),0
Trying to open this game is like one of those popup ads stating that a free copy of 'Minecraft Online' is just a click away. -8/8 not worth the TF2 item,0
I have just lost faith in humanity. People actually Enjoy this game. And Prefer It over TF2.,0
i have never played the game be cuse it would not let me i do not recommend this game,0
"This game is honestly garbage. Most of the community at this point is only here for the black rose, and other than that, the only people who play this are the P2W members of the community who still want their bang for their buck, and people who are looking for a fun game to play but stumbled apon this garbgage instead. Oh, and did i mention that it installs a keylogger to track EVERY. SINGLE. THING. YOU. TYPE. to supposedly 'Track cheaters'. Well I guess cheating is also known as my privacy as i dont want a third party to collect my information for a game that i personally don't even play. And the worst part about the keylogger is that it doesn't uninstall along with the game, so you have to manually dig through your files and search for the very thing that is driving you mad. So if you don't want your privacy invaded, and you can live without a TF2 knife reskin, save yourself and don't download this game.",0
Came here for the knife just like everyone else. Other than that the game was completely horrible. Still totally worth it though. :3,0
Meh it was okay don't waste your time on it though because there are plenty of other better f2p fps,0
Thanks for the Black Rose. 2/10 because Black Rose lol lmao,0
I can barely download the game now because everythings like you have to download three things just to play the game,0
Used to be a big fan of this game until the removed the possibility for permanent weapons. EVERYTHING WENT TO S**T AFTER IJJI GOT BOUGHT BY AERIA. RIP AVA,0
Step 1: Download this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game Step 2: Download more sitty ♥♥♥♥ Step 3: Download more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ Step 4: play a couple matches Step 5: Check Team Fotress 2 inventory for The Black Rose Step 6: Profit,0

i thank this game was bad bet i get the knife thow bet not going to play this thow,0
I rather go out back and pick up dog ♥♥♥♥ and eat it then even look at this ♥♥♥♥ of a game. This ♥♥♥♥ is free and i want a refund. Give me back my time played on this trash of a game infact forget it just remove this ♥♥♥ from steam. For anyone who likes unrealistic games that you need to shoot somone in the face about 6 times to even kill them then this is for you. also you probally have no friends. LOSER!,0
I used to play this game alot when the game was produced by ijji but now its complete trash. now its more like Alliance of Hackers and in sead of free2play its more like pay2win. thx for ruining ze game -420/10,0
"This game does not work. Takes forever to download. Then Had 3rd party login page to collect emails. Then does nothing when you click play. No crash, no error, no nothing. The 3rd party authentication is enough for an uninstall, but then a fully broken 10gig download is over the top. I don't think this is anything but spam collecting email addresses for 3rd party.",0
Played only for the knife. Though it would be really helpful if the thing actually turned on instead of freezing on the launcher.,0
TAKE SO ♥♥♥♥ING LONG,0
"I wish it was better it could of had potential, but sadly no, so this is just worth the tf2 knife unless you want to play for fun so enjoy.",0
Got Black Rose for TF2 Unistall this 10/10,0
"Needs a 1 player match to test your new skills? Why I got pay the ♥♥♥♥ing coins, I hate buying stuff. It's like a online free chating game for babies, but I love the guns. I love guns...",0
"Played it for 2 hours, within 2 hours I can honestly say 'I do not recommend this' with complete confidence.   The user interface is quite a mess. It does not define anything clearly, it could be more simplistic and understandable by NOT covering it in 30 SHADE OF GRAY to hide that it is a GAME. They display every single cash shop item on the game before the actual content. I had to use an ouija board to find everything my word.  The gameplay was quite hindering. Shots not registering. Dying behind a thick wall no one can shoot through. Lagging despite having a good ping. Falling dead from someone who was not even around. Switching weapons was a chore. The gun balance was also quite bad. I had a 1 shot sniper rifle and people were simply laughing it off.",0
um i played the game and um the only reason i play it cause of that knife i get in Tf2 but my friend said it not worth it. and um hes right WTF IS DIS this so u call it fps is just a abomination to a fps am sorry but plz just no just no,0
"Ah Alliance of Valiant Arms. If you took the graphics from the first half life game and the stiff controls from Minecraft and combined it with insane weapon recoil and more lag than ever, you have this game. If you want new weapons, they will cost you a fortune in microtransactions. One thing i do like, is how you soom into a reflex sight like it was a scope. But still, don't play this. I only tried it for the Black Rose, and gave it a chance.",0
This game won't let me even let to the main menu.,0
"Game isn't to bad, but it isn't that great either, the only reason i played it was for the Black Rose, and that's the only reason anybody should get this game!!!",0
"this game is dreadful. i have no idea why anyone would play this piece of ♥♥♥♥♥ for any reason other than the TF2 item. i dont even think it was worth it for the knife. what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ game. dreadful",0
"The game wont let me play it...  It says its suspicious...  27/10, Game of the year, 15 stars",0
"way too much hacks, not recommended",0
my pc can't run the game i have a intel i7 over cloked but it keeps crashing it keeps saying the drives do not support this game,0
i guess it was ok,0
"Uninstall simul8r 2005   Played only 4 black Rose  Install, play 1 game, uninstall  Pay2Win Thatsall my children",0
"still downloading the in-game stuff. if this knifes not worth it... i swear valve, why choose, of all free-to-play games, this ♥♥♥♥?",0
"some hacker managed to access my pc and broke it after i played a second game, if this pc gets broken the same way any time soon theirs gonna be an issue",0
When i was a young boy my father put me on a canoe in the middle of a lake and said '♥♥♥♥ you son' i never saw him again but then gaben saved my life with this uninstal and get promosional item simulater,0

I cant even get on with out it crashing,0
its stupid how you need to make an account at a stupid website ps. dont forget your password if u play this ,0
"I wouldn't play this game even if you payed me.  I recieved cancer, aids, and a free virus-porn site.  This game is thankfully free-to-uninistall.",0
Unable to play... keeps seeing 'suspicious programs',0
game runs terribly and you have to pay2win,0
Pros-Get a tf2 weapon  cons-everything else,0
Thanks for the black rose .,0
This game only has about 10 people playing,0
"1Install game 2Do the tutorial 3Close the game 4Open tf2 5See you got the knife 'Black Rose' 6PROFIT! Being serious,it' s bad game. ",0
sucks,0
The TF2 Knife isn't worth the pain of uninstalling this game.,0
"God awful.  -Maps made for a small group of players are too big and maps made for a large group are way too small -Many players have lag beyond 200 ping -Tries to add both running and 'walking' and fails completely (due to having to double tap W to run which is a huge inconvenience) -Infected game mode is unfair due to easy camping spots -Options are hard to change or don't fit good resolution sizes -Overall very buggy and unsmooth gameplay -Has big boobed/cleavage characters to appeal to male audiences -Scopes are literally useless for any gun other than the sniper Plus more.  On the bright side, it's free and weapons could be bought for permanent using in-game currency. There's a decent amount of game styles.  I would recommend this game on the idea that it is pretty solid of a game and it's free. But if you're looking for something that's more than people hiding in holes and shooting each other from far away, skip this.  Obligatory score: 7/10",0
very boring...only got for the black rose. 3/10,0
"Install, First Achievement, Unistall   Black rose  Its just a rip off of counter strike so well it sucks  ",0

"Takes forever to load ___________________________________ This game takes forever to load up (even waiting for a specific time.)

I only played this game to get a knife in TF2 and it was a ♥♥♥♥ing horrible expirence,0
This game is the worst experience i have ever had in gaming from the slow loading time to the cs go style that looks like they just said meh it will do half way through and then made it so that the only true reason anyone would ever spend time on this game is just to get the spy knife for tf2,0
  it says that it cant play this game on my computer..waste of my time,0
This is hacker paradise where 15$/mo can let u kill everyone that has spent 100's$ on this game and u never have to worry about being cought or them patching it cuz they simply dont give a ♥♥♥♥. ,0

Real Men play CS:GO,0
Nothing like installing a game for 2 hours then installing it for another hour. Fortunately the unistall feature was not as time-consuming.,0

Terrible. I'm writing this to NOT recommend. Play some Counterstrike if you want to play this game. That's been out for years!,0
Pay 2 Play all that matters in that game they made all weapons timeable only Ap players can get good stuff dont play it...,0
"Let's be completely honest. Most people are here for the black rose. But for those who are here for gameplay, I am new and I'm inexpierienced, but that doesn't change the fact that for my first game, I was matched with people with hundreds of hours, and nowhere near my skill group. Regardless, the game is a complete copy of CS:GO.",0
"It's a fun game, but the recoil for starters...xD",0
can I get Black Rose in tf2? So this game is a sh*t!,0
Giving Aeria Games money is like pushing a Lincoln Log in your ♥♥♥♥ hole.   Don't do it because it probably won't be very rewarding.  Pay2win..,0

"This game is complete ♥♥♥♥. I 0nly downloaded it for the black rose item in tf2, and even then I regret it. It looks like crap, with muggy textures and uninspired environments. Not to mention the bugs, jesus christ the bugs. The game will crash constantly, and will just flat out NOT WORK. I was on the tutorial, I had to break some boxes with a knife. Broke a few, saw a ladder and climbed it. The game stopped and was like 'Oh, you didn't break every single box. Go back and do that.' Broke the ONE SINGULAR box I left, and then the NPC guide for the tutorial took a step in front of me and was like 'Oh, you don't know how ladders work, so let me show you.' She then proceeded to get stuck on the ladder and I had to restart the tutorial. ♥♥♥♥ this game. EDIT: Also, this is teenage boy bait. LOOK! GUNS! MILLITARY! What? Women in the millitary? THATS RIGHT LITTLE TIMMY, and shes there simply to satisfy your desires by showing her ♥♥♥♥ off! Cause women can't millitary! SILLY! I hate this game.",0

"Boy oh boy! This game right here! It's terrible! Like everyone else, I just came here for the Black Rose in TF2.  The tutorial goes by way too fast. The menu was too confusing and I had no idea what to do. It's very complex. Which are the reasons I have almost an hour on this game. Also, I downloaded this on Steam, why do I need to make an Aeria Games account? I don't know if other Steam games to this, but this game is terrible.  Play the tutorial, have no clue what to do, find a room, finish playing, delete A.V.A., get the Black Rose. Way more difficult than it should be.",0

"This game is essentially a CS:GO ripoff, but with even more microtransactions.  Community is almost dead, game is pay-to-win (but you can do fine without paying).  And, supposedly, the game installs a keylogger called nProtect Game Guard. I still don't know how to uninstall now (unless it isn't a problem anymore?) so if anyone could help, that would be cool.   Edit: It's not nProtect Game Guard anymore. It's now something called Xigncode3. Easier to uninstall and supposedly less dangerous, but still a form of 'keylogger'. ",0

"Just give me my ♥♥♥♥ing Black Rose, please.",0
its crap,0
This game is awful! I only played so i could get the black rose knife for tf2. This game has terrible graphics and textures.. The sound cut out for half of the game. I get killed while i am falling from the air. Its just a crappy COD or battlefield game for all the people who can't get it. I know those games are expensive but play Team Fortress 2 or some other free game THAT IS ACTUALLY GOOD! The only good thing in this game is that hot girl on the cover art. Damnn. but other than that this is a ♥♥♥♥ torture of a game. Don't even waste time downloading this.,0
This game is the worst FPS gamebecause of 2 main aspects . 1 : Hackers . 2 : Pay2Play ' FOR REAL '.  I really regret playing this game .,0
"People were saying that this game has a long installation time, however, my computer (which downloaded [PROTOTYPE] in 7 hours) downloaded it in 42 seconds flat. BUT the VERIFICATION took ages to do.

"It's one of many flashy, gory too fast-paced Shotgun/Quickscope Pay to win Free to play Shooter. Its not good, not partificuly bad. But it has no iron sights and you will find yourself killed thousands of times by that guy that spended $100,- on the game. The maps are the only thing good about the game. Youre better of with a game like War inc. or Ghost Recon. Or even better a older cod Like Mw2, Mw3 or Cod 4 or 5.

I do not recomend this shi*y CSGO bootleg. The only reason i installed it was for the Black rose knife in Team Fortress 2. This piece of Sh*t CSGO bootleg was not worth the Black Rose.,0
"Used to be a decent game. Unfortuantely, nowadays it's just a shell of what it used to be. Now its full of cheaters, lags like crazy even on my fairly powerful machine, obviously a P2W and full of obnoxious microtransactions, and the game looks less impressive than it did a few years ago. I guess you could say the one thing it has going for it is the large weapon selection. If you want a F2P shooter, download Warface. That's not a P2W and looks/runs substantially better and is much more fun.",0

"GOD AWFUL GAME. Just horrible. Out of all the pitholes of horrible games on steam, I wouldn't be able to tell if this is the worst. Because I have spent over 2 hours trying to get this to work and while i was fixing things you can obviously see how little effort the programmers put into this game, With the simplest of mistakes that only someone lazy would make. Like not including the players resolution. I have tried so many different 'fixes' other people have posted online and non have fixed it. First it was a pain in the ♥♥♥ to install it, even though it's free it took over 3 hours to download since i have bad internet. Setting up an account was just tedious and I can't even launch the game without an error! As pretty much everyone here, I got this game just for the black rose in tf2, Which is a lovely knife I always wanted! But.. It's just not worth my time messing with such a horrible mistake of a game. So no i will not recommend this...",0
Does anyone honestly install this ♥♥♥♥ game for anything other than the TF2 knife?,0
"This game is so BAD! I do not understand how anyone can play this without burning their computer after because it is the worst, most ripping off and worst game i have ever played!

played this game before.the worst ♥♥♥♥ing game ever made.you need to repair your weapon for cash which you only get after level up and this ♥♥♥♥ takes a lot of space.i dont think you should even try it,0
"It's a horrible knock off of CS:GO and isn't even worth trying except to get the tf2 knife 'The Black Rose', which you should delete this game after that. Enemies have way to much health, there are pathetic classes that DONT WORK WHAT SO EVER and enemies have helmets which save them from a bullet to the head making surprise attacks worthless. Also the game will purposely get you killed by showing an enemy as friendly and then having that enemy shoot you instantly. Overall the game is not very fun and it has this whole durability thing for guns so you have to keep repairing them or that 10000$ gun you just bought will be gone, this is a fps not Minecraft, hell minecraft does it RIGHT this game is just a sad knock off of CS:GO, this game may be free but in the case of this VS CS:GO you pay for quality. Oh yeah you also have to install the game twice, once via installer, once via steam, so just downloading this game will take about an hour atleast.",0
"Came here to get an achievement item for tf2, downloaded and installed it, and i was like 'Alright, time to get that achievement.' *6 and 1/2 hours of 'connecting...' screen later* You know what. I really hate this game and I haven't gotten to the main menu yet.",0

how do i fix game from not starting up spent 2 hours downloading this junk wihich ends up with an error and a big F you so I think this game is a big waste of 2 hours of my life and is a load of crap ,0

It's good to TRY out this game. Fun to play at first to get the knife for Team Fortress 2. Then it just gets boring.,0
"I got the game then heard about the special item to get, and did the achievement. however it has been a few hours and the item has not shown up in my steam inventory. what happened? how i get the item?",0
"I used to play this game back in 2009 and fell in love with it. It wasnt pay to win and was good of a game back then. Before when AERIA took over It had a permanent weapon purchase which was great and the repair was reasonable. Now looking at it in 2014, it has ripped my enjoyement as i see now that guns are not permanent, infested with hackers and so many ****** bugs. I wouldve gave this game a 10/10 back in 2009 but to the present ill give this a 3/10 due to hackers, no permanent guns, and bugs.",0
This Game Sucked... End Of Story.,0
"If it wasn't pay to win, it would be alright.",0

DONE. 11/5 - IGN IT'S ALRIGHT. OH AND IF YOU GOING TO ADD YOUR OWN TAGS TO THIS GAME PUT 'WASTE OF TIME' NOW IM DONE.",0
"I was planning to play a round of this damn game to get the TF2 knife. It lags so effin much that its impossible. And it keeps crashing. My graphics settings are at the lowest but that doesn't help at all. Not my PC's fault. You'd expect a i5 + GTX 770 + 8 GB RAM PC to shred this game, right? WRONG. Can't go higher than 5 FPS in the main menu. I can't even get past the main menu  Don't even bother with this piece of crap.  P.S. They also want you to make an Aeria Games account to play it.  UPDATE: So the game seems to have fixed itself. I can play the game now, but its still a crappy, pay to win game that doesn't deserve your time. Unless you're trying to get the TF2 knife. I got it, and it's amazing. The easiest way to get the knife/achievement (1st One Down) is to play (idle) a round of the demolition game mode.  10/10 best knife ever 0/10 worst P2W game ever",0
The game worked well for a while but then crashed and never started again. 2/10,0
Game Sucks A$$,0
"Dont even own this game, Needless to say, it sucks.",0
Aeria games should be ashamed of themselves,0
use to be good when ijji owned it now its a cash cow run into the ground Peanuts Runaway4 life ^^,0
"The only reason I got this game is because I ran out of options for realistic spy knives in tf2, so I went and played this game for a grand total of however many minutes it took me to earn the black rose. Other than netting me that item, this game is pretty worthless. Dont get it unless you need that knife too.",0
it freezes evrytime i try to start it,0
this game used to be good until area games took over now the game is crap.,0

"This game is trash rofl  Installed on SSD but it takes 3-5 minutes to launch and I crashed twice trying to load the tutorial. The third time it worked but took another 5 minutes, then I completed the tutorial and tried to go to the second part and the game crashed after loading for roughly 6-7 minutes.   After that I launched the game again but I had to check something so I tabbed out. A minute or so later I tab in and the game crashes (I WAS IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING MAIN MENU)  Pros: Girl with nice ♥♥♥♥ in tutorial  Cons: I literally couldn't play it  I've never had anything installed on my PC that has run as badly as this. Oh and after reading all the reviews and seeing how the weapon system works, it becomes clear that this is just a bad ripoff of Combat Arms handled by a company that wants to be Nexon, complete with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ payment model for ingame content.",0
cant even start my game,0
"no, just...no. i don't want to hear the words 'A.V.A.' again.",0

"I had to uninstall this game the graphics arent that good, it is a pay to win game, and it just does not make sence. I dont want to be negative but this is true and even though this game is free you should not install it. if you do you get a promotional item for team fortress 2 but it is not worth it.",0
"I'm going to try to write a review that's a little bit more descriptive than the other ones.   AVA is fairly very old game. On high graphics, it looks amazing, albeit, not as good as today's fps games' graphics. The gameplay is fast paced and it feels really good. It was one of the best f2p mmofps's out there. It was even better than some paid fps games. There's a reason as to why I say, 'was one of the best.' That's because everything about this game went to the dumps when ijji handed it over to Aeria Games. Sure, gameplay is relatively the same, but it's just not worth playing anymore. Aeria Games decided to remove one of the best features, permanent guns. If you're bounced around between f2p mmofps games, then you know that permanent guns is a very attractive feature. Permanent guns was one of the reasons that I settled with this game. Next, they decided to make the game pay to win. The only permanent guns that you have are the starter weapons. You need to maintain and repair them by paying with the game's currency. But an update greatly increased the repair prices. In order to maintain your all your guns and still make a profit, you need to play for around 6 hours each day. And those 6 hours aren't even going to pay for the guns that you want to buy. Those are expensive, and they disapear after a month! They made these changes to give players more incentive to play, but in reality, this game has become a chore.  I can no longer recommend this game to anyone because it's not good anymore.",0
"Please, kill this thing with fire.  I can't tell what the gameplay is like because everytime I fricken open it, it crashes.  As I said, kill it with fire, bury 999,999,999,999,999 ft underground, and send a live nuke down there with it.   Also, from what I hear, the servers, weapons, graphics, and just about everything else are complete ♥♥♥♥.",0
Got the game for a fancy knife in a better free to play game.,0
Well just to say this game sucks. Just sucks the whole Pay to win Thing just all of And for the most part the community stinks the games constanlet trying to convince to buy a weapon with real money. Maybe If they didnt have that like most fps shooters these types of games would be great for example tf2 its really the only that dosent want you to waste your money on fancy looking guns. i remeber when artic combat was still a thing. Artic combat was realy good cause for one The game did'nt want let you know that the new colt reskin is up for grabs ONLY FOR 50 ♥♥♥♥ING DOLLARS. But you might have a different opinion that i might not care about but you can think what you want about my review,0
"I only got this ♥♥♥♥ so i could get my knife. get it, get the knife and GET THE HELL OUT",0
this game used to be real fun to play now it is complete ♥♥♥♥ why aeria,0
1 hour to enter the game. 20 mins wasted on searching for a game. 2 hours wasted to get the TF2 knife. Achievements never shows up. Didn't get the knife. Worst experience ever. The whole game is Spawn camping aswell. Would not recommend at all.,0
great until aeria games took over sigh.... Uninstall Simulator,0
"metal sheets are made of wood, wood sheets are made of metal.  10/10 worst F2P game ever",0
i am one of many who want this game for a item iin tf2 so i cant be a lover or a hater really im a but,0
CoD but worse only with no screaming 8 year olds. Just play one round and get the black rose.,0
broken game would uninstall again 9001/10 -ign,0
"Got game. Attempted training just for the heck of it. Wasted 10 minutes trying to blow a stationary person up with a grenade. Uninstalled, got knife in TF2.  Also, I've heard about there being a keylogger within this game. It's meant to encrypt your keypresses to protect against malicious keyloggers. They may have removed it, because I couldn't find the files the community said were used for it. Better safe then sorry, though, so you should check to make sure it isn't there once you install the game.  Reasons for not reccomending? The training session tried to pull me into the game with a set of boobs. Stop this please, game devs. I had to spend 10 minutes to blow a guy up in the training track. I didn't play the game past that.",0
"Stupid game. too many team killers, no punishment for those bich.This game will be worse and worse.",0
"Game installs a rootkit, that does: 'GameGuard hides the game application process, monitors the entire memory range, terminates applications defined by the game vendor and INCA Internet to be cheats (QIP for example), blocks certain calls to Direct X functions and Windows APIs, keylogs your keyboard input[citation needed], and auto-updates itself to change as new possible threats surface.' wikipedia, link is here(  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NProtect_GameGuard  )  if you got this rootkit, go here (  http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/437678-team-fortress-2/61977486  )  It could look like a nice DRM program, something like VAC, but it protects you also when not playing game. It is a keylogger, logging all your pressed keys (steam info, email,...), eating up space on harddrive and resources (RAM, CPU)...  0/10  NEVER INSTALL OR RUN THIS GAME! NOT EVEN FOR TF2 ITEM, IT ISNT WORTH!",0
this game sucks ♥♥♥♥ and u should buy csgo or cod mw3/mw2 instead of this ♥♥♥♥,0
"Ok so I used to play this game about 2011-2012, back when I could care less if a game was f2p and also pay to win. Now that I come back and see the awful pay to win state this game came to be its just sad. And to make matters worse when I did try to start the game it told me about a suspicious program I had that it needed to check, and this 'program' they were using to check it looked like a 5 year old made it. DONT BOTHER PLAYING THIS TRAIN WRECK UNLESS YOUR LORD GABEN HIMSELF",0
"They banned me for no reason. Oh, and it's a pay2win.",0
"Seriously one of the worst F2P, I mean, P2W games. This game doesn't even deserve a proper review. Gameplay sucks, it's not fun, just a generic shooter. The maps are pretty bad, most are setup like paintball arenas, like most F2P shooters. Best guns are the ones you have to pay for. This is my knowledge from, I believe 2012-2013. If it has changed since then, let me know. Haven't played it in a while, and I don't plan to play it again. On a side note, I did get a pretty nice TF2 knife for spy. 1/10",0
It's free-to-play and it shows. It's just not that great. Maps don't have a ton of variety. Hackers are quite present. I recommend investing the money in an actually good FPS (Counter-Strike).,0
"Starting off a bit rough, considering my rig that can play Tomb Raider with that hair crap on, lagged when this opened. Tutorial broke so I skipped it. Customized inventory, or rather, did not. Realized literally everything needed to be bought with real money. Played the game. It's basically Counter-Strike, made by monkeys.  I'd r8 this game -8/8 m8s, plz no h8.",0
i have the achivment first one down and i still don't have the black rose in Tf2 ,0
"Possibly the worst F2P game ever. No consistency, terrible optimization, terrible support from the devs, and as well as an entire game that just doesn't even open when I try to play. Dont spend money on game points, dont spend time grinding. This game sucks. not even a good time waster, and that is saying alot",0
the game don't work,0
This game used to be alot of fun before it became F2P. Now it is just AIDs in the swimming pool of games.  EA isnt even this crappy  Free TF2 knife atleast,0
♥♥♥♥♥t shiiiit dont download !!!,0
"This game isn't too great. The reason I got it is to get the Black Rose, (Yes, I know, download space, gigabites, you did it for one weapon, blah blah blah) but I didn't realize it would be this laggy. I would only considor it if you want to get the black rose, or if you like COD with worse graphics, extreme lag and 5 day weapon trials, or buying it...",0
"Its decent and all but to me, its just another game that wants to make you buy everything with your actually money just so you can actually have decent weapons in the game to stand a chance against anyone and that aspect of any game I hate. Also big ol' SUSPICIOUS PROGRAMS DETECTED crap just from opening the cilent and the most laggest starting menu I have ever seen in my life from a game. I know for a fact that wasn't my computer or my internet, and why the hell would you make Caps lock sprint from SHIFT is always sprint. This game was so bad for me that I had rather go buy rock simulator and play it instead of this game. Game looked like it had lots of potiential but turn out to be ♥♥♥♥. Not even worthy of a 0/10 gg developers.",0
"This game.... Oh god, this game... I have never been so mad at a single game in my entire life. Where do I start... Well, firstly, the launcher is total garbage. It constantly crashes, and this dodgy-as-all-hell program pops up speaking of suspicious programs (the irony is killing me). It's also one of those stupid games that, for some unknown reason, don't allow spaces in their names. After finally creating a suitable username, and FINALLY getting the launcher to not ♥♥♥♥ itself and crash, I got into another... launcher. This time it asked me to create a character. Crashed. Tried again, and asked me to create a character with a name. Name didn't support spaces. After about ten minutes of non-stop crashing, and warnings of suspicious programs, ahem, I finally got into the actual game. It was the tutorial. Game ran at a horrible resolution, one which I didn't even bother to check since I was planning on just playing it for a few minutes to get the Black Rose knife for the Spy in TF2. From what I could tell at the time, the gameplay, or what you might call gameplay, was mediocre at best. First thing I noticed was the abhorrent sound quality. Terrible. I have 7.1 surround headphones, and you know something's not right when it sounds horrible even through that. I finally made it through the tutorial, surprisingly without any crashes. As I got to the main menu I was trying to find the specific achievement for the Black Rose, and couldn't find it in the in-game achievements or even the Steam achievements. When I decided I'd just pay and see how it goes, it crashed. At this point I was getting quite annoyed. After another five or so minutes I actually got into a game. Just about anyway. My first impressions were... just... amazement. Pure amazement, at how people could still play this game, and how there were even people willing to buy the DLC, which are not only overpriced, but most of the stuff isn't even permanent. Anyway, back to the game. The graphics are... well... ♥♥♥♥. So is the sound. And the controls (shift to walk and double-tapping W to run? Oh god...). The guns are a laugh. I have only spent about ten minutes in the actual game, so I haven't seen a lot of the guns, but I have seen the horribly butchered MP5A3 and G3A4. The MP5 has an EOTech optic, and when aimed, you seem to shove your face into the reticle. The G3, on the other hand, has absolutely no sights. Neither does the sidearm (which is a Glock of some sort; never took the time to take a close look at it). I'm probably missing a load of stuff here, and this review is likely all over the place, just like the game itself, because I rarely write reviews, but I just had to convey my anger here. All in all, the most enjoyment I had was uninstalling this despicable addition to the gaming industry in the past millenium.   Edit  I should actually mention that I never got the achievement because of the constant crashing and deplorable gameplay. I literally could not even complete my first match because of this. And I am never trying it again. Ever.",0
This game is great if you play TF2. You will have to endure playing the tutorial but afterwards you can unninstall it and enjoy the Black Rose TF2 promo knife!,0
"this game is fun and all, but even if you pay real money its realy hard to get a 'permanent' gun",0
"This game is a waste of time if you have AMD graphics and/or low to medium spec graphics card, game freezes everytime i try to just change it to full screen, only wants to play on windowed mode that no sane person wants to play on. Am now deleting this game from my library as it is a huge disapointment.",0
AWFUL BUGGY GAME. SLOWEST LOADING GAME EVER. THEN CRASHES WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE SETTINGS IN MAIN MENU. NEVER EVEN GOT TO PLAY THE GAME. WHO KNOWS WHAT ITS LIKE?,0
when i launch it it freezes ;-;,0
cuz u need a accout that dose not work to load,0
Hackers everywhere/10,0
"It was good, but kinda got crappy after a while",0
"This game was totally great until Aeria Games started to take over. Still a good game, but ruined imo",0
"This game is HONESTLY terrible. Gunsounds, textures, GAMEPLAY. I only played it for that TF2 knife.",0
this game wont let u have the black rose!!!,0
just do it for the black rose,0
Was fun until they removed the perm guns,0
Horibal game! I mean there are ads in game for the hacks for it! I joined a game (just to get the blackrose in TF2) and there were as many hacks there as there is snow in Alaska!  Truthfully i cant find anything to say good about this game except for that i had heard that before the hacks and all that this game was actualy good. But I dont rate on the past I rate on the present! So...  0 out of 10! Seriusly RED DUCK Inc. and Aeria Games should be ashamed!!!  I think I have gotten my point across.,0
why did I even play this  go play counterstrike or something,0
"The only reason I would get this game is for the TF2 knife. It is hard to play, and just not fun.",0
"This game is terrible, I only got this for the Black Rose (Knife for Team Fortresss 2) and I must say, playing this was one of the worst experiances of my life, and half of the time I couldn't get it to launch without crashing. So only get this game for the Black Rose if you want it. For entertainment, no.",0
HOW DO U LET THIS WORK ALL I WANT IS MY BLACK ROSE BUT IT KEEPS SAYING FAILED TO CONNECT WTF!!!,0
"Basically cheap CoD, only worth getting for TF2's Black Rose. Still pretty annoying to do.",0
After some updates the game started to go down. No permanent weapons. I only play this game for the tf2 spy knife.,0
very time i start the game for a few seconds it says i have somthing running and closes out of the game i need help someone help me and BTW it says it somthing suspicious and i have nothing running or up ,0
"With frequent updates happening this game keeps rolling to a downhill slope, back then it was a simple, decent-looking, free to play, FPS shooter, Until they decided to put alot of stupid ♥♥♥♥ in the game. It suffered the ♥♥♥♥ like what happened to  Combat Arms on nexon. Until they fix it the way it was back then it was released stay away from this game",0
"A run of the mill, pay-2-win shooter. The gameplay is not bad but there is nothing engaging.",0
"Kind of a trashy poor man's COD. I wouldn't get it unless you didn't have money for Counterstrike or COD, 5/10",0
took for ♥♥♥♥ing ever to install - in the end I had to uninstall an internet explorer security update. then I got shot by a guy.  I did get a cool tf2 knife though,0
this game is good but i find hackers join in-game and ruin the game!!!,0
Bad game is BAD. Does not even work correctly as you have you use the NVLauncher. WASTE,0
♥♥♥♥,0
This was a good game like 3-4 years ago when Aeria was not involved. To bad now its a Pay FOR FREE GAME. Stay away go for Counter Strike or some other games. Very very SAD.,0
I spent 6.9 hours running updates and about six minutes playing this game before I decided it was crap.,0
"oh man, I adored this game. But, it's not worth getting anymore. I love it to death, but it's pay to win, and filled with hackers. Same thing with combat arms. Still get it, though, play 1 full round, and delete it. Because you get a tf2 knife reskin.",0
what sucks about this is that its extremely hard to get money and this game makes it so you literraly waste your money LIKE COME ONE 5 DAYS ARE YOU KIDDING ME,0
I didnt get the black rose the game glitched  ,0
"This game has become complete trash. It is not worth the download, and constant ♥♥♥♥ing updates. It is literally a piece of crap. Do not, under any circumstances download this game, and hope for a balanced, fair game. Hackers are allowed whole-heartedly by Aeria Games. ijji made a huge mistake when saling, and ruined a perfectly fine, balanced and fair game. Thanks Aeria, you ruined yet another great game. Pay2Win is trash. Either make an out-right price, 1 time, or make the game free. My handle was CarmaSin, and you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are all pieces of ♥♥♥♥ that still play this. ♥♥♥♥ you, and suck your mom's ♥♥♥♥. Either you pay2win, or hack, but either way, this game has reached the level of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like Combat Arms. This is the 2nd game I gave just one ♥♥♥♥ about, and it is compelet ♥♥♥♥ now. Never play this game again, not even if it would save the world.",0
"Of course seeing this is a free to play, it still sucks. It did an amzaing job ripping off Counter Strike, and an even better job at making unbalanced gamemodes that I really dont like. Take control points for example. Its takes 2 seconds to capture a point making for a hectic and unfair gamemode. In fact, i think valve needed the promotional weapon for this game just so people would play for 10 minutes. Its the only reason i played it.",0
Something is up... since I can't even F-ing start the game!,0
No players from rank 1-10 on eu servers,0
"whilst its a good enjoyable experience,sadly if you... like me like to play multiplayer games without hacks or cheats,then you will be in for one heck of a kill fest...mostly you dieing lots,wall hackers abound,head shots from no where are comon place.....it was a good game...before the hackers got hold of it .... but you will get 2 days per game update where you will get to actualy stand any chance of competing...far to many clans and they dont share there hacks.....even if you join....trust me its good but only if you can get the hacks they are using....",0
Its not good if you're chatting with friends and this game cannot be in full screen which sucks and trial guns are annoying..,0
"Like nearly every game on ijji except GunZ, its ♥♥♥♥. not like 'The ♥♥♥♥', hell no. Its ♥♥♥♥, a large pile of festering ♥♥♥♥. Take a port of CSS and let EA have a few turns with it, then pass what's left off to 3DRealms. After all that, add microtransactions out the ♥♥♥ and you'll have one of THE WORST shooters since combat arms by nexon.",0
"It much like every other F2P Shooter offers very little in terms of gameplay to make it appealing, there are some people out there who may get enjoyment out of this but honest picking up a copy of Counter-Strike: Source or Global Offensive and playing a Zombie Mod server offers as much if not more content then A.V.A.  The only reason I installed it was for a Team Fortress 2 item.",0
No. Terrible game.,0
"The only reason why my status says 'played' eight hours is that I haven't played it for eight hours. Downloading the game took eight hours! And once I have successfully downloaded it and played it, the whole game just completely stinks. You have to spend money for weapons in order to make them permanent. Play Counter-Strike or something else other than this game. However, if you want the re-skin for the butterfly knife in Team Fortress 2, go right ahead. The knife itself has better value than A.V.A.",0
"Just looking at the download I can tell its a really, really bad game.",0
The graphics are quite bad and the servers are laggy. Thank god I played this as a free to play :(,0
Only played it for the Black Rose for TF2.,0
"Do not get this game. It is a copy of CS:GP, TF2, maybe even Heroes and Generals with realisitic graphics quickly stuck together. Gameplay is horrible, loosk old. Only get if you are looking for a Black Rose in TF2.",0
